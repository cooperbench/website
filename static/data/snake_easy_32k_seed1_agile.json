It's turn 1, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake is currently at [(2,3)], which means it's just the head since there's only one position listed.

Life spans are long, so they won't disappear soon.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, it's just the head. Moving left from (2,3) would take it to (1,3). But I need to check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,3) is within bounds since x=1 is not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. No internal obstacle at (1,3), only at (6,4), which is far away.\n> \n> But I should think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current position: head at (2,3), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is left, I can move left (L), up (U), or down (D), but not right (R) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse means I can't move in the opposite direction immediately. Since current direction is left, opposite is right, so I cannot move right on this turn. So allowed moves: L (continue left), U (up), D (down).\n> \n> Now, food locations: (2,5) is up, (2,2) is down, (2,1) is further down, and (6,6) is far away.\n> \n> (2,5) is at the same x, y=5, so from (2,3), moving up would go to (2,4), then to (2,5) in two moves if I go straight up.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is down, from (2,3) to (2,2) directly.\n> \n> (2,1) is below that.\n> \n> But I need to consider the tail reward danger, but since there is no tail yet, the snake is only head, so no body to collide with. Eating food will increase length, so after eating, there will be a tail.\n> \n> Also, food can spawn under body, but here no body, so all food is accessible.\n> \n> But when I eat food, the length increases, and I need to avoid colliding with the new tail or body.\n> \n> Let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, I should aim for the closest food to minimize risk, but since all food is positive, and life spans are long, I can choose.\n> \n> (2,2) is very close; I can move down to (2,2) this turn and eat it.\n> \n> Current turn t1=1.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), I eat the food there. Since value is +1, length increases to 2. So snake becomes head at (2,2) and tail at (2,3)? No, when I move to (2,2), the head moves to (2,2), and since I ate food, a new segment is added, so positions: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3). Direction would be down now.\n> \n> But when I move, the tail also moves only if I don't eat, but when I eat, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and if you don't eat, the tail moves forward, so length same. If you eat, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, since snake is only head, moving to (2,2) and eating: head now at (2,2), and since it was only head, after eating, there is a new segment at previous position (2,3).

That means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because walls are at the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head at (2,5) and body at (2,4).

Value is 1 for all, so eating any gives +1 to score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,2) and (6,6), life_span is 7 at turn 3, so they disappear after 7 turns, meaning they last until turn 9? Let's clarify: life_span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 3, life_span is 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including turn 3. After turn 3, it will have 6 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has life_span 8 at turn 3.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid:\n> \n> - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (2,5), body at (2,4). So the snake is vertical, head up at (2,5), tail down at (2,4).\n> \n> Head direction is U, so it just moved up to (2,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,4), but (2,4) is the body, so moving down would cause collision with body? Let's see the rules.\n> \n> Collision: body collision if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, the body has only one segment: positions are [(2,5), (2,4)], so head at (2,5), and the only body segment is (2,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,4), that's where the tail is. But since the tail will move forward when I move, it might be okay.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Yes, so moving to the tail cell is safe because after the move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other body parts is deadly.\n> \n> Here, only one body segment, which is the tail. So moving to (2,4) should be safe.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite direction instantly. Head direction is U, so I cannot move Down on next turn? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning the snake was moving up. So on the next turn, I cannot move down, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Confirming: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So from current state, head direction U, so I cannot choose D for turn t=3.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (2,5) at turn 3:\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5)\n> \n> - R: to (3,5)\n> \n> D is not allowed because it's opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Also, (2,4) is the tail, but since I can't move down, it's not an option anyway.\n> \n> Now, check boundaries:\n> \n> - U to (2,6): y=6, is that within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? Let's see: walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are inside, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the grid has rows y=1 to y=6 for y-coordinate.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), with x and y starting from? Probably (1,1) to (6,6) is the playable area.\n> \n> (2,6): x=2, y=6, y=6 should be the top row, since y=7 is wall. y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the highest y before wall.\n> \n> Similarly, y=1 is the lowest.\n> \n> So (2,6) is valid, not a wall.\n> \n> L to (1,5): x=1, y=5, should be valid, since x=0 is wall, x=1 is inside.\n> \n> R to (3,5): x=3, y=5, valid.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (2,2): at x=2,y=2\n> \n> - (6,6): x=6,y=6\n> \n> - (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> All within bounds.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead, but the answer should include actions starting from turn 3.\n> \n> Turn t1=3, so I need actions for turn 3,4,5,6,7,... but how many? The sequence should be for the next few turns, probably until I eat food or something, but I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence of at least 5 moves.\n> \n> But the sequence might be shorter if I eat food or something, but I think I need to output a sequence for several turns.\n> \n> Looking at answer format: \"Action Sequence (in order): Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n> \n> It doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should include at least 5 actions, from turn 3 to turn 7 or 8.\n> \n> Also, for the thinking, I need to explain the strategy.\n> \n> Now, current snake length is 2, since two positions.\n> \n> Eating positive food increases length by 1.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is below, (2,1) is even below, and (6,6) is far.\n> \n> Life spans: at turn 3, (2,2) has life_span 7, so it disappears after turn 9? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 3, life_span=7 means it has 7 turns left: after turn 3, it will be 6, then 5, ..., after turn 9, it would be 0, so disappears before turn 10? Let's define.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span = L, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1\n> \n> - It exists as long as life_span > 0\n> \n> - So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive? Let's see.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, and after that, life_span decreases to L-1 at the start of next turn or after the turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" where N is life_span.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn, if life_span > 0, food is present; after the turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for food at (2,2) with life_span=7 at turn 3:\n> \n> - On turn 3, it is present, life_span=7\n> \n> - After turn 3 (before turn 4), life_span decreases to 6\n> \n> - On turn 4, it is present, life_span=6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - On turn 9, it is present, life_span=1 (since from 7 to 1 in 6 decreases?

That's 3 cells down: from y=5 to y=2, difference of 3 in y.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is further down.\n> \n> But I cannot go down directly because I just came from down? No, head direction is U, meaning I moved up to (2,5), so to go down, I need to change direction.\n> \n> Since I can't reverse immediately, I must move U, L, or R now.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), that's towards the top, away from (2,2).\n> \n> (2,6) is y=6, which is the top row, and walls are at y=7, so (2,6) is safe.\n> \n> But moving up might not be towards food.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n> \n> Then from there, I can go down.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should aim to eat food, but with long-term survival.\n> \n> Since all food is positive, I can eat all, but need to plan the order.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is close, but I need 3 moves down to reach it, but I can't go down now.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is 4 moves down.\n> \n> (6,6) is far: from (2,5) to (6,6), delta x=4, delta y=1, so at least 5 moves with turns.\n> \n> But life spans are long, 7 and 8 turns left, so I have time.\n> \n> But I should start moving towards one.\n> \n> Moreover, after eating, snake grows, so I need to avoid colliding with myself.\n> \n> Now, let's simulate possible sequences.\n> \n> First, at turn 3, possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), then snake positions: head to (2,6), body: previous head (2,5) becomes body, tail (2,4) might move? When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (2,5), index 1: tail (2,4)\n> \n> After move, if I move head to new position, say (2,6), then new head is (2,6), and the body segment moves to previous head position (2,5), so new positions: [(2,6), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail was (2,4), but since we moved, the tail is removed? No, when snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the segment that was at (2,4) is no longer part of snake, so snake has new head and the body moves up.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving to empty cell, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and tail is left.\n> \n> So from [(2,5), (2,4)]:\n> \n> If move U to (2,6), new head (2,6), then the body segment (index 1) moves to where head was, (2,5). So new positions: [(2,6), (2,5)]\n> \n> The cell (2,4) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But for now, no eating.\n> \n> At turn 3, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Let me consider moving towards (2,2).\n> \n> But I can't go down now, so I need to go left or right first to change direction.\n> \n> For example, move R to (3,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 4, head at (3,5), direction from (2,5) to (3,5) is R, so direction now R.\n> \n> Then I can move down, since down is not opposite to right.\n> \n> Opposite of R is L, so I can move D, U, or R, not L.\n> \n> From (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5), not L to (2,5) because reverse.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (1,5) at turn 3, then at turn 4, head at (1,5), direction L, so can move U, D, L, not R.\n> \n> Now, to go to (2,2), I need to be at (2,2) with head moving onto it.\n> \n> (2,2) is currently empty, I think, since snake is at (2,5) and (2,4), so (2,2) is free.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,2), so when head moves to (2,2), it eats it.\n> \n> But to reach (2,2) from (2,5), I need to move down multiple times.\n> \n> But since I can't move down immediately, I need to go sideways first.\n> \n> For example, sequence to reach (2,2):\n> \n> - Turn 3: move R to (3,5)  // now at (3,5)\n> \n> - Turn 4: move D to (3,4)  // now at (3,4), direction D\n> \n> - Turn 5: move L to (2,4)  // but (2,4) was tail, but now it might be empty or something\n> \n> After turn 3: moved to (3,5), snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5)]  // head (3,5), body (2,5), tail was (2,4) removed.\n> \n> Initial: turn 3 start, positions [(2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> After move: head to new position, say (3,5) if R, so new head (3,5), body moves to (2,5), so positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> (2,4) is free.\n> \n> Turn 4: from (3,5), move D to (3,4), so new head (3,4), body moves to (3,5), positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Turn 5: from (3,4), I can move L to (2,4), which is free, so head to (2,4), positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> Then turn 6: from (2,4), move D to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (2,4)]\n> \n> Turn 7: move D to (2,2), now at (2,2), which has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3, positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3), and tail at (2,4)? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so after moving to food, head at (2,2), body segments: previous head position becomes body, but since eating, a new segment is added at the tail position or something.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So positions: after move to food, head at new position, body includes all previous segments, no tail movement.\n> \n> For example, before move to food: positions [(2,3), (2,4)]  // head at (2,3), tail at (2,4)\n> \n> Move head to (2,2), which has food, so eat: new head at (2,2), the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position?

Head direction is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 6, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span given. For example, (2,2) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns from now, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 4, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N more turns. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, after this turn (turn 4), life span decreases to 5, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (2,2) with life span 6 at turn 4:\n> \n> - After turn 4, life span = 5\n> \n> - After turn 5, life span = 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 9, life span = 0, so it disappears at the end of turn 9? Or at the beginning of turn 10?\n> \n> The problem says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, the life span is L, then after the turn, it decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for planning, since we're at turn 4, and life span 6, it will be available for 6 more turns, meaning it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think this means it will be present for N more turns, including the current one. So with life span N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 4, life span 6, so:\n> \n> - Turn 4: available\n> \n> - Turn 5: available (life span 5)\n> \n> - Turn 6: available (life span 4)\n> \n> - Turn 7: available (life span 3)\n> \n> - Turn 8: available (life span 2)\n> \n> - Turn 9: available (life span 1)\n> \n> - After turn 9, life span 0, so disappears, not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (6,6): life span 6, same as above.\n> \n> (2,1): life span 7, so available until turn 10.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 10, available until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(3,5), (2,5)], head at (3,5), direction right, so it just moved to (3,5) from (2,5)? Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so head is (3,5), then body is (2,5). Since it was moving right, it came from left, so previous head was at (2,5), and it moved right to (3,5), so tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is R (right), I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move left immediately.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries. Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the current positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,5)\n> \n> Available moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> - (3,6): y=6, walls at y=7, so y=6 is within 0 to 7, yes.\n> \n> - (3,4): y=4, within bounds.\n> \n> - (4,5): x=4, within x=0 to 7.\n> \n> No obstacles at these points except walls, but walls are only at borders, so as long as not x=0,7 or y=0,7, it's fine. (3,6) is y=6, not 7, so ok. Similarly others.\n> \n> (6,4) is an obstacle, but that's not near here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns. Since the snake is short, only 2 segments, eating food will increase length.\n> \n> Also, note that food can spawn under body, but in this case, no food is under the snake. Snake is at (3,5) and (2,5), food is at (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4). None of these are under snake, so no issue.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (2,5), and head is at (3,5), so adjacent horizontally. But the tail cell (2,5) does not have food; food is elsewhere. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Possible food targets:\n> \n> - (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is close to head at (3,5). Distance: |5-3|=2 in x, |4-5|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 3.\n> \n> - (2,2) is at x=2,y=2, distance |2-3|=1, |2-5|=3, so Manhattan 4.\n> \n> - (6,6) is x=6,y=6, |6-3|=3, |6-5|=1, Manhattan 4.\n> \n> - (2,1) is x=2,y=1, |2-3|=1, |1-5|=4, Manhattan 5.\n> \n> (5,4) is closest at distance 3.\n> \n> Life spans: all have decent life, (5,4) has life 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to think about the path and future moves.\n> \n> Also, since snake is short, growing is important for survival, but must avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and internal at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,5), tail (2,5)\n> \n> Food: (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4)\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), then head at (4,5), tail moves to (3,5), so snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (5,5), (4,6), (4,4), but not left to (3,5) since it would be reverse? Direction: after moving right, head direction is R, so cannot move L to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body, so moving left would be into body, which is collision, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> But (5,4) is at (5,4), which is down from (4,5) or left from (5,5), etc.\n> \n> I should think about reaching (5,4) first since it's close and positive.\n> \n> Path to (5,4) from (3,5):\n> \n> One way: move R to (4,5), then D to (4,4)? (4,4) to (5,4) is right, but from (4,5), moving D to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (5,4) is R.\n> \n> (4,4) is empty? Let's see.\n> \n> After move R to (4,5), snake is at [(4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Then from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), U to (4,6), R to (5,5), or L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, so invalid. So possible: U, D, R.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4), snake becomes [(4,4), (4,5)]? Positions: head to (4,4), body was (4,5)? After moving to (4,5), body is (3,5). When head moves to (4,4), the body moves: tail moves away, so the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where head was? Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n> \n> Initially: positions [A, B] where A=head, B=tail.\n> \n> After move, new head position, then body segments follow: new position 1 is new head, position 2 is old head, and tail is removed if no growth, but when eating, tail grows.\n> \n> Without eating, when moving, the tail moves away, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> In this case, no eating yet.\n> \n> So from [(3,5), (2,5)], move R to (4,5): new head (4,5), then body is old head (3,5), so snake is [(4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail was (2,5), which is now gone, so (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> Then from [(4,5), (3,5)], if move D to (4,4): new head (4,4), body is (4,5), so snake [(4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to (5,4) or (4,3) or (3,4), etc.\n> \n> (5,4) is at (5,4), which is adjacent right from (4,4)? (4,4) to (5,4) is right, yes.\n> \n> But (5,4) has food, so if I move to (5,4), I eat it.\n> \n> Now, is (5,4) safe? After moving to (4,4), if I move R to (5,4), head at (5,4), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows: head moves to (5,4), body is (4,4), and since I ate, tail doesn't move away, so a new segment is added, so snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]? Positions: when head moves to food, it eats, so length increases. So from [(4,4), (4,5)], head moves to (5,4), eats, so new positions: head (5,4), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, and tail (4,5) remains, but since length increases, a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake at [(4,4), (4,5)]  // head (4,4), body (4,5)\n> \n> Move head to (5,4), which has food, so eat: new head (5,4), body segments: the old head (4,4) becomes first body, then the previous body (4,5) remains, so snake is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> Yes, length 3 now.\n> \n> But (5,4) is the food position, and it's not under body, so eating is fine.\n> \n> In this path, to reach (5,4):\n> \n> Turn 4: move R to (4,5)\n> \n> Then turn 5: move D to (4,4)\n> \n> Then turn 6: move R to (5,4) and eat.\n> \n> But at turn 6, life span of (5,4) was 10 at turn 4, so after turn 4, life 9, turn 5 life 8, turn 6 life 7, still available.\n> \n> But I need to think if this is safe.\n> \n> After eating, snake is at (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4): U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision, so invalid, R to (6,4) but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Walls: internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> So from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or R but (6,4) wall, so only U or D.\n> \n> Cannot go left to (4,4) body.\n> \n> So if I go to (5,4), I might get stuck if not careful.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), I have to move U or D.\n> \n> Say move U to (5,5), then snake moves to [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]? Positions: head to (5,5), body: old head (5,4), then (4,4), and tail was (4,5), but when head moves, tail moves away, so (4,5) is gone, and since I ate at turn 6, when I moved to (5,4), I ate, so at turn 6, after eating, snake is [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] length 3.\n> \n> Then at turn 7, I move from (5,4) to, say, U to (5,5): new head (5,5), body: old head (5,4) becomes first body, then (4,4) becomes second body, and tail (4,5) moves away?

Wait, x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 means the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the snake can move to any cell not occupied by a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5). Since head direction is down, and positions are head first, so (3,4) is head, (3,5) is the body. Head direction D means down, so it was moving down to (3,4) from previous position? Let's see the positions: [(3,4), (3,5)]. If head is at (3,4) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (3,4), so previous head was at (3,5) or something? Positions are given as current positions, so at turn 5, head is at (3,4), and the body segment is at (3,5). Since it's a snake of length 2, only two segments.\n> \n> Head direction D means the snake was moving downward, so from the previous turn, it was at (3,5) and moved down to (3,4), so now head is (3,4), tail is (3,5). On the next move, if it moves in some direction, the tail will move to where the head was or something? In Snake, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail follows, so the last segment is removed if no food is eaten.\n> \n> Food positions: listed as (x, y, life_span, value). From the input: (2,2,5,1), (6,6,5,1), (2,1,6,1), (5,4,9,1). So:\n> \n> - Food at (2,2): value +1, life_span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 5, life_span 5, it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify life_span.\n> \n> Life_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life_span L, it exists for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life_span N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think it's better to think: at the start of turn, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of the turn. If after decrease, L-1 = 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L or something. But to simplify, since we're at turn 5, for each food:\n> \n> - (2,2,5,1): life_span 5 at turn 5, so it exists for turns 5,6,7,8,9? Countdown starts at 5 on turn 5, decreases to 4 at turn 6, to 3 at turn 7, etc., down to 0 at turn 10? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Assume: at turn t, life_span L means it has L turns left including the current one. So it can be eaten during turn t, and if not eaten, it will disappear after turn t+L-1? I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Let me look back at the core rules: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Perhaps: when food spawns, it has life_span N, meaning it will last for N turns. Each turn, the countdown decreases by 1, starting from N down to 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\" – it's ambiguous.\n> \n> To make it clear, let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, life_span decreases to L-1. If L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (2,2): life_span 5 at turn 5, so it can be eaten on turn 5,6,7,8,9 (since after turn 9, life_span would be 0, so it disappears).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6,5,1): life_span 5 at turn 5, exists turns 5-9.\n> \n> (2,1,6,1): life_span 6 at turn 5, exists turns 5-10.\n> \n> (5,4,9,1): life_span 9 at turn 5, exists turns 5-13.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(3,4), (3,5)], head at (3,4), direction down. Since direction is down, and it moved to (3,4), previous head was at (3,5) I think, but now head is (3,4), so it can move to adjacent cells: up to (3,5), but (3,5) is the body, so moving there would cause collision unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Movement constraints: can move U, D, L, R to adjacent cells, but cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up) next turn because that would be instant reverse. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So current head direction is D, so I cannot move U on turn 5. Possible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> But (3,5) is occupied by the body, so moving there would cause collision because head touches body segment, except if it's the tail and tail moves, but let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok. In this case, the snake has two segments: head at (3,4), tail at (3,5). If I move the head to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the tail, but since the tail will move, it might be safe, but when the head moves to (3,5), at that moment, the tail is still there, so head touches body, but since the tail moves immediately after, it might not collide. But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is allowed and safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to other cells.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (6,4).\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls at borders and (6,4).\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is free, but x=6, y=4 is an internal obstacle, so (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So free cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (6,4).\n> \n> Now, from head (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) – currently tail, but can move there safely\n> \n> - D: to (3,3) – should be free, let's check if wall or body. (3,3) is within bounds, not a wall, no body.\n> \n> - L: to (2,4) – should be free\n> \n> - R: to (4,4) – should be free, but (4,4) is not wall.\n> \n> But cannot move U because no instant reverse?

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates probably range from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> - Internal obstacle: (6,4). So I can't move to (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (4,4), body at (3,4). So the snake has two segments: head and one body part, which is also the tail since there are only two positions. Snake length is 2.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so current moving direction is right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 5\n> - (5,4) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: Each food disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for (2,2), life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 10 (since turn 6 counts as one, so turns 6,7,8,9 it exists, gone on turn 10). Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 4, present from turn 6 to 9 (disappears on turn 10)\n> - (6,6): life span 4, present turn 6 to 9\n> - (2,1): life span 5, present turn 6 to 10 (disappears turn 11)\n> - (5,4): life span 8, present turn 6 to 13 (disappears turn 14)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.

So after eating, snake will have three segments: new head at (5,4), old head (4,4) becomes body, and old tail (3,4) is still tail, but since I grow, a new tail segment is added? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of positions: before move, snake is [(4,4), (3,4)].\n> \n> After moving right to (5,4), if (5,4) has food, I eat it, so the head moves to (5,4), and the tail stays, so new positions: head at (5,4), body at (4,4), and tail at (3,4). So snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] with length 3.\n> \n> If no food, moving right would move head to (5,4), tail moves off (3,4), so snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4)] but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) has food, so if I move right, I eat it.\n> \n> But is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,4). Head is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (3,4) since it's one cell left.\n> \n> (4,4) and (3,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,4), not at the tail.\n> \n> Tail reward danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself, and head is adjacent to tail, then eating that food causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on adjacent cells, but since tail is where food was, after eating, the new tail is added, but let's think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is not on the tail cell; tail is at (3,4), food is at (5,4). So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Also, (5,4) is not a wall or obstacle. Walls: borders and (6,4). (5,4) is within bounds, x=5,y=4, not 0 or 7, and not (6,4), so it's safe.\n> \n> But (6,4) is an obstacle, so I can't go there, but (5,4) is fine.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,4), I eat the food, grow to length 3.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead. After that, where can I go?\n> \n> Head at (5,4), direction was R, so now I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since I was moving right, I cannot move left (opposite) on the next turn. So possible moves: U, D, R. But R to (6,4) is obstacle, so I cannot move right. (6,4) is wall, so moving right from (5,4) to (6,4) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> So from (5,4), after eating, I can move up or down, or left, but left is opposite? Current direction is R, so moving left is opposite, so I cannot move left on the next turn. Only U or D.\n> \n> Let's confirm movement constraints.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So after moving right to (5,4), the new head direction is R.

No, I can go up or down first, then around.\n> \n> From (5,4), if I go up to (5,5), then I can go right to (6,5), but (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) might be okay if not wall. Walls are borders and (6,4). Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,5) is x=6,y=5, which is not border since x=6 is not 0 or 7? x=7 is border, x=6 is fine, y=5 fine. Only specific cells: border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (6,5) is x=6,y=5, not 0 or 7, so not border. Obstacle is only (6,4), so (6,5) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) should be accessible if I go to (5,5) then (6,5) then (6,6), etc.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to decide the action for turn 6.\n> \n> Options: from (4,4), direction R, so I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction is R, so I cannot move L (opposite) on this turn? No, the rule is for next turn, but for the current move, since I'm moving now, I can choose any direction except possibly reverse, but let's read.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", meaning after the current move, for the subsequent move, I cannot reverse direction.\n> \n> For the current turn, I can choose any direction: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But if I move L, that would be left to (3,4), but (3,4) is the current tail. In snake, moving to the tail is usually safe because the tail will move away, but here, since the snake is only two segments, moving to (3,4) might be a problem.\n> \n> Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"**Deadly Collisions**: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by the tail is safe, because the tail moves, so it's not there anymore after the move.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (3,4), which is the tail, it should be safe because after moving, the tail moves away, so head is at (3,4), and the body (which was head) is at (4,4), but let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (4,4), body (3,4).\n> \n> If I move left to (3,4), which is occupied by tail. After move, head moves to (3,4), and since I didn't eat, tail moves off (3,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard: when you move, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves off its current cell.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,4), which is the current tail position:\n> \n> - Head moves from (4,4) to (3,4)\n> \n> - The body segment at (3,4) was tail, but since head moves to (3,4), and tail moves away, but the body segment at (3,4) will move to where?

Since (3,4) was occupied by tail, but it's the tail, and we're moving to it. After head moves to (3,4), the segment that was at (3,4) (the tail) is no longer part of the snake? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: the head moves to the new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then, the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the first body position, and so on, and the tail is the last one.\n> \n> Here, only two segments: head and tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the tail segment moves to the old head position.\n> \n> So, if I move left to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head position: (3,4)\n> \n> - The tail (which was at (3,4)) moves to the old head position (4,4)\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,4), tail at (4,4).

It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly for y. But walls occupy those cells, so I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4). So the snake is horizontal, facing right, from left to right: body at (3,4), body at (4,4), head at (5,4). Head direction is R, which matches the position; moving right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 3, value +1\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider how many turns left before they disappear.\n> \n> Current turn is 7, so:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 7 + 3 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 7, life span 3 means:\n> \n> - Turn 7: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 8: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 9: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 10: gone? Or after turn 9?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think in terms of remaining life. At turn t, food has life span L, so it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t, after k turns, at turn t+k, the countdown is N - k. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown starts at N, then at turn t+1, it's N-1, ..., down to 0, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for N=3 at turn 7:\n> \n> - Turn 7: countdown 3 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 8: countdown 2 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 9: countdown 1 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 10: countdown 0, disappears before or at turn 10? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> Let's parse: \"disappears after N turns\" – after N turns have passed, it is gone. So if at turn t, it appears, it disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> But here, it's given at turn t with life span N, so it will disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 7, life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns, meaning at turn 10 it is gone. So it exists on turns 7,8,9, and gone on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, countdown: at turn 7, countdown=3; turn 8, countdown=2; turn 9, countdown=1; turn 10, not present.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So for each food:\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 3, at turn 7, so exists turns 7,8,9, gone turn 10.\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 3, exists turns 7,8,9, gone turn 10.\n> \n> - (2,1): life span 4, exists turns 7,8,9,10, gone turn 11.\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 10, exists for many turns, up to turn 17.\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)], head at (5,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.

Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,4), which is within bounds. x=5, y=4, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (6,4), which is a wall cell.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is a food position.\n> \n> Now, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n> \n> Similarly x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 playable, except internal walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), which is playable cell but occupied by wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So available cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> (6,4) is at x=6, y=4, which is the border? x=6, but x=7 is wall, x=6 might be playable, but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall, not playable.\n> \n> Similarly, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, and additionally (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now snake: head (5,4), body (4,4), tail (3,4). All at y=4, x=3,4,5.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), moving right, so if I move R, to (6,4), but (6,4) is a wall! Internal obstacle, so I cannot move there, it would be a wall collision.\n> \n> Important: I must avoid moving into walls.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: up to (5,5)\n> \n> - D: down to (5,3)\n> \n> - L: left to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by the body segment.\n> \n> Body collision: if head touches any body segment, it dies. But there's an exception for the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,4), if I move L to (4,4), (4,4) is currently occupied by the body segment, which is not the tail; the tail is at (3,4). So (4,4) is the second segment, not tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,4), which is occupied by body, it would be a collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: body (4,4), index 2: tail (3,4).\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, then body segments follow.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail cell and tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to the current tail position, and the tail moves forward, then it's ok, no collision.\n> \n> But if head moves to a non-tail body cell, collision.\n> \n> Here, (4,4) is the body segment, not tail, so moving to (4,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,4) itself, but that's not possible, moves are to adjacent.\n> \n> So from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: (5,5) - is this free? Need to check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> (5,5): no wall mentioned, not snake position, so should be free.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) - similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - L: (4,4) - occupied by body, collision if moved there.\n> \n> - R: (6,4) - but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> Cannot move L or R.\n> \n> R is wall, L is body.\n> \n> So must choose U or D for turn 7.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R, but since I'm moving U or D, it's not opposite, so ok. Opposite would be L, which I can't do anyway.\n> \n> After moving, the new head direction will be U or D.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (2,2): positive, needs to be eaten soon, life span 3, so only until turn 9.\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 3, until turn 9.\n> \n> - (2,1): life span 4, until turn 10.\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> (4,5) is close, at y=5, x=4.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,4), so (4,5) is adjacent? (5,4) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> (5,4) and (4,5): Δx=1, Δy=1, not adjacent; adjacent cells share a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So from (5,4), (4,5) is not directly reachable; it's one move away but not adjacent in the grid sense; to go to (4,5), I need to move left to (4,4) or up to (5,5), then to (4,5) or something.\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied, so I can't move directly to (4,5) from here.\n> \n> First, for turn 7, I must move U or D.\n> \n> Let me consider options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,5)\n> \n> Then head at (5,5), body follows: the body segments move to previous positions, so new positions: head (5,5), then body (5,4), then tail (4,4). Original positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5), the body segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was, (5,4), and tail at (3,4) moves to where the first body was, (4,4). So new snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Tail is now at (4,4).\n> \n> Direction was R, now moving U.\n> \n> Option 2: Move D to (5,3)\n> \n> Then head to (5,3), body: (5,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's see: head was at (5,4) moves to (5,3), so new head (5,3). Then body segment at (4,4) moves to previous head position (5,4). Tail at (3,4) moves to previous body position (4,4). So new snake: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to plan ahead to eat food and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is close; at (4,5), which is adjacent to current position?

Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on next turn.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - y=6, is this wall? y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, not wall.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - but (5,4) is occupied by the body segment. Is it safe? (5,4) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - free? Not wall, not snake, should be free.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - free? x=6,y=5, not wall, since internal obstacle only at (6,4), so (6,5) is free.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, L, R. Cannot D because body.\n> \n> And cannot move down because it's opposite to current direction? Current direction is U, so moving D is opposite, and cannot do instant reverse, so indeed cannot move D.\n> \n> So from (5,5), can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,5) is right there! (4,5) has food with value +1 and long life.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5), I can eat it.\n> \n> But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Moving to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), which is food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move? Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so tail stays in place.\n> \n> Snake positions: current [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Head moves to (4,5). Since (4,5) has food, I eat it, so new head at (4,5), then the body segments: the first body at (5,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> - If food is eaten, head moves to new cell with food, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move; the snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: after move, if head moves to food, then the new position is the head, and the tail remains, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> Positions: let’s say before move, snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving head to new cell:\n> \n> - If no food eaten: new snake [NewH, H, B1, B2, ..., ] but without the last segment?

So it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 2, same thing.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 3, so it lasts until after turn 10?

So if head moves to a new position, the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where the head was, but since head is moving, the body follows.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to (x,y), then the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After movement: head is now at (5,5), the first body segment moves to where the head was, (5,6), and the tail moves to where the first body was, (5,5)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Position 0 (head): (5,6)\n> \n> - Position 1: (5,5)\n> \n> - Position 2 (tail): (5,4)\n> \n> If head moves down to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then, the segment that was at position 1 ( (5,5) ) needs to move to the previous head position, which is (5,6). But (5,6) is now free? Not yet occupied.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5), the cell (5,5) is now occupied by the head, but it was occupied by position 1. Then position 1 moves to (5,6), which was the previous head position. Position 2 (tail) moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is now the head, so it would be moving to a cell that is being occupied.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: when the head moves to a new cell, it occupies that cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (5,5):\n> \n> - New position 0: (5,5)\n> \n> - Position 1 moves to where position 0 was, so to (5,6)\n> \n> - Position 2 moves to where position 1 was, so to (5,5)\n> \n> But (5,5) is now position 0, so position 2 is moving to (5,5), which is the same as position 0. Collision! The head and the tail would be on the same cell.\n> \n> That's not right. When position 2 moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is already occupied by the new head, so it's a collision.\n> \n> In general, moving to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail can cause collision, but moving to the tail is safe only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, if I move down to (5,5), which is currently the position of the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (5,4). So moving to (5,5) is moving to a body segment that is not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I were to move to (5,4), the tail, it might be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm with the positions.\n> \n> Current: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (5,4)\n> \n> If I move down to (5,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by body segment, so collision happens immediately when head tries to move there, I think. Before the body moves.\n> \n> The collision is checked when the head moves: if the new head position is a wall or a body segment (except the tail under certain conditions), it dies.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

(6,4) is blocked, but (6,6) is not necessarily blocked unless it's a wall, but walls are only borders and internal obstacles specified.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given as (6,4), so (6,6) is free, but has food.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) is a food position with life_span 1, so it might be eaten.\n> \n> Now, moving to (6,6): since it's food, eating it would increase length.\n> \n> But let's list possible actions.\n> \n> From (5,6), head direction U.\n> \n> Invalid moves: U (wall), D (body collision).\n> \n> Valid moves: L to (4,6), or R to (6,6).\n> \n> R to (6,6) is possible.\n> \n> Now, (6,6) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food life spans.\n> \n> Food at (2,2): life_span 1, turn 9, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): life_span 1, must be eaten this turn.\n> \n> (2,1): life_span 2, so can be eaten this turn or next.\n> \n> (4,5): life_span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,6). To eat (2,2) or (2,1), it's far, at (2,2) and (2,1), while I'm at (5,6). Distance is |5-2| + |6-2| = 3+4=7 for (2,2), similarly for (2,1) |5-2| + |6-1| = 3+5=8, too far to reach this turn. (6,6) is adjacent, at (6,6), which is one step right.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is |5-4| + |6-5| =1+1=2, so two steps away: e.g., left then down, or something.\n> \n> But I can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> So immediate options: move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (6,6), then the body segments follow. Since I ate food, a new tail is added, so positions become: head (6,6), then (5,6), then (5,5), then (5,4). Original tail was (5,4), but after growth, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Standard: when food is eaten, the snake moves forward, and the tail does not move, so length increases.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,6) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Body: (5,6)  // previous head\n> \n> - Body: (5,5)  // previous position 1\n> \n> - Tail: (5,4)  // previous tail, now extended, so tail is still (5,4) until next move?

Moving right would be to (7,6), which is a border wall, so it can't move right. Therefore, at turn 10, I must choose a different direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head is at (6,6), and current direction is R, I cannot move left (opposite direction) immediately because of no instant reverse rule. So possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or Right (R). But R leads to (7,6) which is wall, so invalid. So only U or D are possible.\n> \n> U: (6,6) to (6,7) – y=7 is wall, so invalid? y=7 is border, so (6,7) is wall, can't move there.\n> \n> D: (6,6) to (6,5) – that should be free? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4). So (6,5) is not occupied by body? Let's list all occupied cells: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4). So (6,5) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Also, walls: (6,7) is y=7 wall, (7,6) is x=7 wall. Internal obstacle at (6,4)? (6,4) is an obstacle? Snake has (5,4), which is different.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4)\n> \n> So (6,4) is blocked by obstacle, not by snake.\n> \n> Now, for (6,6):\n> \n> - Move U to (6,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Move D to (6,5): is this free? (6,5) not occupied by snake or wall? Walls are only borders and internal obstacles. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) is within bounds, x=6 between 0 and 7? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: only (6,4)\n> \n> So grid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,6):\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (6,5) – let's check: x=6, y=5. Not border wall, not internal obstacle (internal is (6,4), which is different), and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4). So (6,5) is free? (6,5) not in list, so yes, free.\n> \n> - L: to (5,6) – but (5,6) is occupied by the body, the second segment.

So moving to (5,6) would be head touching body, collision.\n> \n> - R: to (7,6) – x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,5)? But I thought L might be possible if it's the tail, but (5,6) is not tail; tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (6,6), index 1: (5,6), index 2: (5,5), index 3: tail (5,4).\n> \n> So moving left to (5,6): that's the position of segment 1, which is a body part, not tail. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so if head moves to a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and we're eating food or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (5,6), that is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, if I go there, the head moves to (5,6), but that cell was occupied, so it would collide unless it's the tail.\n> \n> But (5,6) is not the tail; tail is (5,4). So moving to (5,6) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,6), only possible move is down to (6,5), since up, right, left are all invalid or deadly.\n> \n> Left is to (5,6), which is body, deadly.\n> \n> Up to wall, right to wall, down to (6,5) which is free.\n> \n> Is (6,5) free? Cells: walls: borders and (6,4). (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is not border (x=6 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7), and not (6,4), so yes, free. Also not occupied by snake, as per positions.\n> \n> So only possible action at turn 10 is to move Down to (6,5).\n> \n> But let me confirm the direction: current head direction is R (right). Moving down is not opposite, so it's allowed. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is R, opposite is L, but L is deadly anyway, so moving D is fine.\n> \n> So for turn 10, I must move D to (6,5).\n> \n> Now, after that, the snake will be: head at (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), and tail was (5,4), but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so new positions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), then (5,6), then (5,5). Tail is now (5,5)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So current positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n> \n> After move down to (6,5): new head at (6,5), then the previous head (6,6) becomes body, so positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), then the old body: (5,6) becomes the next, and (5,5) becomes the last, and (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, head direction is now D (down), since I moved down.\n> \n> Food: (2,1) life span 2, current turn 10, so after turn 10, life span decreases to 1. After turn 11, it disappears.\n> \n> (4,5) life span 7, so after turn 10, life span 6, etc.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 10, after turn 10, life span 9.\n> \n> I need to plan for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n> \n> Current turn is 10, so I need to think from turn 10 to turn 15 or so.\n> \n> But at turn 10, I have to move down, as established.\n> \n> Then for turn 11, head at (6,5), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction down, cannot move up (opposite).\n> \n> So possible: down, left, right? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Possible: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> Move D to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Move L to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the tail.

In this case, (5,5) has no food, I assume? Food positions are (2,1), (4,5), (3,1). (5,5) is not listed, so no food there.\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) should be safe; head moves to (5,5), tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Move R to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (5,5) or D to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so only L to (5,5) is possible.\n> \n> D is invalid, R invalid, U forbidden because opposite? Current direction D, so cannot move U, but U is to (6,6), which is body anyway, not tail.\n> \n> U to (6,6): (6,6) is occupied by body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,5).

Let's see: the segment that was at (5,5) is now head, but when head moves to a cell, it becomes new head, and the body follows.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if not eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So current: index: 0 head (6,5), 1 (6,6), 2 (5,6), 3 tail (5,5)\n> \n> After moving left to (5,5): new head at (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, so now segment 0: (5,5), then segment 1: the previous head position (6,5), segment 2: previous segment 1 position (6,6), segment 3: previous segment 2 position (5,6).

So, I can't move to those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,5), then body segments at (6,6), (5,6), and tail at (5,5). The head direction is down (D), which means last move was down, so from (6,6) to (6,5), I think? Let's list the positions in order: index 0 is head: (6,5), index 1: (6,6), index 2: (5,6), index 3: (5,5). Since head direction is D, that means the snake was moving down to reach (6,5). So from (6,6) to (6,5) is down.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life_span 1\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 6 and life_span 1? Wait, the format says: (x,y, life_span, value) I think? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but in the input it's written as (2,1,1,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (4,5,6,1) and (3,1,9,1).\n> \n> In the state: \" (2, 1, 1, 1) \" – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value).

But it says value=1, but earlier it says positive food has value +1, negative has -1, but here value=1 for all? Let's check.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\": and it says \" (2, 1, 1, 1) \" so probably (x,y, life_span, value).

Okay.\n> \n> Life_span: for (2,1) it's 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". Current turn is 11, so for food at (2,1) with life_span=1, after this turn (turn 11), it will disappear. Since countdown decreases on turn 11, and life_span=1, so after turn 11, it's gone. Meaning on turn 11, it can still be eaten, but after that, not.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life_span=6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, i.e., turn 17.\n> \n> (3,1) life_span=9, disappears after turn 20.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,5), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is D, I can move down, left, or right?

Walls include internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,5) – (5,5) is the tail position.

The segments: previous head (6,5) becomes body, so new positions: head at (5,5), then body: (6,5), (6,6), and tail (5,6)? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (5,5), which was occupied by tail at (5,5), but after move, the tail was at (5,5), now head moves there, but the tail segment should move to where?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, new head position: (5,5) for this move.\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at index 0 (head) becomes body at (6,5), so index 1 now at (6,5)?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life_span N at turn t, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, after turn t, life_span becomes N-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, life_span N-2, ..., after turn t + N - 1, life_span=1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, food at turn t with life_span N:\n> \n> - Can be eaten on turns from t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> - On turn t + N, it is gone.\n> \n> Here, turn t=11.\n> \n> Food (2,1): life_span=1, so can be eaten only on turn 11.

It's turn 12. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).

Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 12, life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current one. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on this turn. If L=2, it disappears after next turn, so you can eat it this turn or next turn.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 12, food at (4,5) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 12 + 6 - 1 = turn 17? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 12: life span 6, countdown starts.\n> \n> After turn 12, countdown becomes 5 (since it decreases every turn including current?

Turns 12 to 17 inclusive is 6 turns? Let's count: turn 12,13,14,15,16,17 — that's 6 turns, but life span N=6 means it lasts for N turns, so available from turn t to t+N-1.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span N at turn t, it is available for N turns: turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1.\n> \n> So for (4,5): life span 6 at turn 12, so available from turn 12 to 17 (turns 12,13,14,15,16,17 — that's 6 turns).\n> \n> Similarly, food (3,1) has life span 8 at turn 12, so available from turn 12 to 19 (turns 12 to 19 inclusive, 8 turns: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19).\n> \n> Now, food values: both have value 1, so positive food.

After move, snake will have head at new position, and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to (5,6), which is current tail, then after move, the new snake positions: head at (5,6), then body segments: (5,5) becomes first body, then (6,5), then (6,6) becomes tail?

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments at (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,6)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,6)\n> \n> The snake has 5 segments. Head direction is left (L), so it was moving left to get to (4,5) from, say, (5,5) but (5,5) is the first body segment, so it must have come from right. Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so from (4,5) to (5,6), the path is: (4,5) <- (5,5) <- (6,5) <- (6,6) <- (5,6). Since head direction is L, it was moving left to (4,5), so previous position was (5,5), which makes sense.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 7. Since current turn is 13, it disappears at turn 13 + 7 = 20? Life span is given as 7, and it decreases each turn including current, so after 7 turns it's gone. So at turn 13, life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 more turns, so at turn 20 it's gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Food life-span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L. For example, at turn t, countdown is L; after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So for (3,1), life span 7 at turn 13, so it will be there until turn 19, and disappear at turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) has life span 10, so disappears at turn 13 + 10 = 23.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. I have to choose an action sequence starting from turn 13.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R. But head direction is L, so I cannot instantly reverse to R. So from (4,5), moving L would go to (3,5), D to (4,4), U to (4,6), but U and D might be possible, and L is possible since it's not reverse? Reverse would be opposite, so since current direction is L, opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn. So allowed moves are L, U, D.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5)\n> \n> - Move L: to (3,5)\n> \n> - Move U: to (4,6)\n> \n> - Move D: to (4,4)\n> \n> Move R is not allowed because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to see what's at these positions.\n> \n> First, (3,5) has food! Food is at (3,5) with value +1, life span 10.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> (4,4): is this a wall or something? Walls are at borders and internal obstacle.\n> \n> Borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so (4,4) is within 1 to 6? x=4, y=4, min x=0, max x=7, so x=4 is between 1 and 6? 0 to 7 inclusive, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) but walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So for a cell to be free, it must have 1 <= x <=6 and 1 <= y <=6, and not be (6,4).\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - x from 1 to 6 inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free? Similarly y=1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0, x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are non-wall, but walls are cells, so the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (6,4) is also a wall.\n> \n> So free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4).\n> \n> (4,4): x=4, y=4, which is within 1-6, and not (6,4), so it's free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So (4,4) is not occupied by snake, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): x=4,y=6, y=6 is not y=7, y=7 is wall, y=6 is within 1-6? y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6 except (6,4).\n> \n> So (4,6): x=4,y=6, which is free and not snake, so possible.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3,y=5, free, not snake, and has food.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (3,5), I eat the food since head moves onto it, and it's positive food, so snake length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6).\n> \n> So tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,5), tail at (5,6). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,5) and (5,6): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent is same row or column, differing by 1 in one coordinate.\n> \n> So (4,5) and (5,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (4,5) to (3,5) left, (5,5) right, (4,4) down, (4,6) up. (5,5) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (5,6), which is not adjacent to (4,5). From (4,5) to (5,6): it's not directly adjacent; to reach (5,6) from (4,5), you need to move right then up or up then right, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail. Therefore, no tail reward danger for eating food at (3,5).\n> \n> Moreover, the food is not under the snake body; it's at (3,5), which is free.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) seems safe and gives immediate reward.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead, and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there's another food at (3,1), which is farther, with life span 7, so I have time.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will grow when it eats food.\n> \n> If I eat food at (3,5) on turn 13, then on turn 13, head moves to (3,5), eats food, so new head position, and the tail doesn't move because it grows, so snake becomes: new head (3,5), then previous head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and since it ate, tail stays, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] with 6 segments.\n> \n> Then on next turn, tail moves away.\n> \n> But now, I need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions and consequences.\n> \n> Current turn 13, head at (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (3,5): eat food, grow to length 6, head now at (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> - U to (4,6): no food, head to (4,6), direction U.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): no food, head to (4,4), direction D.\n> \n> Now, I should consider the future.\n> \n> Also, the food at (3,1) is at y=1, which is close to wall y=0, but y=1 is free.\n> \n> Life span 7, so I have until turn 20 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) has life span 10, until turn 23.\n> \n> But if I eat (3,5) now, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6).\n> \n> So the snake is like: head (4,5), body to the right and down, forming a sort of L shape.\n> \n> (5,6) is tail.\n> \n> After moving, if I go to (3,5), I eat food, grow, head at (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6).\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), I can move: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, so collision, cannot.

So new positions: head (3,4), then segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and (6,6) is now the tail?

It's turn 14. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). Snake positions are: head at (3,5), then body segments at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), and tail at (5,6). Head direction is left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food is at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 6. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, after turn 14, it will have 5 turns left, then 4, and so on, until it disappears.\n> \n> My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so yes, 8x8 grid.\n> \n> - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all borders. Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> - Snake: positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So let's plot this:\n> \n> - Row y=5: cells (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) are occupied by snake.\n> \n> - Then (6,6) and (5,6) are also snake. So the snake is like: from (3,5) left to (6,5), then up to (6,6), then left to (5,6). Head is at (3,5), moving left. Last move was left, so from (4,5) to (3,5)? Positions are listed head first: [(3,5), (4,5), ...], so head is at (3,5), which was just moved to from (4,5) since direction is L.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: L\", meaning the direction the head is facing now, so it's at (3,5) and facing left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head position (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6)\n> \n> - Down: (3,4)\n> \n> - Left: (2,5)\n> \n> - Right: (4,5)\n> \n> But right is (4,5), which is the second segment of the snake. However, since the snake moves, when I move, the tail will move away, so moving to a cell that is currently occupied might be possible if it's the tail and it moves.\n> \n> Collision rules: I die if head touches any body segment except that I can move into the tail cell because the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (5,6). Let's list the snake segments:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (5,6) tail\n> \n> So (4,5) is the neck, not tail. If I move right to (4,5), that is occupied by the body, so it would be a collision and I die.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (2,5) might be safe if not wall or body.\n> \n> Moving up to (3,6) or down to (3,4).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (2,5) is within bounds, x=2 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), which might be relevant later.\n> \n> Now, food is at (3,1) with value +1, life span 6. Since current turn is 14, it will disappear after N turns, so life span 6 means it has 6 turns including this one? Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (3,1), life_span=6 at turn 14. So on turn 14, countdown=6, after turn 14, it decreases to 5, then 4,3,2,1,0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, I think. \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so if life_span=N, it disappears after N turns, so it exists for N turns including current.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only this turn.\n> \n> Here N=6, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 14: countdown=6\n> \n> - Turn 15: countdown=5\n> \n> - Turn 16: countdown=4\n> \n> - Turn 17: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 18: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 19: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 20: countdown=0 → disappears? But \"disappears after N turns\" – N=6, so after 6 turns from now, meaning after turn 19? Turn 14 + 6 = turn 20, but let's see the countdown.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases each turn including current, then at turn t, if life_span=L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, L=1: present only on turn t, disappears at turn t+1.\n> \n> L=2: present on turn t and t+1, disappears at turn t+2.\n> \n> Here L=6, turn t=14, so food present on turns 14,15,16,17,18,19. Disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> But we can eat it as long as it's present, so up to turn 19.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (3,1), and snake head at (3,5), so same x, different y, distance |5-1|=4 in y-direction.\n> \n> I need to get to (3,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles, and I need to avoid dying.\n> \n> Also, only one food given, so I should consider eating it.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's find safe moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4)\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by snake body (index 1), so if I move there, head collides with body, die. So R is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, opposite is R, which is invalid anyway, but for other moves.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R, which is already invalid.\n> \n> For next turns, I need to remember the head direction after each move.\n> \n> Now, let's check each possible move:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6). Is (3,6) safe? Not wall: x=3 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is not (3,6). Snake body: positions are (4,5),(5,5),(6,5),(6,6),(5,6). (3,6) is not in this list, so empty? But after move, the snake will move, so we need to see if after moving head to (3,6), the tail moves, so the cell (5,6) is freed, but (3,6) was empty, so should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, D: to (3,4). (3,4): not wall, not obstacle (6,4) is different), and not snake body? Snake is at (3,5),(4,5),etc, (3,4) not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> L: to (2,5). (2,5): not wall, not obstacle, not snake body, so safe.\n> \n> R: to (4,5) but occupied by body, deadly, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (3,1).\n> \n> Food is at (3,1), head at (3,5), so vertically down.\n> \n> But there might be walls or obstacles in between? No, the grid is open except borders and (6,4), which is not on this column.\n> \n> Column x=3, y from 5 to 1: y=5,4,3,2,1. All should be free except possibly snake.\n> \n> But snake is only at (3,5), which is the head, and when we move, it leaves.\n> \n> To go down to (3,1), I need to move down multiple times.\n> \n> But I need to avoid colliding with myself or walls.\n> \n> Also, the snake body might block the way.\n> \n> Current snake positions: from (3,5) to (5,6).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4), then head to (3,4), body follows: new head (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes neck, then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), and tail (5,6) moves to where? When head moves to (3,4), the tail moves forward, so the segment at (5,6) will move to the next position, but since it's the tail, and the snake moves, the tail segment moves to where the previous segment was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to new position, the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, and so on, tail moves to where the last body segment was.\n> \n> In this case, if I move down to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was index 1, (4,5)) moves to where head was, (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (index 2, (5,5)) moves to where segment 1 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (index 3, (6,5)) moves to where segment 2 was, (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (index 4, (6,6)) moves to where segment 3 was, (6,5)? Segment 3 was at (6,5), so segment 4 moves to (6,5)? But segment 3 moves to (5,5), so segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was before move, which is (6,5).\n> \n> Let's list positions after move:\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 1 moves to old head position (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (tail, index 5) moves to old segment 4 position (6,6)\n> \n> Old segment 4 was at (6,6), so tail moves to (6,6).\n> \n> After move down to (3,4):\n> \n> New snake: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,6)?

Also, internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> - Snake positions:\n> - Head: (3,4)\n> - Body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)  // Since head is first, and it's moving down, the tail is at (6,6).\n> \n> Head direction is D (down), so from (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, y=0 might be bottom or top; I need to assume a coordinate system. Since head is at (3,4) and direction down, and body is at (3,5), which has higher y, so if down decreases y, then y=0 is bottom? Let's see:\n> \n> - (3,4) to (3,5): if head was moving down to (3,4), but previous position must be above. Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5), which is above if y increases upwards? I think there's confusion.\n> \n> In the list: positions are [(3,4), (3,5), ...], and head direction is D (down). So if head is at (3,4) and moving down, down should decrease y if we consider y=0 at bottom. But (3,5) has y=5, which is greater than y=4, so if y increases upwards, then (3,5) is north of (3,4). But head is moving down to (3,4), so from where? Previous head position must be (3,5), I think.\n> \n> Let's read the positions: the list is head first, so at turn 15, head is at (3,4), and the segment behind it is (3,5), which means the snake was previously at (3,5) and moved down to (3,4)? But direction is given as D, which is current direction.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, meaning it is currently facing down, so from (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3).\n> \n> But the body includes (3,5), which is directly above (3,4) if y=5 is north, so yes, snake is moving south/down.\n> \n> So coordinate system: let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so increasing y is north, decreasing y is south (down).\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 west, x=7 east.\n> \n> So head at (3,4), moving down to decrease y.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately, but I can move L, R, or continue D.\n> \n> Movement constraints: in each turn, I can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move up next. I can move down, left, or right.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from head position (3,4):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,3) – is this valid? Check collisions.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Up (U): but cannot, because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,3): x=3 not border, y=3 not border, so ok. (2,4): x=2>0, y=4<7, not border. (4,4): similar. Also, internal obstacle at (6,4), but we're not near that yet.\n> \n> Now, body collision: snake body positions are (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6). Head at (3,4), moving to (3,3): (3,3) is not in body, so ok. Similarly, (2,4) not in body, (4,4) not in body. So all three moves are safe immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns, especially to eat the food at (3,1) if possible.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) with value +1, life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, so by turn 20. Current turn 15, so it has 5 turns left, including turn 15? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 15, life span=5, so it will be there for turns 15,16,17,18,19, and disappear at turn 20. So I have until turn 19 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (3,1), and head is at (3,4). So vertically aligned, but head is at y=4, food at y=1, so I need to move down to reach it.\n> \n> Distance: from (3,4) to (3,1) is 3 steps down (to y=3,2,1).\n> \n> But I need to get there safely, considering the body and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, note the tail: tail is at (6,6), and when I eat food, snake grows, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> First, let's plan a path to the food.\n> \n> From (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1) to eat on turn 17 or something.\n> \n> But let's count turns.\n> \n> Current turn 15: head at (3,4)\n> \n> If I move down to (3,3) on turn 15.\n> \n> Then turn 16: from (3,3), I can move down to (3,2)\n> \n> Then turn 17: from (3,2) to (3,1) and eat.\n> \n> But on eating, the snake grows, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Currently, snake has 6 segments: positions list has 6 elements, so length 6.\n> \n> After eating, length 7.\n> \n> But I need to ensure that after eating, I don't collide.\n> \n> Also, the food at (3,1) might be under the body? Let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6). None of these is (3,1), so food is free, not under snake.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but in this case, it's not.\n> \n> Now, when I move to (3,1) on turn 17, I eat it, head moves there, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail moves, the new segment is added after the tail moves? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move that turn; the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of movement, when head moves to a new cell, if it's food, it eats, and tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Otherwise, head moves, tail moves, length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat on turn 17, at (3,1), then on that turn, head moves to (3,1), tail remains at (6,6) for that turn? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically: at each turn, head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, then the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And \"Snake Positions\" update accordingly.\n> \n> Also, for negative food, length unchanged.\n> \n> Here, only positive food.\n> \n> So, if I move to a food cell, head goes there, and tail does not move, so positions: new head at food, and the previous positions all shift, but the last segment (tail) stays, so a new segment is added.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H(3,4), B1(3,5), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), T(6,6)\n> \n> If I move down to (3,3) and no food, then new positions: H(3,3), B1(3,4), B2(3,5), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), T(6,5) — tail moved from (6,6) to (6,5)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, all body segments move one step forward to the previous position.\n> \n> So positions list: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to empty cell: new head at new position, B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., T at old second last.\n> \n> So in this case, from [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n> \n> Move down to (3,3): new head (3,3), then B1 at old head (3,4), B2 at old B1 (3,5), B3 at old B2 (4,5), B4 at old B3 (5,5), T at old B4 (6,5). Old T (6,6) is left, so tail moved to (6,5).\n> \n> But (6,6) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> Now, if I move to a food cell, say at (3,3) if food was there, but not, so no growth.\n> \n> For eating at (3,1).\n> \n> Suppose on turn 17, head moves to (3,1) which has food.\n> \n> Then, head moves to (3,1), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: H(3,1), then B1 at old H position, which was (3,2) if I was at (3,2) before, but let's sequence.\n> \n> First, I need to get to (3,1).\n> \n> Path: from (3,4) on turn 15, move D to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 15: move D to (3,3). New positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — tail at (6,5), since (6,6) moved to (6,5).\n> \n> List: old positions: index 0: (3,4), 1:(3,5), 2:(4,5), 3:(5,5), 4:(6,5), 5:(6,6)\n> \n> After move to (3,3): new head (3,3), then segment 1 at old head (3,4), segment 2 at old seg1 (3,5), segment 3 at old seg2 (4,5), segment 4 at old seg3 (5,5), segment 5 (tail) at old seg4 (6,5).

Positions have 6 elements, so indices 0 to 5.\n> \n> After move: new head (3,2), then position 1: old head (3,3), position 2: old pos1 (3,4), position 3: old pos2 (3,5), position 4: old pos3 (4,5), position 5: old pos4 (5,5). Old pos5 (6,5) is gone, so tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> But (6,5) is no longer occupied.\n> \n> Now turn 17: from (3,2), move D to (3,1) which has food. So eat, head moves to (3,1), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the current tail position.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ]  // tail at (5,5)\n> \n> Move head to (3,1) with food: new head (3,1), then the body segments move to previous positions, but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,1), then B1 at old head (3,2), B2 at old B1 (3,3), B3 at old B2 (3,4), B4 at old B3 (3,5), B5 at old B4 (4,5), and new tail at old tail (5,5).

So (3,2) is not occupied by body, so moving D to (3,2) should be safe, as long as no other issues.\n> \n> When moving, the tail will move, so only collisions with walls or body except the tail are deadly.

When head moves to (3,2), the snake grows only if it eats food, but no food at (3,2), so length unchanged, tail moves away from (6,5), so new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Tail (6,5) is removed, so body segments: (3,3) to (5,5), but (6,5) was tail, now removed, so snake is now at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).

New head at (3,1), body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and since ate, add new segment at the previous tail position, which was (5,5), so now tail is at (5,5), but (5,5) is now part of body, and new segment at (5,5)? No: when eating, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving. So before moving to (3,1), tail is at (5,5). After moving to (3,1), the tail stays, and a new segment is added there, so positions become: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and new segment at (5,5)? That can't be, (5,5) is already occupied.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when the head moves to a food cell, the snake grows by one segment. So the tail does not move that turn. So positions: new head at food cell, the previous head becomes the first body segment, and all body segments shift, but the tail remains in place, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before eating, positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After moving to food: new positions [new_head (food cell), head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail] and tail position is duplicated for that turn, but since tail didn't move, it stays, so the new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> For example: before move: positions A, B, C, D, E with E tail.\n> \n> Move head to F (food), then new positions: F, A, B, C, D, E. E is still tail, but since growth, E is now followed by a new segment? No, the length increases, so positions become F, A, B, C, D, E, and E is the last, but since tail didn't move, it stays, so E is now the second last, and a new segment is at E? I think it's better to think that the tail position remains, so for one turn, the tail is stationary.\n> \n> In list terms: after moving to food, the new position list is [new_head] + previous list, so the tail remains the same cell as before.\n> \n> For our case: after turn 16 move to (3,2): positions [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Now turn 17, move D to (3,1): (3,1) has food, so eat it. New positions: head (3,1), then previous positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — so now 7 segments: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> And the food at (3,1) is consumed.\n> \n> Then, on subsequent moves, the tail will move when no food eaten.\n> \n> But is (3,1) safe? (3,1) is not a wall, y=1>0, x=3, fine.

So cells go from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> **Snake Positions**: Head is at (2,2), then body segments: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Left (L), meaning it was moving left to (2,2) from (3,2), I think? Positions are listed as [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)], so head at (2,2), next segment at (3,2), which is to the right, so since head direction is L, it must have moved left to (2,2) from (3,2). But (3,2) is still part of the body. Current head is at (2,2), and it's facing left, so from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2), but let's confirm the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, so the snake is currently facing left. That means from (2,2), possible moves are left to (1,2), but since it can't reverse instantly, it can't go right back to (3,2). Also, it can move up or down, but not opposite direction.\n> \n> **Movement constraints**: Since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. So possible actions from (2,2) with direction L: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, let's list the food:\n> \n> - Food at (3,1) with value 1, life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Current turn is 18, so at turn 18, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Food life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (3,1), life span 2 at turn 18. That means:\n> \n> - Turn 18: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 19: if not eaten, life span decreases to 1? Or after turn 18, it becomes 1, and so on.\n> \n> The description says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn, life span is given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it will be gone. But also \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for example, if life_span is 2 at turn t, then:\n> \n> - During turn t: countdown is 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes 1\n> \n> - During turn t+1: countdown is 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown becomes 0, disappears\n> \n> - So at turn t+2, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span 8 at (3,6), it will last until turn 18+8-1=25? Let's not assume, I'll keep track.\n> \n> For (3,1): life_span 2 at turn 18. So:\n> \n> - Turn 18: available\n> \n> - Turn 19: available\n> \n> - After turn 19, it disappears, so not available on turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): life_span 8 at turn 18, so available until turn 18+8-1=25? Since countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L, it will be available for L more turns, including turn t. So from turn t to turn t+L-1, it is available, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (3,1): L=2 at t=18, so available on turn 18 and 19, gone on turn 20.\n> \n> For (3,6): L=8 at t=18, so available from turn 18 to 25, gone on turn 26.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (2,2), body segments: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> The food is at (3,1) and (3,6).\n> \n> (3,1) is above the body segment at (3,2), since (3,2) is y=2, (3,1) is y=1, so directly above (3,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is below (3,5), since (3,5) is at y=5, (3,6) at y=6.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) has a short life span, only 2 turns, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But to eat (3,1), which is at (3,1), and currently occupied by body? Snake positions include (3,2), but not (3,1), so (3,1) is not under the snake, it's empty, I think.\n> \n> Food can spawn under snake body, but in this case, (3,1) is not listed in snake positions, so it's not under the snake. Similarly, (3,6) is not in snake positions. Snake has (3,5) and (4,5), but (3,6) is free.\n> \n> So both food are on empty cells.\n> \n> (3,1) is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,2), the first body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), adjacent to (3,5), the fourth body segment? Positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So (3,5) is the fifth segment, I think indices: 0:head(2,2), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,3), 3:(3,4), 4:(3,5), 5:(4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (3,5) is a body segment, and (3,6) is directly below it.\n> \n> Now, to eat (3,1), I need to move the head to (3,1). But (3,1) is above (3,2), and since the snake is at (2,2), I need to get to (3,1).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2) with direction L: I can go L to (1,2), U to (2,3), or D to (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is down, since y decreases down? In grid coordinates, typically y=0 is bottom or top? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7, but not specified which is top or bottom. In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might mean y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, or vice versa. In standard coordinates, often y=0 is top, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing upwards or downwards.\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. Internal obstacle (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Head at (2,2), which is left of (3,2), so x=2 is left, x=3 is right, so x increases right. y: from (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), so y=2 to y=3 to y=4 to y=5, and U is (x,y+1), so if moving from (3,2) to (3,3) is U? But head direction was not given for past, current head direction is L at (2,2).\n> \n> From the positions, the snake was moving: before (2,2), head was at (3,2) at previous turn, I assume, since positions are in order. At turn 17, head was at (3,2), then moved left to (2,2) at turn 18, so direction L.\n> \n> Now, from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (1,2)\n> \n> - U: to (2,3)  // y+1\n> \n> - D: to (2,1)  // y-1\n> \n> Cannot go R to (3,2) because reverse.\n> \n> Now, (2,1): is that within bounds? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So x from 1 to 6 are safe? Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6) as free, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (6,4).\n> \n> (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, y=1 is not border? Border is y=0, so y=1 is not a wall cell, it should be free. Similarly, (1,2) x=1,y=2, x=1 is not 0 or 7, so free. (2,3) similarly free.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1) and (3,6).\n> \n> (3,1): x=3,y=1, which is on the bottom row if y=0 is bottom, but y=1 is free since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): x=3,y=6, y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall.\n> \n> y=6 is adjacent to y=7 wall, but not wall itself.\n> \n> Now, to eat (3,1), which is at (3,1). From current position (2,2), I can move down to (2,1), but (2,1) is not (3,1). Then from (2,1), I need to go right to (3,1), but let's see the path.\n> \n> Since (3,1) has short life span, only available for turns 18 and 19, I need to eat it by turn 19.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) has longer life, up to turn 25.\n> \n> But I should think about risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards (3,1).\n> \n> From (2,2), if I move D to (2,1), then at (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) to eat it on the next turn.\n> \n> But let's see if that causes collision or not.\n> \n> After moving, the snake grows when it eats food, so if I eat on turn, say, 19, the snake grows.\n> \n> Also, need to check if eating (3,1) is safe. (3,1) is adjacent to the body segment at (3,2). But when I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Food mechanics: when head moves onto food, it eats it, length increases by 1 for positive food, tail stays put that turn.\n> \n> But \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, (3,1) is not on the tail; tail is at (4,5). So no issue.\n> \n> (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2), which is a body segment, but not the tail.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,1) when it's free, I can eat it safely.\n> \n> Now, from current position (2,2), if I move D to (2,1) on turn 18.\n> \n> Then on turn 19, from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> But when I move to (3,1), the head is at (3,1), and the body is: previous head was (2,1), but after moving to (3,1), the body segments are: the new head is (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) becomes part of body, and the rest: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head was at (2,1) at turn 19 start, then moves to (3,1), so new head (3,1), then body: (2,1), and then previous body: which was from (2,2) to ... but at turn 18, after moving to (2,1), positions are: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) — no, let's think step by step.\n> \n> At turn 18 start: snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Head direction: L\n> \n> I choose action for turn 18, say D to (2,1).\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), new positions: head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) is now second segment, so positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]? No, when moving, the tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten at (2,1), I assume? (2,1) is not a food position, so no food eaten, so the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So at turn 18, start positions: S = [H(2,2), B1(3,2), B2(3,3), B3(3,4), B4(3,5), T(4,5)]\n> \n> I move head to (2,1) with action D.\n> \n> New head: (2,1)\n> \n> Then B1 moves to previous H position (2,2)\n> \n> B2 moves to previous B1 position (3,2)\n> \n> B3 moves to previous B2 position (3,3)\n> \n> B4 moves to previous B3 position (3,4)\n> \n> T moves to previous B4 position (3,5)\n> \n> And tail (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), which was previously B4.\n> \n> Now, on turn 19, I can move from (2,1) to (3,1) with action R (right).\n> \n> (3,1) has food, positive, so when I move to (3,1), I eat the food.\n> \n> New head: (3,1)\n> \n> Since food eaten, the tail does not move, so body segments remain: (2,1) becomes new body, and previous body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Length increased by one.\n> \n> Now, is there any collision? Head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2), which is a body segment, so when head moves to (3,1), it is next to (3,2), but since (3,2) is not the new tail, and head is at (3,1), it should be fine as long as it doesn't collide.\n> \n> Collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, but tail can be occupied if it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, at (3,1), the cells around: (3,2) is occupied by body, but head is at (3,1), which is different cell, so no collision unless head moves into a body cell.\n> \n> When moving to (3,1), if (3,1) was occupied, but it's not, it's food, so after eating, the body is at (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc., so (3,1) is head, and (3,2) is body, but they are adjacent, not same cell, so no collision.\n> \n> So eating (3,1) on turn 19 seems safe.\n> \n> But (3,1) life span: at turn 18, life span 2, so on turn 19 it is still available? Turn 18: life span 2, after turn 18, it decreases to 1, so on turn 19, life span 1, available.

From (2,2), I can go R, but I cannot, because direction is L, cannot reverse to R.

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) being bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but I should confirm. The walls are described as border cells, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are the boundaries. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), then body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is 6 segments long.

In standard coordinates, y often increases downwards, but let's see the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So, if y increases upwards, U would be up, D down. But typically in grids, y=0 is top, so U (y+1) might go down if y increases down. I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The food positions are given with (x,y), and walls at y=0 and y=7. Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), etc. Since head is at (2,1) and moving down (D), which is (x,y-1), so if D is (x,y-1), that means y decreases when moving down, so y=0 is top and y=7 is bottom? Let's see: D is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y, meaning higher y values are lower on the grid. For example, from (2,1) to (2,2) would be moving down if y increases downwards? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Standard: In many grid systems, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downwards, so U (up) is (x, y-1), D (down) is (x, y+1). But here, U is defined as (x,y+1), which suggests y increases upwards? That might be the case.\n> \n> Look at the movement constraints: U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`. So U: y+1, which could be north if y increases north, but usually in grids, we think of y increasing south. To avoid confusion, I should think in terms of coordinates.\n> \n> Given the walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom or top? The state says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" It doesn't specify, but since D is (x,y-1), let's assume that y=0 is the bottom, so moving down decreases y towards 0. But if y=0 is bottom, moving down should increase y? I'm messing this up.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that (0,0) is bottom-left. So y increases upwards, x increases right. Then U (up) would be (x,y+1), D (down) would be (x,y-1), which makes sense because down decreases y.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row? But y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so U (y+1) moves towards higher y, which is up, towards y=7.\n> \n> But let's check the snake positions: snake is at (2,1), (2,2), etc. If y=0 is bottom, (2,1) is above bottom, (2,2) higher, so if head is at (2,1) moving down to (2,0)? But y=0 is wall, so it can't move there. Head direction is D, down, so from (2,1), if it moves down, it would go to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so that would be collision. But the snake is currently at (2,1) with direction D, so it must have come from above or something. Positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. Head at (2,1), next segment at (2,2), so if head is at (2,1) and body at (2,2), that means the snake was moving down from (2,2) to (2,1), so direction D is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> So, with head at (2,1) and direction D, it was moving to (2,1) from (2,2), so previous position was (2,2), moving to (2,1), so decreasing y. Therefore, y=0 is the bottom, y increases as we go up. So (2,1) is at y=1, (2,2) at y=2, so moving from (2,2) to (2,1) is down, decreasing y. U (up) would increase y to (2,3), for example.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So coordinate system: (0,0) bottom-left, x right, y up. So U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 (left), x=7 (right), y=0 (bottom), y=7 (top). Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 7\n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: (3,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". Current turn is 19, so for food at (3,1), life span 1, so after this turn (turn 19), countdown to 0, and it disappears. \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns from now, meaning it can be eaten for L more turns including current.\n> \n> For food with life span N at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N. Countdown decreases each turn, starting from N at turn t, to N-1 at t+1, ..., 0 at t+N, then disappears.\n> \n> For (3,1): life span 1 at turn 19, so countdown is 1, meaning it can be eaten only on turn 19 (current turn), and disappears after turn 19, so not available next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): life span 7, so available from turn 19 to 25, disappears at turn 26.\n> \n> (1,4): life span 10, available turn 19 to 28.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,1), direction D (down). So current position (2,1), moving down would be to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so it cannot move down; that would be wall collision. Therefore, from current position (2,1), possible moves are not all, since it cannot go down to wall.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is D, so cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so next move cannot be U, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1): U, D, L, R, but D to (2,0) is wall, so invalid. L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U to (2,2).\n> \n> But U to (2,2): (2,2) is the second segment of the snake, but is it occupied? Snake positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), etc. So (2,2) is the body segment immediately behind head. If the snake moves up to (2,2), that would be moving into its own body, which is a collision? But according to rules, it can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and the tail moves, it might be ok, but let's see.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but moving to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail is collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,1), moving to (2,2): (2,2) is currently occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). The snake has positions: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So (2,2) is segment 1, which is not the tail. If head moves to (2,2), it would be on the same cell as segment 1 before movement, but after movement, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it depends: if that segment is the tail, and it moves away, it's ok; but if it's not the tail, then after movement, the head would be where that segment was, but that segment moves to another position, so if the head moves to a non-tail body cell, it collides because that cell is occupied and not vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: before move, the cells are occupied. After move, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, then after movement, that segment has moved to a new position, but the head is now on a cell that was just occupied, but since the segment moved, the cell is empty, but during the move, when head enters, it might be considered collision if it's not the tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" – I think it's about the position after movement or during? But typically, collision is checked when the head moves to a new cell; if that cell has a wall or a body segment, it dies.\n> \n> But with the exception: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so the head doesn't collide.\n> \n> But moving to any other body segment cell causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,2): (2,2) is occupied by segment 1, which is not tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving to (2,2) would be collision with body.\n> \n> - D to (2,0): y=0, wall, collision.\n> \n> - L to (1,1): what is at (1,1)? Not occupied by snake or wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders: x=0,7; y=0,7. Internal: (6,4). So (1,1) is within bounds, no wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So (1,1) is empty.\n> \n> - R to (3,1): (3,1) has food? Food at (3,1), but is it occupied? Currently, snake is not at (3,1), positions are (2,1), etc., so (3,1) is free, but has food.\n> \n> Also, (3,1) is not a body segment? Let's see.\n> \n> First, from (2,1):\n> \n> - U: (2,2) - occupied by segment 1, not tail, so collision if moved there.\n> \n> - D: (2,0) - wall, collision.\n> \n> - L: (1,1) - empty, no wall, safe.\n> \n> - R: (3,1) - has food, and is empty? Snake not there, so safe to move, and eat food.\n> \n> (3,1) has food, but moving to (3,1) would eat the food since head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\" Here, (3,1) is not under snake body; it's free, so moving there should eat it.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,5), head at (2,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible actions: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> R to (3,1) would eat the food at (3,1), which has life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or gone.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because it's reverse? Current direction is D, moving down, so from (2,1), previous was (2,2), moving down to (2,1), so direction is D. Next move, cannot move U because opposite direction? No instant reverse: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so cannot move U next.\n> \n> But U is to (2,2), which is also occupied, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only L or R possible.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (3,1), I eat the food, snake grows to length 7, new tail is added, so positions become: head to (3,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes segment, so new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] and since ate food, length increases, so tail stays at (3,5), and a new segment is added where? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position before movement or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it doesn't move the tail that turn, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake at S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head at new position, B1 moves to H old, B2 to B1 old, ..., T moves to T-1 old, and T old position vacated.\n> \n> After eating: new head at food position, B1 to H old, ..., T stays in place, and a new segment is added at T position, so T doesn't move, and new tail is added.\n> \n> In terms of positions: let’s say positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P5 (tail).\n> \n> After move to new head position N:\n> \n> - If no eat: new positions: N, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 (P5 vacated)\n> \n> - If eat: new positions: N, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (so P5 stays, new segment, tail is P5)\n> \n> In this case, before: positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> If move R to (3,1) and eat food: new head (3,1), then (2,1) becomes segment 1, (2,2) segment 2, etc., and (3,5) stays, so new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] length 7.\n> \n> If no eat, move to empty cell, say (1,1), then new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) vacated, tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 19, I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) to eat food.\n> \n> But (3,1) food disappears after this turn, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> But is it safe? Moving to (3,1) seems fine, no immediate collision.\n> \n> But let's think ahead.\n> \n> First, if I eat at (3,1), snake grows to 7, head at (3,1), direction was to right, so new direction R.\n> \n> Then next turn, possible moves from (3,1): U to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied?

It's turn 21, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 6. So it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 21, life span 6 means it will be gone by turn 27 if not eaten? Let's see: life span N, decreases each turn, so if not eaten, it lasts N turns. At turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? The problem says: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 6 at turn 21, after turn 21, life span becomes 5, then 4, ..., until 0, and it disappears when life span reaches 0. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 26 (since at turn 27, if life span was 6 at turn 21, after 6 decreases, it's gone). Turn 21: life span 6, after turn 21, it decreases to 5 (end of turn 21? Or during turn? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, at the start of turn, we check food, and after the snake moves, if head is on food, it's eaten. Life span decreases at the end of each turn.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the beginning of each turn, the life span is current, and after the snake moves, if head eats food, it's consumed, then at end of turn, life span decreases for all food.\n> \n> For simplicity, since the action is chosen for turn t, and food is present if life span >0 at start of turn.\n> \n> But let's not overcomplicate; for this food, life span 6 at turn 21, so it has 6 turns left including turn 21, so it will be available until turn 26 (after 6 turns from 21 to 26), disappearing at turn 27.\n> \n> Similarly, other food at (1,4) with value 1, life span 8, so available until turn 28.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,2), direction U.

It's turn 22. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid since coordinates go from 0 to 7 inclusive. There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,3), then body segments at (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (1,3) from below, so previous move was Up.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this one. Since it's turn 22, it will disappear after turn 26? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is 5 at turn 22, it will be gone by turn 27? Let me calculate: at turn 22, life span 5, so after turn 22, it decreases to 4, then to 3 at turn 23, and so on, until turn 26 it has life span 1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn 27. Similarly, food at (1,4) has life span 7, so available until turn 28? Turn 22: life span 7, turn 23:6, ..., turn 28:1, gone on turn 29. And (6,2) with life span 10, available until turn 31.\n> \n> But I need to think about when to eat them.\n> \n> Now, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. All food here has value +1, so all are positive. No negative food mentioned, so I can eat any.\n> \n> But I have to avoid collisions: with walls, obstacles, or my own body. Also, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the tail grows and collides.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

But there is food at (1,4), but let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> First, (1,4) has food, but moving there would eat it.\n> \n> But is (1,4) occupied?

So (1,4) is free, and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (2,3): (2,3) is not in snake positions, and not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food at (1,4) is very close, life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But let's list all food:\n> \n> - (3,6): value 1, life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 26 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 7, by turn 28.\n> \n> - (6,2): value 1, life span 10, by turn 31.\n> \n> Since the snake is at (1,3), (1,4) is adjacent and has food.

No, when you eat, the snake grows, so after moving to (1,4), head is at (1,4), and since I ate food, the tail stays, so new tail is still (3,2)? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, tail moves away from last position. When eating, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move U to (1,4), I eat the food, so head is now (1,4), and the body: previous head (1,3) becomes body, so snake becomes: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] with length 7.\n> \n> Tail is still (3,2).\n> \n> Now, is there any danger?

After move, positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Tail was (3,2), but since no eat, tail moves off, so the new tail is (2,2)?

Then the body: the first segment after head was (1,3), which is now the neck, but all segments shift: so the segment at index 1, (1,2), becomes the new position for what was index 0? Better to think: the head moves to (2,3), and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So after move R:\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Then segment that was head: (1,3) now at position 1\n> \n> - Then (1,2) at position 2\n> \n> - Then (1,1) at position 3\n> \n> - Then (2,1) at position 4\n> \n> - Then (2,2) at position 5\n> \n> - And tail (3,2) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Tail is (2,2).\n> \n> Length still 6.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> But I should consider the food at (1,4) which is nearby.\n> \n> If I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or I might miss it.\n> \n> But life span is 7, so I have time.\n> \n> Now, the other food: (3,6) and (6,2).\n> \n> (3,6) is at y=6, x=3, which is not too far.\n> \n> (6,2) is near the obstacle.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid the obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Obstacle: (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: head (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the left, with a bend.\n> \n> From head (1,3), it can go U to (1,4) or R to (2,3) or D but D not allowed, L to (0,3) wall.\n> \n> So only U or R for turn 22.\n> \n> Case 1: Go U to (1,4) at turn 22.\n> \n> Then I eat the food at (1,4), so score +1, snake grows to 7 segments: positions [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> Head at (1,4), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Now, for turn 23, possible moves: from (1,4), I can go U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since I just moved U, I cannot move D (down) next.\n> \n> Also, L to (0,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> R to (2,4)?

It's turn 23, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me check.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). But there's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake is 7 segments long.

Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the current situation.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> So available cells: (1,1) to (6,6) minus (6,4).\n> \n> But (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, that's 6x6 grid, 36 cells.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, yes.\n> \n> But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is invalid, and also (6,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> Food at (3,6) and (6,2)\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so last move was Up to (1,4) from (1,3)? Positions: snake is [(1,4), (1,3), ...] so head at (1,4), which it moved to from (1,3) since direction is Up. So previous head position was (1,3), and it moved Up to (1,4).\n> \n> Since direction is Up, I cannot move Down on the next turn because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (1,4) are Up, Left, Right. But let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> Current position: (1,4)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (1,5)\n> \n> - Down: but Down is opposite to current direction (Up), so cannot move Down.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,4) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,4)\n> \n> So only possible moves are Up or Right. Down is invalid because reverse, Left is invalid because wall.\n> \n> Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,6) and (6,2).\n> \n> (3,6) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 23, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 26? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, including current turn. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, life span becomes N-1.

I think it disappears when life span reaches 0, so at the end of turn 26 or beginning of turn 27. But for planning, we can say it is available until turn 26 inclusive, I suppose.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 9, so it will be around for a while.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns, but probably more to show thinking ahead.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence starting from turn 23, for several turns, and a conclusion.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate moves.\n> \n> From (1,4), I can go Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, what is at (1,5)?

Only Left or Right, but Left to (0,6) wall, invalid, so only Right to (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if I go Right from (1,5) to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but direction would be Right, so cannot move Left.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,6) is close, but life span 4, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> Turn 23: if I go Up to (1,5), then turn 24: from (1,5) I can go Up to (1,6), then turn 25: from (1,6) only Right to (2,6), turn 26: from (2,6) I can go Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6) or Up to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, so Down or Right.\n> \n> (2,6) to (3,6) is Right, which would eat the food if it's still there.\n> \n> But life span: at turn 23, food life 4, after turn 23: life 3, after turn 24: life 2, after turn 25: life 1, after turn 26: life 0, disappears.

Let's see the positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), which is left of head, so it was moving right to (2,5) from (1,5).

Eat (3,6) and (6,2) is difficult because after eating (3,6), I'm at (3,6), and (6,2) is far, 3 right and 4 down, 7 moves, but only 5 turns to turn 31, not enough.\n> \n> So only options are to eat

Head direction is Up, meaning it's moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value +1, life span 5 (so it disappears after 5 turns, including this one, so by turn 31 it might be gone if not eaten)\n> \n> - (5,6) with value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 34)\n> \n> Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 27. The actions should be for turns 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, etc. Since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan for 5 or 6 turns to be safe.\n> \n> Key constraints:\n> \n> - Cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is Up, so I cannot move Down on the next turn.\n> \n> - Collisions: with walls, obstacles, or body segments. But moving into the tail is okay if the tail moves away, except in the \"Tail Reward Danger\" case where if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (1,1), and head is at (3,6), so not adjacent. Head is at (3,6), tail at (1,1), which is not adjacent; adjacent would be like (2,1) or (1,2), etc. (3,6) to (1,1) is not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, food positions: (6,2) and (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is at y=6, which is the top row since y=7 is wall. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is the highest y can go without hitting wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head is at (3,6), and (5,6) is at the same y=6, x=5. So from (3,6) to (5,6) is two steps right, but since we move one cell per turn, I can go right to (4,6) then to (5,6).\n> \n> But (5,6) has food with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> The other food is at (6,2), which is bottom-left, since y=2.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so y=2 is above y=1.\n> \n> Snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Snake: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n> \n> So occupied: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6)\n> \n> And walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (6,4)\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2) and (5,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is at (5,6), which is not occupied, and not wall, so available.\n> \n> (6,2) is at x=6, y=2. x=6 is not wall, but y=0 is wall, so (6,2) is fine, but there's an obstacle at (6,4), but (6,2) is different, so should be okay.\n> \n> I need to think about the path to food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Since I need to maximize score, I should aim to eat both foods if possible, but prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the immediate options from (3,6) with direction Up.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,6), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> But cannot move Down because that's opposite to current direction (Up), so Down is invalid.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite on next turn, so from Up, I cannot go Down immediately.\n> \n> So possible: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Now, Up: to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so (3,7) is out of bounds, collision. So Up is invalid.\n> \n> Left: to (2,6). Is (2,6) occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), etc. (2,6) not in list, so free? Let's see: (2,6) is x=2,y=6.\n> \n> Occupied cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6). (2,6) not occupied. Also, not wall, since walls are borders and (6,4). So (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> Right: to (4,6). (4,6) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Down: invalid because opposite direction.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves: Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6). Up is wall, Down invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) is close; it's at (5,6), and I'm at (3,6), so I can go right twice to reach it: turn 27: Right to (4,6), then turn 28: Right to (5,6), eat food.\n> \n> But when I eat food at (5,6), the snake grows, so after eating, the new tail will be added, but since I move to (5,6) and eat, the head moves to (5,6), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the new position will be head at (5,6), then the previous head (3,6) becomes body, but I moved to (4,6) first.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current: head (3,6), body (3,5), etc.\n> \n> After move Right to (4,6): new head (4,6), body segments: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), ... down to (1,1). So positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] and tail at (1,1)? When head moves to (4,6), the segment that was at (1,1) might move or not depending on eating.\n> \n> When you move, if not eating food, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed. But if you eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 27, if I move to (4,6), is there food? (4,6) has no food, food is at (5,6) and (6,2), so (4,6) empty. So after move to (4,6), head is (4,6), body: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail (1,1) moves to (1,2)? Let's think of the list.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] index 0 to 7, head index 0.\n> \n> After moving to (4,6): new head (4,6), then the body segments shift: segment 1 (was (3,5)) moves to where head was (3,6), but no: the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n> \n> So after moving head to (4,6), the segment that was at (3,6) is now where? The head was at (3,6), moves to (4,6). Then the segment that was at (3,5) moves to (3,6), because that's where the segment ahead was. Similarly, (2,5) moves to (3,5), (1,5) moves to (2,5), (1,4) moves to (1,5), (1,3) moves to (1,4), (1,2) moves to (1,3), and the tail was at (1,1), which moves to (1,2), and (1,1) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — and (1,1) is free now.\n> \n> Length is still 8, no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, at turn 28, from (4,6), I can move to (5,6) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (5,6) has food, value +1.\n> \n> So move to (5,6): head to (5,6), which has food, so I eat it, and the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (5,6), then the body segments: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — and since I ate, the tail stays, so (1,2) is still there, and length increases to 9.\n> \n> After eating, the new segment is added where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, the position that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to food cell, the head is at new position, the body segments move as usual, but since food is eaten, the tail doesn't advance, so the last position is kept with an extra segment.\n> \n> After turn 28 move to (5,6) with food: head at (5,6), then the previous positions: before move, positions were [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n> \n> After head moves to (5,6), the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Head moves to (5,6), so new head (5,6).\n> \n> Then the segment that was at position 1 ( (3,6) ) moves to position 0's old position, which is (4,6)? Positions: let's index.\n> \n> Before move: index 0: (4,6), index 1: (3,6), index 2: (3,5), ..., index 7: (1,2)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,6): new index 0: (5,6)\n> \n> Then index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so (4,6)\n> \n> Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so (3,6)\n> \n> Index 3 moves to where index 2 was, so (3,5)\n> \n> Index 4 to (2,5)\n> \n> Index 5 to (1,5)\n> \n> Index 6 to (1,4)\n> \n> Index 7 to (1,3) — but since food eaten, instead of moving to (1,3), it stays at (1,2) and a new segment is added at (1,2)? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the last segment remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard: after moving the head to the new cell (with food), the body segments move as usual, but the tail segment is not removed; instead, it stays, and the new head position is added, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions before move: [A, B, C, ..., Z] where A is head, Z is tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell F (food), new positions: [F, A, B, C, ..., Z]  because Z doesn't move, so it's like the tail stays, and F is new head, A is now first body, etc.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Before move at turn 28: positions [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n> \n> Head moves to (5,6) with food, so new positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and (1,2) remains, so tail at (1,2). Length 9.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (5,6), the food is consumed, so it disappears.\n> \n> Now, there's another food at (6,2) with life span 5, starting from turn 27.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 27, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 32 it might be gone?

It's turn 28, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,6) from (3,6).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (6,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - At (5,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - At (2,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for the food at (6,2), life span 4 means it will disappear in 4 turns, so by turn 32 it might be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (5,6) life span 7, disappears by turn 35, and (2,3) life span 10, disappears by turn 38.\n> \n> Current turn is 28, so:\n> \n> - Food at (6,2): disappears after turn 31 (since life span decreases each turn, including 28, so after 4 turns: 28,29,30,31, gone at turn 32? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is L at turn T, it will be there until turn T + L - 1, and disappear at turn T + L? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, a food has life span N. After turn T, countdown is N-1 at turn T+1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn T, life span N, it can be eaten on turn T, and then countdown decreases to N-1 for turn T+1, and so on, until turn T + N - 1, it has countdown 1, can be eaten, then at turn T + N, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, turn 28, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 28,29,30,31. After turn 31, it disappears, so not available on turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): life span 7, available turns 28 to 34, gone on 35.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10, available turns 28 to 37.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,6), direction right.

L is opposite to R, so not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so next move cannot be L. So options: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Similarly y from 1 to 6? But walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 or y=7. So the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let's confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> x=1 to 6 inclusive? x=1,2,3,4,5,6; similarly y=1,2,3,4,5,6. But (6,4) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (4,6), body: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So tail is at (1,2).\n> \n> Food at: (6,2), (5,6), (2,3).\n> \n> (5,6) is at y=6, which is the top row? y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it says walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), which is near top since y=6 is close to y=7 wall. Similarly, (1,2) is bottom left.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): x=6, y=2, so bottom right area.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5, y=6, top right area, close to head.\n> \n> (2,3): x=2, y=3, left middle.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,5), which is free? Let's see if occupied.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So (4,5) is not in snake body, and not a wall except borders, but (4,5) is x=4,y=5, which is within 1-6, and no internal obstacle, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): to (5,6). Is (5,6) occupied? There is food at (5,6), but food can be eaten, so moving there would eat the food.\n> \n> But (5,6) is a cell, and food is there, so if head moves to (5,6), it eats the food.\n> \n> Left (L): to (3,6), but (3,6) is the second segment, so moving left would collide with body, since (3,6) is part of snake. Also, direction is right, so moving left is reverse, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) — y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) — free, I think\n> \n> - L: to (3,6) — body segment, collision, and reverse, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (5,6) — has food, but can eat\n> \n> So only two valid moves: D (down to (4,5)) or R (right to (5,6)) to eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,6), I eat the food at (5,6), which is positive, so snake length increases by one. After eating, the new head is at (5,6), and the tail stays or moves? When snake eats, the tail doesn't move immediately; the head moves to the food, grows, so the new segment is added at the head position, but since head moves, the tail remains until next move unless it's the turn of movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a food, it eats it, so the snake grows, meaning that after moving, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> Then on subsequent moves, the tail moves normally.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose head moves to food cell, then the snake adds a new head segment at that cell, and the tail doesn't advance, so positions become: new head at food, previous head becomes second segment, and so on, tail stays.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H(4,6), B1(3,6), B2(3,5), etc.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,6), which has food, so after move, head is at (5,6), and since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] but tail stayed, so now snake has 9 segments: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is tail.\n> \n> Direction would be R, since I moved right.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,5), no food there, so head moves to (4,5), tail moves forward, so positions become: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] and tail (1,2) is gone, so length 8 still. Tail moves to the next position, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> With eat, head moves to new cell, new segment added, no tail removal.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> I need to consider the food and their life spans.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) has life span 7, but since current turn 28, it can be eaten until turn 34. But it's very close, at (5,6), adjacent to head (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2) has short life, only until turn 31, so 4 turns including now: turns 28,29,30,31 to eat.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) has longer life.\n> \n> But (5,6) is immediate, I can eat it now.\n> \n> But I need to avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (1,2), which is far from head. Head at (4,6), tail at (1,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so distance 1 in grid.\n> \n> (1,2) to (4,6) is not adjacent; differences in x and y are large.\n> \n> So no issue with that for now.\n> \n> If I eat (5,6), I grow to length 9.\n> \n> Then head at (5,6), direction R.\n> \n> Now, from (5,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U to (5,7) is y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (5,5) — is it free?\n> \n> Current after eat: positions (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), etc., so (5,5) not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> L to (4,6) — but (4,6) is the second segment now, so body collision, invalid.\n> \n> Also, moving left would be opposite to current direction? Current direction after move is R, so moving left is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> R to (6,6) — x=6,y=6. x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 should be playable? Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=7 is wall, x=6 is not wall, similarly y=6 not wall.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) obstacle.\n> \n> So (6,6) should be free, but is it?\n> \n> After moving to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So (6,6) not occupied.\n> \n> But (6,6) is a cell, and no food there, I think.\n> \n> Food is at (6,2), (5,6) eaten, (2,3).\n> \n> So (6,6) free.\n> \n> Also, from (5,6), D to (5,5) free.\n> \n> L invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or R to (6,6).\n> \n> Now, if I go R to (6,6), head at (6,6), no food, so tail moves, positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] length 9, tail at (1,3)? After no eat, tail moves: head to (6,6), then segments: (5,6) to second, (4,6) to third, ..., down to (1,3) should be tail? Original tail was (1,2), but since no eat, tail moves off, so positions: new head (6,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes second, (4,6) third, (3,6) fourth, (3,5) fifth, (2,5) sixth, (1,5) seventh, (1,4) eighth, and (1,3) ninth? Let's list indices.\n> \n> Before move to (6,6): positions: index 0: (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,2) — 9 segments.\n> \n> After moving right to (6,6) no eat: head moves to (6,6), then segment 1 moves to where head was, but since head moved, each segment advances: so new position 0: (6,6), position 1: (5,6) [previous head], position 2: (4,6) [previous pos1], position 3: (3,6) [prev pos2], position 4: (3,5) [prev pos3], position 5: (2,5) [prev pos4], position 6: (1,5) [prev pos5], position 7: (1,4) [prev pos6], position 8: (1,3) [prev pos7], and tail (1,2) is gone. So now positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] — still 9 segments, tail at (1,3).\n> \n> (1,2) removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved down to (5,5) from (5,6), similar.\n> \n> But back to turn 28.\n> \n> If I don't eat the food at (5,6) now, I move down to (4,5).\n> \n> Then positions: head to (4,5), no eat, so tail moves: new positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] and tail (1,2) gone, so length 8, tail at (1,3)?

So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.

That means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 29, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 32? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 29, it has 3 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 31, so available on turns 29,30,31? Let's clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (6,2) with life_span=3 on turn 29:\n> \n> - Turn 29: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 30: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 31: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 32: life_span=0, so it disappears before turn 32 or on turn 32? It says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases each turn including current. So after N turns from now, it's gone. Since countdown starts at N on current turn.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is L on turn T, it will be present on turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1, and gone on turn T+L.\n> \n> For (6,2): life_span=3 on turn 29, so available on turns 29,30,31, gone on turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food is at (2,3) with value 1 and life_span=9, so it will be around for a long time, until turn 29+9-1=37, gone on 38.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so both are positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake.

So valid cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are valid? Let's see:\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning we cannot move there. So playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But y=6 is included? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 should be valid, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Confirm with snake positions: head at (5,6), and y=6 is not y=7, so y=6 is valid. Also, (1,2) etc., all x and y between 1 and 6 inclusive? (1,5), x=1, y=5; (1,4), etc. x=1 is not x=0, so it's valid.

U to (5,7) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (6,6)? (6,6) is within bounds? x=6, y=6. x=6 is not x=7, so valid? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is valid.

But it's at (6,2), which is bottom-right area? Grid: let's sketch.\n> \n> Assume x from left to right, y from bottom to top? In coordinates, usually (x,y), but in grids, y might increase upwards or downwards. Here, walls at y=0 and y=7, and snake at (5,6), which is high y, and (1,2) low y, so probably y increases upwards, so (1,2) is bottom-left, (5,6) is top-right area? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,6), which is near top-right.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): x=6, y=2, so bottom-right, near the wall.\n> \n> Food at (2,3): x=2, y=3, bottom-left area.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), which is on the way to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, to reach (6,2) from (5,6): I need to go down and right, but (6,4) is blocked, so I have to go around.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> If I go R to (6,6), then head at (6,6). From there, possible moves: U to (6,7) invalid, D to (6,5), L to (5,6), or R to (7,6) invalid. But L to (5,6) is where I came from, but (5,6) is now the neck? After move, snake moves, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> On turn 29, current positions: head (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n> \n> If I move R to (6,6), new head (6,6), then body: the tail (1,2) is removed?

Prioritizing long-term survival and the positive food at (2,3) with a long lifespan, the sequence moves down and left to safely navigate toward (2,3) while avoiding the high-risk right corner near the obstacle at (6,4), which could lead to traps. This path maximizes open space for future moves and aligns with the snake's body movement to minimize collision risks.\n",

It's turn 30, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake has 9 segments. The head direction is down (D), which means from (5,5), moving down would go to (5,4), but since it's moving down, and (5,5) is the head, moving down should decrease y, so to (5,4). Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards, I think. U: (x,y+1) means up increases y, so y=0 is bottom or top? Let's see: U: (x,y+1) – if y increases upwards, then U is up, D is down. But in the snake positions, head is at (5,5), and moving D, so if D is (x,y-1), that means decreasing y, so from (5,5) to (5,4) would be down. But in the positions, after head (5,5), it's (5,6), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, (5,6) is above (5,5), but the head is moving down? That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n> \n> Head is (5,5), and next is (5,6). If U is (x,y+1), meaning y+1 is up, so (5,6) has y=6, which is higher than y=5, so it's above (5,5). But the head direction is given as D, down. That doesn't make sense because if the head is at (5,5) and it moved to (5,6), that should be up, not down. Perhaps I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction. It says \"Snake Head Direction: D\", and positions are head first: (5,5) is head, then (5,6) is the next segment. But if head is at (5,5) and it's moving down (D, which is (x,y-1)), that would mean it's going to (5,4), but the next segment is (5,6), which is (x,y+1), so up. Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, but the direction is where it will move next? No, the state says \"Snake Head Direction: D\" for the current turn.\n> \n> Maybe the direction is the direction it was moving to get to the current head position. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] (head first, body segments follow)\" so (5,5) is head, (5,6) is first body segment, meaning the head was previously at (5,6) or something? Let's trace the snake.\n> \n> The snake body: from head (5,5), to (5,6), then to (4,6), etc. So, the head is at (5,5), and the segment behind it is (5,6). That means the snake was moving from (5,6) to (5,5), which is down, since y decreased from 6 to 5. Yes! So movement to current position: from (5,6) to (5,5) is down, so head direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Similarly, from (5,6) to (4,6) is left, then to (3,6) left, to (3,5) down, to (2,5) left, to (1,5) left, to (1,4) down, to (1,3) down.\n> \n> So current head position is (5,5), and it just moved down to get there, so direction is D. Now, for the next move, I can choose to go U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it's moving down, I cannot move up (U) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U on this turn. Possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But not U.\n> \n> Now, food positions: (6,2,2,1) and (2,3,8,1). The format is (x, y, life_span, value). So (6,2) with life_span 2, value 1; and (2,3) with life_span 8, value 1. Both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Life_span: for (6,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 30, life_span=2, so after this turn, it will have 1 left, then after turn 31, it disappears, so can only be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) has life_span 8, so it will last until turn 37 or something.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's see: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Confirm: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0 to 7? No, cells occupied by walls: if x=0 or x=7 for any y, or y=0 or y=7 for any x, I think. \"Border cells: x=... y=...\" but it says \"x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is 8x8, but only inner 6x6 is playable: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So let's plot this.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head: (5,5)\n> \n> Body: (5,6) - above head, since y=6\n> \n> (4,6) - left of (5,6)\n> \n> (3,6) - left of (4,6)\n> \n> (3,5) - down from (3,6) to (3,5)\n> \n> (2,5) - left from (3,5) to (2,5)\n> \n> (1,5) - left from (2,5) to (1,5)\n> \n> (1,4) - down from (1,5) to (1,4)\n> \n> (1,3) - down from (1,4) to (1,3)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the top and left side.\n> \n> Food: (6,2) and (2,3)\n> \n> (6,2) is bottom-right, x=6,y=2\n> \n> (2,3) is left, x=2,y=3\n> \n> Internal wall at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Current turn: 30\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,5) with direction D (down), so cannot move U (up), can move D (down to (5,4)), L (left to (4,5)), R (right to (6,5)).\n> \n> But (6,5): x=6, y=5. Is this a wall? Walls are border or internal. Border: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle is (6,4), which is different. (6,5) is not (6,4), so (6,5) should be free, but let's see if snake body is there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). None at (6,5), so (6,5) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> (4,5): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> (5,6) is body, but that's above, not (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, food is at (6,2) and (2,3), both value 1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see the immediate moves.\n> \n> Option 1: Move down (D) to (5,4)\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: since I moved down, direction now D, so cannot move U, can move D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4). But (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there. So from (5,4), moves: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R not possible.\n> \n> (6,4) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Option 2: Move left (L) to (4,5)\n> \n> From (4,5), previous direction L (since moved left), so cannot move R, can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5). But (4,6) is body part, currently occupied by snake? Positions: (4,6) is the third segment. But when I move, the snake moves, so after moving to (4,5), the new positions: head to (4,5), then the tail moves? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail segment is removed unless eating food.\n> \n> So on turn 30, if I move to (4,5), new head is (4,5), then body: (5,5) becomes first body segment, then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) is removed since no food eaten. So new positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]? Let's sequence: head new at (4,5), then previous head (5,5) is now body, then (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5), then (1,4), and (1,3) is gone. So positions: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). 9 segments still? No, length unchanged unless eat food.\n> \n> Initially 9 segments, no food eaten, so after move, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake has same length, positions shift.\n> \n> Original positions: 9 cells.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the segment ahead, so the last position is vacated.\n> \n> So from turn 30 move:\n> \n> If move to (4,5): head to (4,5), then the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where? The body follows: the first body segment was at (5,6), but after head moves to (4,5), the neck becomes (5,5), which was the old head position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell; if not eating, the tail is removed, and body segments shift.\n> \n> So positions list: after moving head to new pos, the new body is the previous head, then previous body except the last one is omitted if no growth.\n> \n> Easier: the new positions are [new_head] + previous_positions[:-1] if no food eaten.\n> \n> Previous positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n> \n> If move to (4,5), new head (4,5), then new body: previous head (5,5) and then previous body from index 1 to 8, but since no growth, we take all except the last element? Let's index.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,5), new head (4,5), then new body positions: the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head, but the body segments take the positions of the previous segments: segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (5,5), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (5,6)?

Coordinates: since walls at y=0 and y=7, the playable area is y=1 to y=6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7) are walls, (7,0) to (7,7), and (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to7? The description says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles like (6,4).\n> \n> So for (5,4):\n> \n> - Move D: (5,3) – x=5, y=3, not on border, not obstacle?

Tail is (1,4). So moving to (5,5) would cause collision with body segment. Also, cannot do U because it's reverse direction? Current direction is D, so moving U is reverse, which is not allowed.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is N, it disappears after N turns. For (6,2), life span 1, so after turn 31, it's gone, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 31 if we move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 31 + 6 = turn 37? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: present for N turns. Countdown decreases each turn, starting from N down to 1, and on turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears? Or after N turns?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if life span is N, then after N turns, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to t + N - 1? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so if at turn t, life span is N, then on turn t, countdown is N, on turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., down to turn t + N - 1, countdown 1, and on turn t + N, it disappears, so not available.\n> \n> So for (6,2) at turn 31, life span 1, countdown 1, so it can be eaten on turn 31.

So from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) or (5,2) or (4,3), etc, but not directly to (6,2).

No.\n> \n> When head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So current positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: tail (1,4)\n> \n> After move head to (5,3): new head at (5,3), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,4), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,5), but segment 1 was at (5,5), so segment 2 moves to (5,5)? Let's sequence:\n> \n> - New head position: (5,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 (was at (5,5)) moves to previous position of head, which is (5,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (was at (5,6)) moves to previous position of segment 1, which is (5,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 3 (was at (4,6)) moves to previous position of segment 2, which is (5,6)? Segment 2 was at (5,6), so segment 3 moves to (5,6)\n> \n> But (5,6) is the same cell, but it's moving to it, but in terms of position, segment 3 was at (4,6), moves to where segment 2 was, (5,6).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 4 (was at (3,6)) moves to where segment 3 was, (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 5 (was at (3,5)) moves to where segment 4 was, (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 6 (was at (2,5)) moves to where segment 5 was, (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 7 (was at (1,5)) moves to where segment 6 was, (2,5)\n> \n> Tail segment 8 (was at (1,4)) moves to where segment 7 was, (1,5)\n> \n> So new snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> Tail is now at (1,5), and (1,4) is free now.\n> \n> If I go L to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then body: segment 1 to (5,4), segment 2 to (5,5), segment 3 to (5,6), segment 4 to (4,6), segment 5 to (3,6), segment 6 to (3,5), segment 7 to (2,5), segment 8 to (1,5), tail to (1,4)? Segment 8 was tail at (1,4), moves to where segment 7 was, (1,5)?

It's turn 32. The grid has walls: border cells meaning x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but the walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are described as: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" That means any cell where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So the snake can only move within x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). Head direction is D, which is down, meaning the snake was moving downward to (5,3) from (5,4)? Let's see the positions: the head is first in the list, so at turn 32, head is at (5,3), and it was previously at (5,4) since that's the next segment. Direction is D, down, which decreases y, so from (5,4) to (5,3) is down, since y decreases from 4 to 3.\n> \n> In coordinate systems, y=0 is often top, but in this case, since moving down decreases y, that suggests y=0 is bottom? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that means y increases upward, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But the walls are at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> In the positions, snake has segments from (5,3) to (1,5). Let's list them:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,4)  // this is the neck, I think\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (1,5)\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so it moved down to (5,3) from (5,4).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value 1, so +1 point and snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (2,3), life span 7 at turn 32, so it will disappear after turn 32 + 7 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after this turn, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> In this case, turn 32, food at (2,3) has life span 7, so it can be eaten until turn 38 (since 32 to 38 is 7 turns: turn 32,33,34,35,36,37,38; at turn 39 it disappears? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 32, life span 7.\n> \n> After turn 32, life span becomes 6.\n> \n> After turn 33, life span 5, and so on, down to after turn 38, life span 0, so it disappears at turn 39.

It's turn 33, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) are the borders, and moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? But looking at the snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]. Let's check y=6: (5,6) and (4,6) and (3,6) are at y=6, and y=6 is not y=7, so y=6 is within bounds. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 are free. Similarly, x from 1 to 6. x=0 and x=7 are walls. So playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But (5,6) has y=6, which is not y=7, so it's ok. Internal obstacle at (6,4), which is a wall cell, so we cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (4,3), tail at (2,5). Direction is L, which is left, so moving left. Current head is (4,3), and direction L means last move was left to (4,3), so from (5,3) to (4,3), since positions are head first: [(4,3), (5,3), ...] so head is (4,3), then body (5,3), which is to the right, so yes, moving left to (4,3).\n> \n> Food positions: one at (2,3) with value 1 and life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 33, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 38 (33+5=38? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N -1 or t + N? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, when food is present, life_span is N, then after this turn, at turn t+1, life_span becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=1, after which it disappears. So for food at (2,3) with life_span=6 at turn 33, it will be there until turn 33 + 6 - 1 = 38? At turn 33, life_span=6, after turn 33, it decreases to 5, so at turn 34, life_span=5, ..., at turn 38, life_span=1, then after turn 38, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 38. Similarly, the other food at (1,1) with life_span=8 at turn 33, so it will be there until turn 33 + 8 - 1 = 40.\n> \n> Food: (2,3,6,1) and (1,1,8,1) – in the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), I think. \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2, 3, 6, 1) - (1, 1, 8, 1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value). Both have value 1, so both are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction L, so current movement is left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R, because no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left.\n> \n> From (4,3), moving:\n> \n> - Up: (4,4) since U: (x,y+1)\n> \n> - Down: (4,2) D: (x,y-1)\n> \n> - Left: (3,3) L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> - Right: (5,3) but cannot, reverse.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,4): x=4,y=4, within 1-6, ok.\n> \n> (4,2): x=4,y=2, ok.\n> \n> (3,3): x=3,y=3, ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), not relevant for these moves.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> So body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> After moving, the snake will move, so the tail will move away, but for collision, we need to see if the head moves into a body segment that is not the tail, because when the snake moves, the tail leaves its position.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment other than the current tail, it's collision. But if it's the tail, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (2,5). If head moves to a cell that is the tail, and tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> But for other body parts, if head moves there, collision.\n> \n> Now, let's list all body cells except head: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up to (4,4): is (4,4) occupied?

No: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail grows, meaning that the tail stays in place or something? Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So, when head moves to food, the head is now there, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, on that turn, you move to the food, and since you ate, the tail doesn't retract, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> But the positions: before move, head at position, you move to new cell, if it's food, snake grows, so the new head is at the new cell, and the tail remains where it is, so the body gains one segment.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: [head, body..., tail]\n> \n> You move to new cell.\n> \n> If not food, new positions: [new_head] + [previous positions except tail] , so tail is removed.\n> \n> If food, new positions: [new_head] + [all previous positions], so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,3) and eat, head is now (2,3), and previous positions all remain, so body includes (4,3), (5,3), etc, and tail (2,5).\n> \n> Now, the new segment is added at the end, but since tail was (2,5), and we don't move the tail, the tail is still (2,5), but now the snake has grown, so the tail is the same cell, but it's now part of the body, and the new tail is the second last or something?

sentences):\n> Prioritized eating the short-life food at (2,3) by turn 36 to avoid missing it, then navigated toward (1,1) to consume it by turn 39, ensuring both are eaten within their life spans while avoiding immediate risks and maintaining maneuverability with a shorter snake initially. This sequence focuses on securing guaranteed rewards first, with the option to pursue (6,3) later if feasible, given its longer life span.\n",

It's turn 35. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the borders are walls, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is deadly. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So that's 9 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y.\n> \n> Head is at (3,2), and direction is D, so it was moving down to (3,2) from (3,3)? Positions are given head first: [(3,2), (3,3), ...] so head is at (3,2), and the next segment is (3,3), which is above it since y=3 > y=2, so if head is at (3,2) and previous was (3,3), that means it moved down from (3,3) to (3,2), so direction D makes sense: from (3,3) to (3,2) is decreasing y.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,3), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn. So on turn 35, life span 4, so it will be gone after turn 38? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For food at (2,3): life span 4 on turn 35. So:\n> \n> - Turn 35: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 36: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 37: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 38: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life span 6 on turn 35, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> (6,3): life span 9 on turn 35, disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 35.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction is D, so cannot move U immediately, because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> D is (x,y-1), U is (x,y+1), so U is opposite of D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Move D: to (3,1)\n> \n> But y=1, and walls at y=0, but y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), which is within bounds.\n> \n> Now, check if moving to (3,1) is safe.\n> \n> (3,1): is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So body segments: (3,3) to (3,6), etc. (3,1) is not in the list, so no body there. Walls: y=0 is wall, but (3,1) has y=1, not 0, so should be safe, but let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells: 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6.\n> \n> (3,1): x=3, y=1, which is within 1 to 6, so not wall. Also, internal obstacle only at (6,4), so not there. Body not there. So moving D to (3,1) is safe in terms of collision this turn.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Similarly, move L: to (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2): not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle.

So (4,2) not there, (2,2) not there, (3,1) not there.\n> \n> Also, food: (2,3) at (2,3), which is a body segment? Snake positions include (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), but (2,3) is not a snake segment. Snake segments are (3,3), etc., so (2,3) is free?

Current head (3,2), so (2,3) is left and up? From (3,2), (2,3) is x-1, y+1, so not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (3,1) down, (3,3) up, (2,2) left, (4,2) right. (2,3) is diagonal, not directly reachable in one move.\n> \n> To reach (2,3), I need to go to (2,2) or (3,3) or (2,3) directly, but from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,3) or etc.\n> \n> From (3,2), moving L to (2,2) gets me closer to (2,3).

(3,2) is the second segment, directly connected to head.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,2), which is currently occupied by the body, but after movement, the head would be at (3,2), and the body segment that was at (3,2) would move to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently occupied, so immediately upon moving, head is at same position as body, collision.\n> \n> Only if moving to the tail position, and tail moves away, it might be ok.\n> \n> But here, (3,2) is not tail.\n> \n> For example, if tail is at S, and head moves to S, then head and tail are same, but tail moves to new position, so after move, head is at S, and tail was at S but moves to the next, so if the snake doesn't grow, tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,2) is not tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (2,2), index 1: (3,2), index 2: (3,3), etc. up to index 8: tail (4,6)\n> \n> If I move head to (3,2), which is position of index 1.\n> \n> After move, new head position is (3,2), but index 1 was at (3,2), so now head and index 1 are both at (3,2), collision.\n> \n> Then index 1 moves to where head was, but head was at (2,2), so index 1 moves to (2,2), but at that moment, multiple things at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Typically in snake, moving to a cell that is occupied by body except the tail causes collision.\n> \n> Rule says: body collision if head touches any body segment, except when moving to the tail cell if it's the only one and tail moves.\n> \n> But here, since (3,2) is adjacent and not tail, moving to it causes collision.\n> \n> Moving to (1,2) or (2,1) or (2,3) should be fine.\n> \n> (2,3) has food, so moving there eats it.\n> \n> Now, direction: current head direction is L, so I cannot move right immediately because no instant reverse.

Value +1, snake grows, so new length 10 segments.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so when I move to (2,3), head is now at (2,3), and since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the body extends: the previous head position (2,2) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) tail. So tail still at (4,6), no change since we ate food, tail stays.\n> \n> When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell. So positions: new head at food cell, and the previous body remains, but since tail doesn't move, the segment before tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Current positions: segments S0=(2,2), S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), S3=(4,3), S4=(5,3), S5=(5,4), S6=(5,5), S7=(5,6), S8=(4,6)\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3) and eat food, new head is (2,3), and S0 is now (2,2) as first body, S1=(3,2), etc., and since I ate, tail S8=(4,6) stays, so new segment added at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move to food, head moves to new position, the body follows, but since you eat, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (2,3), then the previous head (2,2) becomes next segment, then S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), ..., S7=(5,6), and S8=(4,6), but since we ate, we add a new segment at S8, so S8 is still (4,6), and a new S9 at the previous tail position? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves one step, head to new cell. If no food, tail moves away from its position. If food, tail doesn't move, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, and a new segment is added there, but since tail doesn't move, the position remains, and length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move, head is new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, and if no food, the last position (tail) is vacated; if food, the tail position is kept and a new segment is added, so the tail index increases.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P8\n> \n> Move head to new position Q.\n> \n> Then new positions: head Q, then P0, P1, P2, ..., P7, and if no food, P8 is vacated, so positions Q, P0, P1, ..., P7 (8 segments? No.\n> \n> P0 to P8 is 9 positions.\n> \n> After move: head at new position, say N.\n> \n> Then the body segments: segment 1 moves to P0, segment 2 moves to P1, ..., segment 8 moves to P7, and if no food, segment 9 (tail) moves to P8, but P8 is vacated.\n> \n> If food, segment 9 stays at P8, and a new segment is added at P8? No.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to N, the first body segment moves to the old head position P0, second body to old first body position P1, and so on, up to the tail: if no food, tail moves to the position before it, and the old tail position is vacated. If food, the tail does not move, so the old tail position is still occupied, and the snake has one more segment; the new tail is the old tail, and a segment is added.\n> \n> Positions: new head at N.\n> \n> Then new body segment 1 at old head P0.\n> \n> New body segment 2 at old segment 1 position P1.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New body segment 8 at old segment 7 position P7.\n> \n> Then for the tail: if no food, new tail at old segment 8 position P8.\n> \n> If food, new tail at old segment 8 position P8, and since tail doesn't move, we keep P8 occupied, and the segment that was at P8 is now the new last body, and we add a new tail at the same P8? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it: the positions are a list.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell, the tail is removed only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail is not removed, so the length increases.\n> \n> So before move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] for k+1 segments.\n> \n> Move head to Q.\n> \n> If no food, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]  -- tail Pk is removed, so from k+1 to k segments? No.\n> \n> [P0, P1, ..., Pk] has k+1 segments.\n> \n> After move to Q with no food: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] -- this has (k+1) segments? Q and then P0 to P_{k-1} is k segments, but P0 to P_{k-1} is k points, plus Q is k+1, but Pk is missing, so it's shorter.\n> \n> For example, 3 segments: H, B, T.\n> \n> Move H to new position N.\n> \n> If no food, new head N, new body at old H, new tail at old B. So positions [N, H, B] -- but B was tail, now it's body, and tail was removed? Positions: from [H,B,T] to [N,H,B] , so T is removed, length same.\n> \n> If food, [N,H,B,T] -- T is kept, length increases.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> Current: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ] 9 segments.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3) with food, new positions: head (2,3), then old head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), and tail (4,6) since we ate, so we keep the tail, so new positions: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ] 10 segments.

After move, body segment 1 moves to old head (2,2), segment 2 to old segment 1 (3,2), ..., segment 8 to old segment 7 (5,6), and since no food, no new segment, so tail is at (5,6), and (4,6) is vacated.

But if it moves to the tail's current position, it might be ok because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,3), moving D to (2,2): (2,2) is currently occupied by index 1, which is not the tail; tail is at (4,6). So moving to (2,2) would cause head to hit the body at (2,2), which doesn't move away immediately; it only moves after head moves. So yes, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Also, walls or obstacles.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4) - check if occupied: not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. (2,4) is y=4, x=2, within bounds. So possible.\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) - but (2,2) is occupied by body (index 1), so deadly collision. Not possible.\n> \n> - L: left to (1,3) - x=1,y=3. Walls at x=0, so x=1 is ok. Not occupied? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc. No (1,3). Food? (1,1) and (1,5), not (1,3). So (1,3) should be free. Possible.\n> \n> - R: right to (3,3) - (3,3) is occupied by index 3 body segment. Not tail, so collision. Not possible.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (2,4) or L to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, but since we're choosing next move, we can go to U or L, but not D or R as above.\n> \n> D is impossible because it's occupied, R is impossible.\n> \n> So choices: U or L.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> First, food at (1,1) with life span 4, so it disappears at turn 40. Current turn 37, so 37,38,39,40 it will be there? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 37, life span 4, after this turn, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 at turn 40, so it disappears before turn 41? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,1), life span 4 at turn 37. After turn 37, countdown becomes 3, so at turn 38, life span 3. After turn 38, 2; turn 39, 1; after turn 40, 0, so it disappears before turn 41. So it can be eaten on turns 37,38,39,40? On turn 40, if eaten, it should be before it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, food is available until the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0, I think. But to be safe, we can eat it on turns 37 to 40 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the snake's path.\n> \n> Current head at (2,3), tail at (4,6).\n> \n> If I move U to (2,4), new head at (2,4), then body moves: (2,3) becomes new segment 1, (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> After move U:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3) (previous head position)\n> \n> - Segment at (3,2) moves to (2,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> After head moves to (2,4):\n> \n> The body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position (2,3), so index 1 (2,2) moves to (2,3), but (2,3) was head, so now it's occupied by the segment.\n> \n> Then index 2 (3,2) moves to where index 1 was, but index 1 was (2,2), so (3,2) moves to (2,2).\n> \n> Similarly, index 3 (3,3) moves to where index 2 was, (3,2)? Let's list new positions:\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then new segment 1: old head position (2,3)\n> \n> New segment 2: position of old segment 1, which was (2,2)\n> \n> But old segment 1 was at (2,2), so it moves to (2,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard: after head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New position 0 (head): (2,4)\n> \n> - New position 1: position of old position 0, which was (2,3)\n> \n> - New position 2: position of old position 1, which was (2,2)\n> \n> - New position 3: position of old position 2, which was (3,2)\n> \n> - New position 4: position of old position 3, which was (3,3)\n> \n> - New position 5: position of old position 4, which was (4,3)\n> \n> - New position 6: position of old position 5, which was (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 7: position of old position 6, which was (5,4)\n> \n> - New position 8: position of old position 7, which was (5,5)\n> \n> - New position 9 (tail): position of old position 8, which was (5,6)\n> \n> Old position 8 is (5,6), so tail moves to (5,6)? But old tail was at (4,6), which was position 9.\n> \n> Positions: old index 9 is (4,6)\n> \n> After move, new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - 1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - 2: old body1 (2,2)\n> \n> - 3: old body2 (3,2)\n> \n> - 4: old body3 (3,3)\n> \n> - 5: old body4 (4,3)\n> \n> - 6: old body5 (5,3)\n> \n> - 7: old body6 (5,4)\n> \n> - 8: old body7 (5,5)\n> \n> - 9: old body8 (5,6)  // old body8 is (5,6), which was index 8\n> \n> Old index 8 is (5,6), and old index 9 is (4,6). Since index 9 moves to old index 8 position, so new tail at (5,6). And (4,6) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (1,3), new head at (1,3), then body: new pos1 at (2,3), new pos2 at (2,2), etc., similar shift.\n> \n> Now, back to choices: from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4) or L to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to consider food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (6,3), (1,5).\n> \n> (1,1) is close, at turn 37 with life 4.\n> \n> (6,3) is at (6,3), which is near the body.\n> \n> (1,5) is also on the left side.\n> \n> First, let's see if I can eat (1,1) soon.\n> \n> From (2,3), if I go L to (1,3), then head at (1,3).

At (1,2), head at (1,2), then move D to (1,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is the food cell. When I eat, head moves to (1,1), and since it's food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> After eating, the new tail position is not moved, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving to food, the head is at food cell, and the body remains, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Now, from (1,2), moving D to (1,1) should be fine, no collision.\n> \n> But let's see the life span: food at (1,1) has life span 4 at turn 37. If I move to (1,1) on turn 37, I can eat it immediately if I choose L first? Turn 37 action.\n> \n> On turn 37, if I choose L, head moves to (1,3), not to (1,1) yet.\n> \n> Turn 37: action, say L, move to (1,3)\n> \n> Then turn 38: from (1,3), I can move D to (1,2)\n> \n> Turn 39: from (1,2), move D to (1,1) to eat food.\n> \n> On turn 39, I eat it, and life span was 4 at turn 37, after turn 37, life span 3, turn 38 life span 2, turn 39 life span 1, so on turn 39 it can be eaten, before disappearing on turn 40.\n> \n> After turn 39, life span becomes 0, so it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go directly, but from (2,3) I can't go to (1,1) in one move.\n> \n> If I go U first, to (2,4), then I might not reach (1,1) in time.\n> \n> (1,1) disappears at turn 40, so last chance to eat is turn 39 or 40?

(3,4) not occupied, probably free.\n> \n> But to go to (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n> \n> Say turn 37 U to (2,4)\n> \n> Then turn 38: from (2,4), move L to (1,4)\n> \n> Turn 39: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n> \n> Turn 40: from (1,3), move D to (1,2)\n> \n> But on turn 40, food at (1,1) has life span 0? At turn 37, life span 4. After turn 37, it becomes 3. After turn 38, 2. After turn 39, 1. After turn 40, 0, so on turn 40, before moving, life span is 1? Let's clarify the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn t, when we start, food has life_span L.\n> \n> After the turn, after action, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn 37, food at (1,1) has life_span 4.\n> \n> After turn 37 actions, it decreases to 3.\n> \n> After turn 38, to 2.\n> \n> After turn 39, to 1.\n> \n> After turn 40, to 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So on turn 40, before action, life_span is 1, so if I move to it on turn 40, I can eat it, and after eating, life_span becomes 0, but since I ate it, it's consumed.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 39, life_span is 1 before action? At beginning of turn, life_span is current.\n> \n> For turn t, at start, life_span is given. After the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> So for eating on turn t: when head moves to food cell during turn t, it is eaten, and then after the turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> But since it's eaten, it disappears anyway.\n> \n> So food can be eaten as long as life_span > 0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 37, life_span 4 >0, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 38, life_span 3>0, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 39, life_span 2>0, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 40, life_span 1>0, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 41, life_span 0, not available.\n> \n> So last chance turn 40.\n> \n> In my earlier plan, if I go L on turn 37 to (1,3), then turn 38 to (1,2), turn 39 to (1,1) eat.\n> \n> Or turn 37 L to (1,3), turn 38 D to (1,2), turn 39 D to (1,1) eat.\n> \n> But from (1,3), on turn 38, I could go directly to (1,1)?

It's turn 39, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 10 segments. The head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, that means from (1,2) to (1,3) is down, but (1,2) to (1,3) is actually moving down in y-direction? Let me clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is (x,y+1), that means y increases as we go up, I assume. But in the snake positions, from head (1,2) to (1,3), and head direction is D. D is down, which is (x,y-1), but from (1,2) to (1,3) is increasing y, so that should be up, not down. There might be confusion.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and \"Snake Positions: [(1,2), (1,3), ...]\". If head is at (1,2) and moving to (1,3), that's an increase in y, so if U is (x,y+1), that should be up. But the direction is given as D, which is down. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinates: U (x,y+1) means y increases up, so (1,2) to (1,3) is up. But head direction is D, down. But the positions show head at (1,2) and next segment at (1,3), which is higher y, so it was moving up to get to (1,2)? Let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3), etc. So the head is at (1,2), and the body behind it is at (1,3). That means the snake was moving from (1,3) to (1,2), which is decreasing y, so down direction. Yes: from (1,3) to (1,2) is down, since y decreased from 3 to 2. So head at (1,2), came from (1,3), so it was moving down to reach (1,2). Therefore, current head direction is down, meaning if it continues down, it would go to (1,1).\n> \n> But (1,1) might have food; let's see food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2 (I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), so (1,1,2,1) means x=1,y=1, life_span=2, value=1)\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3,5,1) is x=6,y=3, life_span=5, value=1\n> \n> (1,5,8,1) is x=1,y=5, life_span=8, value=1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1 for all, so no negative food here. Value=1, which is positive.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (1,1) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t=39, life_span=2, so at turn 40, life_span becomes 1, and at turn 41, it disappears. Similarly, (6,3) has life_span=5, so disappears at turn 39+5=44? Life_span decreases each turn, so if current turn is t, food with life_span L will be there for L turns, disappearing after t + L - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it's gone. Countdown decreases each turn, starting from L at turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span = L, then at turn t+1, life_span = L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, life_span = 1, then at turn t + L, it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 39, life_span=2, so it will be there on turn 39 and 40, disappear on turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life_span=5, present from turn 39 to 43, disappear on 44.\n> \n> (1,5): life_span=8, present from 39 to 46, disappear on 47.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,2), direction down. Moving down would go to (1,1), which has food.\n> \n> But we have to consider if it's safe to eat it.\n> \n> First, movement options. Current direction is D, down. So possible moves: since no instant reverse, cannot move up, because up is opposite of down. Opposite of down is up. Directions: U up, D down, L left, R right.\n> \n> Current head direction D, so cannot move U (up) next turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, from (1,2):\n> \n> - D: to (1,1)\n> \n> - L: to (0,2), but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left to (0,2), wall.\n> \n> - R: to (2,2)\n> \n> - U: cannot, instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> Now, (1,1) has food, and it's positive. But we need to check if eating it is safe, especially regarding tail collision.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,2), then segments: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> After moving, if snake moves, the tail will move, etc.\n> \n> If I move to (1,1) and eat the food, the snake grows, so new head at (1,1), and tail doesn't move? When you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the head is on food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position stays, and body extends.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the snake moves forward, head to new cell, and since food is eaten, a new segment is added where the tail was, so tail doesn't move; it grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: current positions: let's list cells:\n> \n> Head: (1,2)\n> \n> Body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)  // 9 body segments, total 10 cells.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,1), which has food, so I eat it. Then new head is at (1,1), and the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added, so the snake grows to 11 segments. The new tail will be... after movement, the head moves to (1,1), and each segment moves to the next position, but since food eaten, the tail stays and new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Sequence: snake moves head to new position. If new position has food, then the tail does not move; a new segment is created at the old tail position. So the body segments shift, but tail stays.\n> \n> So positions after eating: head at (1,1), then the previous head (1,2) becomes second segment, then (1,3) becomes third, and so on, up to the tail (5,5) remains tail, and since food eaten, a new segment is added after (5,5), so new tail at (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: tail (5,5)\n> \n> After move down to (1,1) and eat food: new head at (1,1), then segment 1: old head (1,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (1,3), segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3), ..., up to segment 10: old segment 9 (5,5), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of old tail, so segment 11: (5,5), but old tail was at (5,5), so new segment at (5,5), but that means two segments at (5,5)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong. When snake moves, all segments shift forward: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So the tail position is vacated. If food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the tail doesn't move effectively.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> After moving down to (1,1):\n> \n> - New head: (1,1)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (1,2)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 (1,3)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old segment 9 (5,5)  // this is the tail that was moved to, but since food eaten, we add a new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> Old tail was at (5,5). When snake moves, the segment that was at index 8 (5,4) moves to index 9 position, which is old tail (5,5). Then, since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before the move, which is (5,5), but now (5,5) is occupied by the segment that moved there.\n> \n> Standard: before move, tail is at P_tail.\n> \n> After move, head to new cell, each segment shifts, so the cell P_tail is vacated, and the new tail is at the position that was second-to-last or something.\n> \n> Positions before move: S0, S1, S2, ..., S9\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new:\n> \n> - New S0 = H_new\n> \n> - New S1 = S0 (old head)\n> \n> - New S2 = S1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New S9 = S8\n> \n> The last segment S9 (tail) is not in new positions; instead, new positions are from new S0 to new S9, where new S9 = S8.\n> \n> Then, if food eaten, add a new segment at the position of S9 (old tail), so new snake has segments: new S0 to new S9, and new S10 = old S9.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> After move down to (1,1):\n> \n> New head: (1,1)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head (1,2)\n> \n> New segment 2: old seg1 (1,3)\n> \n> New segment 3: old seg2 (2,3)\n> \n> New segment 4: old seg3 (2,2)\n> \n> New segment 5: old seg4 (3,2)\n> \n> New segment 6: old seg5 (3,3)\n> \n> New segment 7: old seg6 (4,3)\n> \n> New segment 8: old seg7 (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 9: old seg8 (5,4)  // this is the new tail if no food\n> \n> But since food eaten, we add new segment 10 at old tail position (5,5)\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5) as the new tail.\n> \n> Old tail was (5,5), and it's still there as part of body, but now the tail is at (5,5) and (5,4) is segment before.\n> \n> In the new snake, (5,5) is the last segment, tail.\n> \n> But in the positions, (5,4) and (5,5) are both occupied.\n> \n> Now, back to the move: if I move to (1,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 11 segments.\n> \n> But is it safe? The head is at (1,1), and the body is at (1,2), (1,3), etc. No immediate collision.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to head at (1,1). Adjacent means next to, like up, down, left, right. (1,1) and (5,5) are far apart, not adjacent. So no danger here.\n> \n> Moreover, (1,1) has food, and it's about to disappear soon; life_span 2, so after this turn, it has one turn left, but if I eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, other option: move right to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is currently occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), ... so (2,2) is the fourth segment, index 3.\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), which is a body segment, that would be collision, death.\n> \n> Is that right? (2,2) is occupied by the snake itself, so moving there would cause head to touch body, collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (2,2) is not the tail; tail is at (5,5). So (2,2) is a body segment, so moving to (2,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, moving right to (2,2) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Only possible move is down to (1,1), which has food.\n> \n> But is there a wall? (1,1) is not wall; walls are borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (6,4). (1,1) is within 1 to 6 in x and y, so safe.\n> \n> So for turn 39, I should move down to (1,1) and eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, after this, what happens.\n> \n> First, let's confirm the action for turn 39.\n> \n> Possible actions: only D or R, but R to (2,2) is occupied, so only D is possible? L to (0,2) is wall, U not allowed, R to (2,2) body, so only D to (1,1) is safe and has food.\n> \n> But when I move to (1,1), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now, after this, head at (1,1), direction was down, but after move, new direction is down? I need to set the new head direction.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction is the direction I moved.\n> \n> So after turn 39, head at (1,1), direction D (down).\n> \n> Now, for turn 40.\n> \n> Head at (1,1), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (1,1), down would be to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down.\n> \n> Left to (0,1), x=0 wall, cannot.\n> \n> Right to (2,1)\n> \n> Up to (1,2)  // but current direction down, up is opposite, so cannot instant reverse?

Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases upwards? That might be counterintuitive, but I'll go with it. Typically in grids, y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y=0 is bottom? Let's see the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake positions: (1,1) is head, and it's moving down to (1,2)? Head is at (1,1), direction D, which is (x,y-1), so if y decreases when moving down, that makes sense. For example, from (1,1) moving D would go to (1,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't. But in the positions, after head (1,1), next is (1,2), which might be inconsistent.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> Head is (1,1), and the segment behind it is (1,2). Since the snake is moving, the head is at (1,1) and it was previously at (1,2)? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the direction indicates where it moved to get to the current head position.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it moved down to reach (1,1). So from where? If it moved down to (1,1), that means it came from (1,2), because D is (x,y-1), so from (1,2) to (1,1) by moving down.\n> \n> Yes, that matches the positions: head is (1,1), and the next segment is (1,2), so the head was at (1,2) before moving down to (1,1). But the positions list has (1,1) first, then (1,2), which is the body. After (1,2) is (1,3), so the snake was going up or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (1,1) head, index 1: (1,2), index 2: (1,3), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (2,2), index 5: (3,2), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (4,3), index 8: (5,3), index 9: (5,4), index 10: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Since head is at (1,1) and direction is D, it just moved down from (1,2) to (1,1). But before that, it must have been at (1,3) or something. The body segment at (1,2) was the previous head position.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,5), so when the snake moves, the tail will leave that position.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn, so by turn 44 it will be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 7, so disappears at turn 47.\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 10, disappears at turn 50.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 40.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, but with internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (1,1)\n> \n> Body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Tail: (5,5)\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it just moved down to (1,1). Since it can't reverse instantly, it cannot move Up next, because Up is opposite to Down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,1):\n> \n> - Up: U to (1,1+1) = (1,2) but (1,2) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Down: D to (1,1-1) = (1,0), but y=0 is wall, collision.\n> \n> - Left: L to (1-1,1) = (0,1), x=0 is wall, collision.\n> \n> - Right: R to (1+1,1) = (2,1)\n> \n> (2,1) is empty? Let's see if it's a valid move.\n> \n> From the positions, (2,1) is not listed, so it should be free, and not a wall.\n> \n> Walls are only borders and (6,4), so (2,1) is within bounds: x=2 between 1-6, y=1 between 1-6, not (6,4), so yes, (2,1) is free.\n> \n> But is it adjacent to tail or something? No, tail is at (5,5), far away.\n> \n> So from (1,1), the only possible move without immediate death is Right to (2,1).\n> \n> Up: (1,2) is body segment, so if head moves there, it collides with body.\n> \n> Down: (1,0) is wall.\n> \n> Left: (0,1) is wall.\n> \n> Right: (2,1) is empty.\n> \n> So for turn 40, the only choice is to move Right to (2,1).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), what next?\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Turn 40: Move R to (2,1)\n> \n> New head position: (2,1)\n> \n> Then the body: the segment that was at (1,1) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and tail (5,5) is removed? When snake moves, the tail is removed unless it eats food.\n> \n> No food eaten, so tail is removed, and the new body is from the old positions minus tail.\n> \n> Old positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] 11 segments.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), new head at (2,1), then the first body segment is the old head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and the tail (5,5) is gone, so new positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 11 segments still? Let's count: head (2,1), then 10 body segments from old: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). That's 11 positions, but tail was (5,5), now removed, so the last segment is (5,4).\n> \n> Old positions had 11 segments: indices 0 to 10.\n> \n> After move: new head at new position, then old head to old tail-1, but since no growth, tail is removed.\n> \n> So new body: old positions [0] to [9], but [0] is old head, which becomes the first body segment.\n> \n> New positions: [new head] + old positions [0] to [9] except that [0] is included.\n> \n> Standard way: new head position, then all old positions except the last one (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for 11 segments, after move without eating, it should have 11 segments still?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when food eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is the old tail position.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions, and the tail remains at the old tail position for this move, so the new body has one more segment.\n> \n> For example, before move, 11 segments: head and 10 body?

No.\n> \n> The new body includes the old positions, and the tail stays, so the list becomes: new head (4,6), then new body: old head (4,5), then old body1 (4,4), old body2 (4,3), ..., old body10 (2,3), and since tail doesn't move, (2,3) is still there, but it's now the second last, and a new tail segment is added at (2,3), but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard way: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to new cell (food), tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is at the food cell, the new first body is the old head position, and so on, up to the old tail position, which is now the second last body segment, and the new tail is the same position as the old tail (since it didn't move), but that means two segments at same position? No.\n> \n> After eating, the head is at food cell, the body includes the old head position and all old body positions, so the number of segments increases by one.\n> \n> For example, before: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P10 (tail)\n> \n> After eating at new cell C: new head at C, new body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P10, so new positions: C, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10, with new tail at P10.\n> \n> So 12 segments.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (4,6): new head (4,6), new body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) with tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Then the snake is longer.\n> \n> But for now, it's fine.\n> \n> Back to the plan.\n> \n> So at turn 47, I eat (4,6) by moving U to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, what about the other food (1,5)?\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), life span 6, available until turn 46.\n> \n> At turn 47, it's gone, since life span 6, disappears at turn 47.\n> \n> Life span 6 at turn 41, so available turns 41,42,43,44,45,46, disappears turn 47.\n> \n> At turn 46, where is the head?\n> \n> In the sequence above, at turn 46 head is at (4,5), which is not (1,5), and I can't reach (1,5) in one move from there.\n> \n> From earlier positions, at turn 46 head at (4,5), (1,5) is at distance |1-4| + |5-5| = 3, not reachable.\n> \n> If I want to eat (1,5), I need to go left earlier.\n> \n> But from turn 43 head at (4,1), I went U to (4,2), then U to (4,3), etc., all right and up.\n> \n> To go to (1,5), I need to go left from (4,1) or something, but I can't because direction is R, and L forbidden.\n> \n> At turn 43, from (4,1), I could go U to (4,2), then at turn 44, from (4,2) I could go L to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied at that time.\n> \n> At turn 43 end, positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n> \n> (3,2) is position 9, occupied, so moving to (3,2) at turn 44 would collide.\n> \n> If I go R to (5,2) at turn 44, then I'm going right, not left.\n> \n> So it seems difficult to reach (1,5) in time, since from (4,1) at turn 43, to (1,5) is |1-4| + |5-1| = 3+4=7 cells, and only 4 turns left (turn 43,44,45,46) but I need to move the head, so from turn 43 position (4,1), after turn 43 move, head at new position, say (4,2) or (5,1), then to (1,5) in 3 moves?

So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where blocked.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. So grid is 6x6: (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,1), and direction is right (R), so moving east.\n> \n> Body segments: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then (2,1)\n> \n> - (1,1)\n> \n> - (1,2) — this is a turn\n> \n> - (1,3)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (2,2) — another turn\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,3) — tail\n> \n> The snake has 11 segments. Head at (3,1), tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> 1. (6,3) with value 1, life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 42, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 43? Let's think.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after (t + L - 1) or something? Better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> Rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,3): life span 2 at turn 42. So after turn 42, countdown becomes 1. After turn 43, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 42 or 43, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods:\n> \n> - (1,5) value 1, life span 5. So at turn 42, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 46? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 42: life span 5, countdown starts at 5.\n> \n> After turn 42: countdown 4\n> \n> After turn 43: countdown 3\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 46: countdown 0, disappears. So can be eaten from turn 42 to 46 inclusive.\n> \n> - (4,6) value 1, life span 8. Disappears after turn 49.\n> \n> All foods have value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 42.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot instant reverse.

But let's check if it's a wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (6,4).\n> \n> (4,1): x=4, y=1. y=1 is not border (since y=0 and y=7 are walls, y=1 is inside), similarly x=4 between 1 and 6. Not (6,4), so free.\n> \n> But is there food? Foods are at (6,3), (1,5), (4,6). None at (4,1).\n> \n> So move R to (4,1) should be safe, no collision.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food, which it doesn't here.\n> \n> Now, move U: from (3,1) to (3,2). But (3,2) is occupied by snake body! (3,2) is the 8th segment? Positions: index from head: 0: (3,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (1,1), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), yes, (3,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,2), it collides with body, death.\n> \n> So move U is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Move D: from (3,1) to (3,0). But y=0 is wall, so wall collision, death. Invalid.\n> \n> Move L: but cannot, reverse direction, current is R, so L not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (4,1)? But U and D are invalid, L not allowed, so only R is possible?\n> \n> But let's confirm.\n> \n> Current head (3,1), move R to (4,1): (4,1) not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> But after moving, the tail moves, so the cell (5,3) is vacated, but head is at (4,1), not affecting tail.\n> \n> Now, for turn 42, I need to choose an action, but I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence starting from turn 42 for several turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, think long-term.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their positions and life spans.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 2 at turn 42.

Let's plot:\n> \n> At y=1: x=1,2,3,4 occupied: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) head\n> \n> At y=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> At y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Row y=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) head\n> \n> - Row y=2: cells (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> - Row y=3: cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> And (2,2) is occupied, (2,3) occupied, etc.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,3): x=6, y=3, value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n> \n> - (1,5): x=1, y=5, value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,6): x=4, y=6, value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,5): x=6, y=5, value 1, life span 10\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, current head at (4,1), direction R.

From snake positions, (4,2) is not listed; in y=2, we have (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), no (4,2), so (4,2) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is not occupied, since snake is at x=1,2,3,4 at y=1, so (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So (4,2) is not occupied, free.\n> \n> (5,1) not occupied.\n> \n> Now, food: no food at (4,2) or (5,1), so moving to empty cells.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate turn: turn 43.\n> \n> I need to choose action for turn 43.\n> \n> Options: U or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (4,2), that is free.\n> \n> If I go R to (5,1), free.\n> \n> Now, consequences.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,3) with life span 1, meaning if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life span is 1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So to eat it, I must be at (6,3) at the end of this turn.\n> \n> But head is at (4,1), and (6,3) is two moves away: I need to go right then up, or up then right, but not in one move. From (4,1), I can only move to adjacent cells, so (6,3) is not reachable in one move. Distance: dx=2, dy=2, so Manhattan distance 4, not adjacent. So I cannot eat (6,3) this turn; it will disappear after this turn no matter what. So I should ignore it since it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 43, so if not eaten on turn 43, it vanishes. Since I can't reach it in one move, it's impossible to eat, so forget about it.\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,5) life span 4, so available for turns 43,44,45,46; disappears after turn 46.\n> \n> (4,6) life span 7, available turns 43 to 49.\n> \n> (6,5) life span 10, available longer.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current head (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> After move, the snake moves, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two options for turn 43.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (4,2)\n> \n> Then head to (4,2), which is free. Then direction becomes U.\n> \n> Snake positions: new head (4,2), then the previous head (4,1) becomes body, so body segments: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail (4,3) moves away? When head moves, the tail end moves off, so the last segment is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail moves. Tail is at (4,3), so it moves, meaning the snake shortens? No: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving U to (4,2):\n> \n> New positions: head (4,2), then previous positions except tail removed. Original positions: index 0: (4,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (1,1), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3)\n> \n> After move: head to (4,2), then body: the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was, but in the list, the new body is the old head, then old body.\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the old head (4,1)\n> \n> Then old body: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> And the tail (4,3) is removed, so no longer part of snake.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]? Let's count: positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). That's 11 segments, but tail was removed, so it should be 10 segments? Mistake.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the length stays the same, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> The snake has 11 segments. When head moves to a new cell, a new head is added there, and the tail cell is vacated. So the new positions are: the new head position, followed by all previous positions except the tail is removed. Since the tail is removed, the snake has the same number of segments.\n> \n> Start with N segments. After move: new head at new position, then the first N-1 segments of the previous snake become the body, so the last segment (tail) is gone.\n> \n> Previous snake: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P10, 11 positions.\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new:\n> \n> New snake: [H_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P9]  because P10 is removed.\n> \n> P0 was head, P1 to P9 are body, P10 tail removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [H_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9]  that's 11 positions?

So it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 44, it will disappear after turn 47? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it has N turns left including the current one. For example, if life span is 4 on turn 44, it can be eaten on turns 44, 45, 46, 47, and disappears after turn 47 or before turn 48? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So on turn 44, with life span 4, it has 4 turns left: it can be eaten on turn 44, 45, 46, or 47.

The segment before tail is (1,3), which moves to (2,3)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (2,1), 7: (1,1), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,3), 10: tail (2,3)\n> \n> After moving Up to (4,6):\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (4,4)) moves to (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (4,3)) moves to (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (4,2)) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (4,1)) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (3,1)) moves to (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (2,1)) moves to (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (1,1)) moves to (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was at (1,2)) moves to (1,1)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was at (1,3)) moves to (1,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10 tail (was at (2,3)) moves to (1,3)\n> \n> Now, the new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n> \n> Is head at (4,6) colliding with any body? Body positions: (4,5), (4,4), etc. (4,6) is not in the body positions yet; (4,5) is body now, but head is at (4,6), so no collision.\n> \n> Also, walls: (4,6) is y=6, which is not wall; walls are y=7, so safe.\n> \n> So moving Up to eat food at (4,6) is possible and safe, and we get +3 score, and snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But after eating, when we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if we eat at (4,6), since it's positive food, snake grows: head moves to (4,6), and we add a new segment, so the tail stays in place, but since we ate food, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> General rule: when snake eats positive food, length increases, so after moving head to food, the tail does not move, thus snake grows by one.\n> \n> If not eating food, tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, we are eating food, so after move to (4,6), head at (4,6), and since we ate food, the tail remains, so the new tail position is the same as before, but the body extends.\n> \n> Specifically: positions: new head at (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes new segment 1, then previous segment 1 (4,4) becomes segment 2, and so on, down to tail, which was at (2,3), but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so segment 10 is still at (2,3)? No.\n> \n> Let's think: after eating, the snake grows, so the tail position remains, and we add a new segment at the tail.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when food is eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions: head at new position, then all body segments shift, but the last segment stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves forward to the food cell. Then, since food is eaten, we don't remove the tail segment, so the snake gains one segment. The tail remains where it was, and the segment before tail moves to its new position, etc.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> After moving and eating: new head at new position, B1 moves to old H, B2 to old B1, ..., Bk to old B_{k-1}, and T remains, so now the body has one more segment: H_new, old H, old B1, ..., old Bk, T\n> \n> T remains fixed.\n> \n> In this case, before move: head (4,5), B1 (4,4), B2 (4,3), B3 (4,2), B4 (4,1), B5 (3,1), B6 (2,1), B7 (1,1), B8 (1,2), B9 (1,3), T (2,3)  -- 11 segments.\n> \n> After moving Up to (4,6) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - B1 new: old head (4,5)\n> \n> - B2 new: old B1 (4,4)\n> \n> - B3 new: old B2 (4,3)\n> \n> - B4 new: old B3 (4,2)\n> \n> - B5 new: old B4 (4,1)\n> \n> - B6 new: old B5 (3,1)\n> \n> - B7 new: old B6 (2,1)\n> \n> - B8 new: old B7 (1,1)\n> \n> - B9 new: old B8 (1,2)\n> \n> - B10 new: old B9 (1,3)  -- since we ate, we add a new segment, so B10 is old B9\n> \n> - T new: old T (2,3)  -- tail remains at (2,3)\n> \n> Now the snake has 12 segments: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,3) are both there, but (2,3) is the tail.\n> \n> No collision at head.\n> \n> But we have to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> After this move, all other food disappears since life span 1, not eaten.\n> \n> But there might be new food spawning later, but we don't know, so we have to explore the board for safety.\n> \n> Now, current turn t=47, we move Up to (4,6).\n> \n> Then for future turns, we need to plan.\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n> \n> The answer format: Action sequence for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to say t1+5 or more.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead in planning, but the sequence might not be fixed, but for output, we provide a sequence based on the plan.\n> \n> Since future food is not known, we have to assume no new food for now, and just survive, but we should consider the current state and possible paths.\n> \n> After moving to (4,6), head at (4,6), direction now Up, since we moved U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U to (4,7): y=7 is wall, since border y=7, so cannot move Up, out of bounds.\n> \n> D to (4,5): but (4,5) is now occupied by the first body segment, B1 at (4,5), so moving down would be to body, collision, and also instant reverse? Current direction after move is U, so moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So cannot move D.\n> \n> L to (3,6): is (3,6) free? Currently, after move, positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc., (3,6) not occupied, and no wall. y=6 is not wall, x=3,y=6.\n> \n> Walls: internal (6,4), not (3,6).

For example, if we don't eat, we move to (3,5) or (5,5), but then all food disappears, and we get no score, and snake doesn't grow, but we survive, but we miss the opportunity to eat and grow, which might be bad for long-term if we need to navigate tight spaces.\n> \n> But with growth, we have a longer snake, harder to maneuver.\n> \n> But in this case, eating gives +3 and growth, which might be useful.\n> \n> But let's see the board.\n> \n> After eating, snake is longer, positions from (4,6) to (2,3), with body in between.\n> \n> Now, from (4,6), we can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n> \n> Say we move L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then head to (3,6), no food, so tail moves: the last segment at (2,3) moves to new position.\n> \n> After move to (3,6), not eating, so head to (3,6), B1 to (4,6)?

It's turn 48. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead,\" I should plan for multiple moves to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. Walls are at all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries are solid. Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,6), direction U, so it just moved up to (4,6) from (4,5), I assume. Positions list: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]. So the tail is at (2,3), and it's a bit coiled.\n> \n> Let me sketch this grid mentally. Rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in grids, y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary. Here, since head is at (4,6) and direction U, which is y+1, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - y=7: top wall\n> \n> - y=0: bottom wall\n> \n> - x=0: left wall\n> \n> - x=7: right wall\n> \n> - Obstacle at (6,4)\n> \n> Snake head at (4,6).

Let's see: on turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone? But \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so at turn t, countdown is N, then turn t+1, it's N-1, ..., turn t + N -1, countdown=1, then on turn t + N, it disappears, so not available on turn t + N.\n> \n> But for eating, we can eat on turn when countdown >=1, I think.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2), life span 8, so disappears after turn 55?

Can it move there? Body collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, it's deadly. Here, (4,5) is the segment right behind head, so moving down to (4,5) would mean head collides with body immediately.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (2,3).

So at turn 50, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including turn 50. After turn 50, it has 3 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,5) with life span 4 on turn 50:\n> \n> - Turn 50: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 51: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 52: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 53: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 54: countdown 0, disappears?

But the rule says \"after N turns\", which might include the current turn or not.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if countdown is k, it decreases to k-1 during the turn, and if it reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> To simplify, since we're planning actions, I should consider when it vanishes.\n> \n> Assume that for food with life span L on turn T, it will be present until the end of turn T + L - 1, and disappears at the start of turn T + L.\n> \n> For example, life span 4 on turn 50:\n> \n> - Turn 50: present, countdown 4\n> \n> - After turn 50, countdown becomes 3\n> \n> - Turn 51: present, countdown 3\n> \n> - After turn 51, countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 52: present, countdown 2\n> \n> - After turn 52, countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 53: present, countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 53, countdown 0, disappears, so not present on turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,2) life span 6 on turn 50: present until after turn 55 (since 50+6-1=55, disappears at turn 56)\n> \n> Turn 50: L=6, after turn 50: L=5\n> \n> Turn 51: L=5, after turn 51: L=4\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 55: L=1, after turn 55: L=0, disappears, so not on turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,4) L=9: present until after turn 58, disappears at turn 59.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (2,6), I can go to (2,5) down or (1,6) left.\n> \n> I need to evaluate which one is better for long-term survival and eating food.\n> \n> Also, there's a food at (2,4) which is close, but life span 9, so not urgent.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) with life span 6, and (6,5) with life span 4, which is short, so I might want to eat that soon.\n> \n> But (6,5) is far, at (6,5), and I'm at (2,6), so distance is |6-2| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5 Manhattan distance, but with obstacles and snake body, it might take more turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is at (3,2), I'm at (2,6), distance |3-2| + |2-6| =1 +4=5.\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), distance |2-2| + |4-6| =0+2=2, very close.\n> \n> But eating (2,4) might be tricky because it's near the snake body.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid to see positions.\n> \n> I'll make a simple grid representation.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top or top to bottom?

So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't move to those cells. There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). The head direction is Down, which is decreasing y, since y=5 to y=6 would be up? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases downwards, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). Let's see: U: (x,y+1) – that might mean up if y=0 is top, but usually in programming, y=0 is top and y increases down. But here, U is (x,y+1), which if y+1, it might be moving down if y increases down? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – so if y increases upwards, this would be up, but often in games, y increases downwards. Let's look at the state.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is Down. Current head position is (2,5). Previous positions: the snake was moving down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), so from (2,6) to (2,5) – that's decreasing y, so if y=6 to y=5, y decreased, so Down means decreasing y. Similarly, U would be increasing y.\n> \n> Confirm with direction: head direction is D, and it came from (2,6) to (2,5), so from y=6 to y=5, y decreased by 1, so D is (x,y-1), meaning down if we think y=0 bottom or top? But in terms of coordinates, it doesn't matter; we just need to know the deltas.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – moving to higher y\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) – moving to lower y\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) – left\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) – right\n> \n> In the grid, with walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably the bottom or top? But for movement, we don't care about orientation, just the values.\n> \n> Current head at (2,5), direction D, so last move was down to (2,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> 1. (6,5) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> 2. (3,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> 3. (2,4) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5) it's 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 51, life span is 3, so it will be gone by turn 54? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (6,5), life_span=3 at turn 51, so:\n> \n> - Turn 51: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 52: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 53: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 54: life_span=0, disappears\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): life_span=5 at turn 51, so disappears after turn 55 (since turn 51:5, 52:4, 53:3, 54:2, 55:1, 56:0? Disappears after N turns, so if life_span=N at turn t, it lasts until turn t + N - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life_span is N. After each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? But for eating, it can be eaten as long as life_span >0 when head moves to it.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it is present, it can be eaten.\n> \n> For example, (6,5) with life_span=3 at turn 51. On turn 51, it is present. After turn 51, life_span becomes 2 for turn 52, and so on. After turn 53, life_span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 54? I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, L decreases by 1. If L=1 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is L at turn t, it means it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, inclusive. After turn t+L-1, it is removed.\n> \n> For (6,5): L=3 at turn 51, so exists on turns 51,52,53. Disappears before turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): L=5, exists turns 51 to 55.\n> \n> (2,4): L=8, exists turns 51 to 58.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), direction D (down, so y-1).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (2,6)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (2,4)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (1,5)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (3,5)\n> \n> But need to check for collisions and also the no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse. U is (x,y+1), which is increasing y, so if D is decreasing y, U is opposite, so yes, cannot move U.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is D, so opposite is U. So cannot move U.\n> \n> Also, check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,5) is x=1,y=5, not wall. (2,6) is y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y from 0 to 7, cells y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are ok except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4)\n> \n> So for possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: (2,6) – but cannot because reverse direction, and also let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> First, is (2,6) occupied? Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6) is the second segment? Positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), ...] so (2,6) is occupied by the body. If I move to (2,6), that's the body segment, so collision.\n> \n> Snake body: segments are (2,6), (3,6), etc. So (2,6) is the first body segment after head.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,6), it would collide with the body there.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (2,4) – is this occupied? Snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), etc. (2,4) is not in the list. Positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).

Snake positions: last segment is (1,1), so tail is at (1,1).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (2,5), tail at (1,1). Distance: |2-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (2,5) and (1,1) are not adjacent.\n> \n> Moreover, (2,4) is where the food is, not the tail position.\n> \n> The rule is about the tail cell having food and head adjacent to tail when eating.\n> \n> Here, food is at (2,4), which is not the tail.

But old index 11 is (2,1), which was body, now it's the last, and old tail (1,1) removed, so we have 13 positions but the last is (2,1), and the new head (3,4), so length is 13, but since no food eaten, length should be 12. Contradiction.\n> \n> I think I confused the indexing.\n> \n> Let's think of the list as having the head at position 0, then body segments 1 to k, then tail at end.\n> \n> When moving with no food: the head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head. Then, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. Specifically, the new body segment 1 is the old head position, new body segment 2 is the old body segment 1 position, and so on, up to the tail. The old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, there are L cells occupied.\n> \n> After move with no food: the new head is at a new cell, the new body segment i is at the old position of body segment i-1 for i from 1 to L-1, and the new tail is at the old position of body segment L-1?

So the last position is (2,1), which was S11, and S12 removed, so new tail is (2,1), length 13? New list has 13 positions: new head and S0 to S11, which is 12 +1 =13, but S0 to S11 is 12 items, plus new head, 13 positions, but L was 13, after no eat, it should be 13? No, with no eat, length should stay the same, but it was 13, after move no eat, it should be 13, but the tail moved, so the old tail cell is free, new tail is the previous body segment.\n> \n> In this case, new positions have 13 cells, but one is new head, and the old head is now body, etc., so length remains 13.

Snake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). That's 13 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is towards decreasing y, since D is (x,y-1).

But (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions, (4,4) is the 7th segment: positions are index 0: head (2,4), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), etc. So (4,4) is occupied by the snake, and food is there? But the food is listed as (4,4,10,1), so there is food at (4,4) with life span 10.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\" So since the snake is on (4,4), the food is under it, but to eat it, the body must move away first, meaning that segment leaves (4,4), and then the head moves there.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.

(2,5) is the second segment, so if I move up, head goes to (2,5), which is occupied, so collision. Similarly, moving left to (1,4): is (1,4) occupied? Snake positions: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc. (1,4) is not in the list, so it should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable, y=1 to 6.

Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 52, life span is 2, meaning after turn 52, it has 1 turn left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now. So if N=2, it will be there for turn 52 and 53, and disappear at the start of turn 54 or something. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps on turn t, with life span L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But for movement, when we move, we eat food if head moves onto it at the end of the turn.\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn, we decide action, then move, then if head is on food, eat it, then food life span decreases.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify, but for simplicity, I think: at the start of turn, food has life span, after movement, if head eats food, snake grows, then for all food, life span decreases by 1, and if life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,5) with life span 2 on turn 52: during turn 52, if head moves there, it can be eaten, then after eating, life span would decrease to 1? But it's eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Life span decrease happens after the turn, I think.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's think: the food is present for L turns, including the current turn. So for L=2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after that.\n> \n> For (6,5) at turn 52, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 52 or 53. After turn 53, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life span 4, can be eaten on turns 52,53,54,55.\n> \n> (4,4) life span 10, many turns, but it's under snake body.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, from current position (2,4), head direction down.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 52: since cannot reverse up, can go Down, Left, or Right.\n> \n> - Down to (2,3)\n> \n> - Left to (1,4)\n> \n> - Right to (3,4)\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each option with long-term survival and food in mind.\n> \n> Also, the grid: snake body is from (2,4) to (1,1), so it's coiled around the bottom-left area.\n> \n> Specifically, from head (2,4) down to (2,3)?

(1,4) is free, (3,4) is free.\n> \n> (3,4) is not in positions, but let's list all occupied cells: from snake: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So 13 cells.\n> \n> Free cells: all others in 6x6 grid except walls and obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7 are out of bounds, so not playable. Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (6,4).\n> \n> Total cells: 6x6=36 minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells. Snake occupies 13, so 22 free cells.\n> \n> Food at (6,5), (3,2), (4,4) but (4,4) occupied.\n> \n> Now, for turn 52 actions:\n> \n> Option 1: Move Down to (2,3)\n> \n> Then head at (2,3), direction down.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3), cannot up because reverse, but head direction now down, so cannot up.\n> \n> (2,2) is free? Not in snake positions, so yes.\n> \n> (1,3) free? Not listed, yes.\n> \n> (3,3) free? Not listed.\n> \n> But (3,2) has food, which is below (3,3)? (3,2) is south of (3,3).\n> \n> After moving to (2,3), I can go to (3,3) or other places.\n> \n> But let's think about food.\n> \n> Food (3,2) is at y=2, x=3.\n> \n> From (2,3), I can go right to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat it.\n> \n> Life span 4, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (4,4) has food under body, so I need to free that cell first.\n> \n> (6,5) has short life span, only 2 turns left, meaning it can be eaten on turn 52 or 53, else disappears.\n> \n> If I go for (6,5), it's at (6,5), which is near the top-right.\n> \n> From (2,4), to go to (6,5), it's a bit far.\n> \n> Distance: delta x = 4, delta y = 1, so at least 5 moves, but with snake body, it might be risky.\n> \n> Since life span 2, I need to reach it by turn 53.\n> \n> Turn 52: I move towards it.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,4) on turn 52.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), but (4,4) has food but is occupied by body. If I go to (4,4) now, I would collide because body is there.\n> \n> Positions: head at (2,4), if I move right to (3,4), then the body moves: the tail moves away from (1,1), and each segment moves forward.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> After moving right to (3,4), the new positions: head at (3,4), then the old head (2,4) becomes body, so body: (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n> \n> (4,4) is still occupied by the 7th segment? After move, positions: head (3,4), then segments: 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,3), etc. So (4,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) is under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> If I move to (4,4) now, I hit the body at (4,4), collision.\n> \n> So I cannot move directly to (4,4) until the snake moves away from it.\n> \n> Similarly, for other cells.\n> \n> So for (4,4) food, I need to wait for the body to leave that cell.\n> \n> Currently, (4,4) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (4,5), I think. When the snake moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,1). When I move, the tail moves to the next position, depending on the direction.\n> \n> The snake moves one step, so the tail segment is removed, and a new head is added.\n> \n> So when I move, the cell that was tail is vacated, and the head occupies a new cell.\n> \n> For (4,4), which is not the tail, it will move when the snake moves, but it might not vacate immediately.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,4) is the 7th segment from head, so it will take several moves for it to be vacated.\n> \n> The segment at (4,4) will move to the position of the previous segment when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, when I move from (2,4) to (3,4), the body segments shift: the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions: before move: [H: (2,4), B1: (2,5), B2: (2,6), B3: (3,6), B4: (4,6), B5: (4,5), B6: (4,4), B7: (4,3), B8: (4,2), B9: (4,1), B10: (3,1), B11: (2,1), B12: (1,1)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4): new head (3,4), then B1: old head (2,4), B2: old B1 (2,5), B3: old B2 (2,6), B4: old B3 (3,6), B5: old B4 (4,6), B6: old B5 (4,5), B7: old B6 (4,4), B8: old B7 (4,3), B9: old B8 (4,2), B10: old B9 (4,1), B11: old B10 (3,1), B12: old B11 (2,1), and tail old B12 (1,1) is removed, so (1,1) is vacated.\n> \n> So after move, positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So (4,4) is still occupied, by B7 now.\n> \n> The food at (4,4) is under the body, so it can't be eaten yet.\n> \n> To free (4,4), I need the segment that is there to move away, which will happen when the snake moves enough times that that segment is the tail and moves off.\n> \n> But (4,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (2,1) after this move.\n> \n> The segment at (4,4) is the 8th from head or something, so it will take many moves to become the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, the snake has 13 segments, so the segment at position k from head will be tail after k moves, but since the tail moves, it's not that simple.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail is removed, so each move, one body segment is \"released\" when it becomes the tail.\n> \n> But for a specific cell, like (4,4), it is occupied by a body segment that will move to a different cell when the snake moves, but the cell (4,4) might be occupied by different segments over time.\n> \n> To vacate the cell (4,4), I need that no body segment is on it when the head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, after any move, as long as that body segment is not the tail, (4,4) might still be occupied if the segment moves to it or stays, but in this case, the body is moving, so the occupant of (4,4) changes.\n> \n> For example, if I move the snake, the segment that was at (4,4) might move to (4,5) or something, depending on the movement.\n> \n> In the current configuration, the body is relatively static in that area, but as the snake moves, it will shift.\n> \n> To free (4,4), since it's occupied by a body segment, I need that segment to move away from (4,4) when the snake moves.\n> \n> For instance, if I move in a way that the body at (4,4) moves to a different cell.\n> \n> From the current positions, the segment at (4,4) is connected to (4,5) and (4,3), so it might move to (4,3) or (4,5) depending on the head movement.\n> \n> But it's not direct; the movement is determined by the head.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to simulate the body shift.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, and the food at (4,4) has long life span (10), I can ignore it for now and focus on other food.\n> \n> The critical food is (6,5) with life span 2, so I need to eat it soon or lose it.\n> \n> (3,2) has life span 4, so more time.\n> \n> (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near the top-right corner.\n> \n> From head at (2,4), to reach (6,5), I need to go east and north, but y=5 is north of y=4? y decreases down, so y=5 is above y=4.\n> \n> Grid: y=1 bottom, y=6 top, I assume, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is south, y=6 is north.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), with U (y+1), D (y-1), so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down.\n> \n> So (2,4) to (6,5): delta x +4, delta y +1, so I need to go right 4 times and up once, but not necessarily in that order.\n> \n> Minimum 5 moves, but with body, I need a path.\n> \n> Available moves from (2,4): D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n> \n> If I go right to (3,4) on turn 52, then from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), but (4,4) has body, so collision if I go there.\n> \n> From (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body, so collision, cannot, R to (4,4) body, collision, so only U or D.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction: after moving right, head direction is R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n> \n> From (3,4), after moving R to there, head direction R, so can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> But R to (4,4) is occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> U to (3,5): is (3,5) free?

It's turn 53, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly for y. So it's a 6x6 playable area? No:\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that's 6x6, but positions are given like (2,3), so min x=1, max x=6? Snake positions include (2,1), which is y=1, and walls at y=0, so y=1 is playable. Similarly, (4,1) is given, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 units, so 6x6 grid.\n> \n> But there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). So (6,4) is a wall cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,3), and direction is D, which is down. So moving down.\n> \n> List the snake body: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), and since direction is down, it was moving down to (2,3) from (2,2) or something? Let's see the positions: the list is head first, so (2,3) is head, then (2,4) is the next segment, which is above it? y=4 is higher y, so if y increases up, then (2,4) is north of (2,3)? But direction is down, which is decreasing y, I assume.\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Since (2,6) has y=6, which is near the top wall y=7? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is top? y=0 bottom? U is (x,y+1), so if y=0 is bottom, y+1 is up, so y increases as we go up.\n> \n> Confirm with walls: border y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So for point (x,y), U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Since y=4,5,6 are increasing, and head at y=3, so the body is above the head. Direction is D, down, so from previous position, it was at (2,2) or something? The positions list: (2,3) is head, then (2,4) is segment behind, which is at higher y, so north of head. But head is moving down, to (2,3), so it came from (2,4)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion. The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So head is first: (2,3). Then next segment is (2,4), which is directly above it since y=4 > y=3. Then (2,5) above that, then (2,6) above that. Then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1).\n> \n> Direction is D, down. So if the head is at (2,3) and moving down, that means it is going to (2,2) or something. But the current position is (2,3), and direction is the current moving direction.\n> \n> At turn 53, the snake has just moved to (2,3) with direction D, so from where? The previous position must have been (2,4) or something, but (2,4) is still part of the body.\n> \n> Let's think about the movement. When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each segment follows, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> At the start of turn 53, the snake is at these positions, and head direction is D, meaning it is facing down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up, because no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so cannot move U next.\n> \n> From head (2,3), possible moves: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3). Cannot move U to (2,4) because that's opposite to current direction D.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life_span 1?

Let me check the core rules.\n> \n> In food mechanics, positive food +1, negative food -1. But here value is given as 1 and 3? (6,5,1,1) value=1, and (3,2,3,1) value=3? But it should be +1 or -1 for value.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\": ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) etc.\n> \n> For (6,5,1,1) it might be (x,y,value,life_span) so (6,5), value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> Similarly (3,2,3,1) value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> And (4,4,9,1) value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> But core rules say positive food +1, negative -1. Here we have value 1,3,9? That doesn't match.\n> \n> Perhaps \"value\" here is the reward, but it can be different? But the rules say positive food +1, negative -1. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> In the core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\"\n> \n> But in the state input, for food, it's given with value and life span, so value can be positive or negative, but in this case, all values are positive: 1,3,9.\n> \n> (6,5,1,1) value=1, (3,2,3,1) value=3, (4,4,9,1) value=9. All positive, so all are positive food, I assume. Value 3 and 9 are higher rewards? But rules say +1 for positive, but here it's specified as value, so I think we should take the value as given. Probably, the value can be different, not just +1 or -1.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food, but in the state, it's given with specific values, so I think for this game, the value is as specified, not fixed to +1.\n> \n> Similarly, life span is given.\n> \n> Also, for (4,4,9,1), but (4,4) is a snake body position? Snake positions include (4,4), which is a body segment.\n> \n> Let's list all cells.\n> \n> First, playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls at borders and internal (6,4).\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4) is a wall, so not playable.\n> \n> Now, snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,3)\n> \n> Body: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,5): value=1, life_span=1, so disappears after 1 turn, meaning if not eaten on this turn (turn 53), it will be gone. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 53, life_span=1, after turn 53, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so must be eaten on turn 53 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): value=3, life_span=1, so must be eaten on turn 53 or gone.\n> \n> (4,4): value=9, life_span=1, must be eaten on turn 53 or gone.\n> \n> But (4,4) is currently occupied by a snake body segment. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (4,4), it's a body segment, so to eat it, we need the snake to move so that (4,4) is no longer occupied, and then head moves there.\n> \n> But life_span=1, so it must be eaten on this turn or it disappears. But on this turn, (4,4) is occupied, so the body is there, so we can't eat it this turn because the head can't move to (4,4) while it's occupied.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food to be eaten, the cell must be free when head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently at turn 53, (4,4) has food, but it's occupied by body, so if we move such that the snake moves away from (4,4), then on the next turn, if head moves to (4,4), we can eat it. But life_span=1, and it decreases on this turn, so after turn 53, it disappears. So we cannot eat it at all, because on turn 53, it's occupied, so we can't move head there, and after turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns (N=life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span = L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1, I think.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose food appears at turn T with life_span L.\n> \n> Then, it exists for L turns: from turn T to turn T+L-1, and disappears at turn T+L.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn when it appears.\n> \n> For example, at turn T, life_span = L, countdown L.\n> \n> After turn T, at start of turn T+1, life_span = L-1.\n> \n> After turn T+1, life_span = L-2, and so on, until life_span = 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So the food can be eaten on any turn from T to T+L-1.\n> \n> In this case, for all food, life_span=1, and current turn is 53.\n> \n> So for (6,5,1,1): life_span=1 at turn 53, so it can be eaten on turn 53 only. After turn 53, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2,3,1): can be eaten on turn 53 only.\n> \n> For (4,4,9,1): life_span=1, can be eaten on turn 53 only, but it is currently occupied by snake body at (4,4), so we cannot eat it on turn 53 because the cell is occupied and head cannot move there. Therefore, this food is impossible to eat; it will disappear after this turn without being eaten.\n> \n> So for (4,4) food, since it's under the body and life_span=1, it can't be eaten, so we should ignore it for this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, other food must be eaten now or lost.\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 53: from head (2,3), direction D, so can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3). Cannot move U to (2,4) because reverse.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are free and not wall or body.\n> \n> First, (2,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: head (2,3), body (2,4) to (2,6), then (3,6), etc, down to (2,1). (2,1) is tail, (2,2) is not in the list, so (2,2) should be free? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So (2,2) is not in the list, so it's free.\n> \n> (1,3): x=1, y=3. Walls: border x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable, not wall. Is it occupied? Not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (3,3): similarly, x=3,y=3, not wall, not in snake positions, free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), not relevant here.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, food locations: (6,5) at (6,5), (3,2) at (3,2), and (4,4) at (4,4) but we can't eat it, so ignore.\n> \n> (6,5) is at (6,5), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (2,3), (6,5) is far.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) at (3,2), which is adjacent? Head at (2,3), (3,2) is down-right? (2,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> (2,3) to (3,2) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent are (2,2) down, (1,3) left, (3,3) right, (2,4) up but can't go up.\n> \n> So (3,2) is not adjacent to head; it's at (3,2), which is one down and one right from (2,3)? (2,3) to (3,3) is right, to (2,2) is down, so (3,2) is not directly adjacent; it's a diagonal move, which is not allowed. Only orthogonal moves.\n> \n> So from (2,3), the adjacent cells are (2,2), (1,3), (3,3), (2,4) but (2,4) is body and we can't move there.\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied, so we can't move to (2,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is not reachable in one move from (2,3); it would take at least two moves.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is far away.\n> \n> For turn 53, we can only move to one of the three free cells, none of which have food.\n> \n> But there is food at (3,2), which is close, but not directly reachable.\n> \n> Now, life_span=1 for all, so if we don't eat them on this turn, they disappear.\n> \n> But since none are adjacent, we can't eat any food on turn 53; all will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> For (4,4) food, it's under body, and we can't eat it this turn, so it's gone.\n> \n> So on turn 53, no food can be eaten, regardless of move.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 53, we just need to move to a safe cell.\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead for future turns.\n> \n> First, after moving, the snake will have a new head position, and the tail will move, so some cells might free up.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> After move, the tail will move to the next segment, which is (3,1)? Positions: tail is (2,1), but the segments are ordered from head to tail, so tail is the last one, (2,1).\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail segment is removed, and a new head is added.\n> \n> For example, if we move down to (2,2), then new head is (2,2), body: (2,3) becomes new segment 2, then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), and tail (2,1) is removed, so the new tail is (3,1)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (2,2): new head at (2,2). Then segment 1 moves to old head (2,3), segment 2 to old segment 1 (2,4), and so on, up to segment 12 moves to old segment 11 (3,1), and old segment 12 (2,1) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) tail. Old (2,1) gone, and (3,1) is now tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move left to (1,3): new head (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (3,1), (2,1) removed.\n> \n> New positions: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) tail. (2,1) removed.\n> \n> Move right to (3,3): new head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,4), ..., (3,1), (2,1) removed.\n> \n> New positions: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) tail.\n> \n> Now, for turn 53, since no food can be eaten, we just move to a safe position. But we need to think about future food or risks.\n> \n> There might be new food spawning later, but not specified, so we have to assume that only current food is given, and new food may spawn, but not in the state, so for planning, we have to work with what we have.\n> \n> The state only gives current food, so for future turns, we don't know about new food, so we should focus on survival and positioning for potential food.\n> \n> But there are no other food mentioned, so after this turn, all food will be gone, so we need to survive and wait for new food.\n> \n> But the grid is small, and snake is long, 13 segments, in 6x6 grid, which has 36 cells, snake occupies 13, so 23 free, but with walls and obstacle.\n> \n> Playable cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells. Walls: borders are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle (6,4) is wall, so total playable cells: 36 - 1 = 35? (6,4) is wall, so not playable, so 35 cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies 13 cells, so 22 free cells.\n> \n> After move, depending on direction, tail moves, so one cell freed.\n> \n> For turn 53, we need to choose a move that sets us up for future.\n> \n> But no immediate food, so let's think about the area.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because collision.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (2,1), head at (2,3), not adjacent. After move, if we move down to (2,2), then head at (2,2), tail at (3,1) if we moved down, or (3,1) in other cases.\n> \n> After move down: head (2,2), tail (3,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> After move left: head (1,3), tail (3,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> After move right: head (3,3), tail (3,1), which are at same x, y differ by 2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, to think ahead 5+ turns, we need to simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Since no food now, we should move to avoid dead ends and stay safe.\n> \n> The grid has an internal wall at (6,4), which might block the right side.\n> \n> Let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Label x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, so we can't go there.

It's turn 54. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). So, I should avoid those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,2), then body segments at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail at (3,1). Snake head direction is D, which is down. But since the head is at (2,2) and direction is down, moving down would go to (2,1), but let's check if that's possible.\n> \n> The grid is from x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, I assume, since borders are walls. So coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) is bottom left or top left? Typically in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, that might mean y=0 is bottom or top? Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), etc., up to (2,6), which is near y=7? y=6 is one below y=7, since walls at y=7.

Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up), because U is opposite of D. D is down, U is up, so reverse is not allowed.

Is (1,2) occupied? Not in snake positions, and not wall (walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=1 is fine). But x=0 is wall, so (1,2) should be ok.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,2): (3,2) has food! But (3,2) is not occupied by snake body? Let's see: snake has (3,6), (3,1), but not (3,2). (3,2) is a food position, and not snake body, so moving to (3,2) would eat the food there.\n> \n> But is it safe?

Is it safe? (2,1) not in snake body, not wall. But after moving, the snake will have new head at (2,1), and tail will move? When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,1), I don't eat food, so snake length stays, head moves to (2,1), tail at (3,1) moves away, so the segment that was at (3,1) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,1). After move, if no eat, head moves to new position, all segments shift, so tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (2,3), ..., up to (3,1) is gone?

Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (4,5), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,1), 12: tail (3,1)\n> \n> After moving head to new position without eating: new head at (2,1), then the rest: the segment that was index 0 becomes body, so new position: head (2,1), then body: old index 0: (2,2), then index 1: (2,3), ..., up to index 11: (4,1), and index 12 (tail) is removed. So new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] and tail is (4,1).\n> \n> Now, (4,1) is tail, and (4,2) is second last.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (1,2): head to (1,2), new positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), ..., (4,1)] but tail removed, so [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] tail (4,1)\n> \n> If I move right to (3,2): this has food, so I eat it. Eating positive food, so snake grows: head moves to (3,2), eats food, so new head (3,2), and tail does not move, so new positions: the body segments remain, but a new segment is added at the tail? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So after eating, head moves to new cell, and tail stays where it is, so the snake extends.\n> \n> So for move to (3,2) and eat: new head at (3,2), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, so positions: head (3,2), then body: (2,2), (2,3), ..., up to tail (3,1), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to the new cell, and if no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the rest of the body, and the tail remains, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case: after eating at (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), then previous head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), ..., (4,1), and tail (3,1), and since we ate, tail is not removed, so the snake has one more segment. Old snake had 13 segments: indices 0 to 12.\n> \n> After eating, head to (3,2), then body: old head (2,2), then old body from index 1 to 12, so positions: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) — that's 14 positions, yes.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,2) is eaten, so it's gone.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe to move to (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is not currently occupied by body? Current body positions: from list, (3,2) is not there; we have (3,6) and (3,1), but not (3,2). So moving to (3,2) should be fine, no collision.\n> \n> However, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,1). Head at (2,2). Are they adjacent? (2,2) and (3,1): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so not adjacent horizontally or vertically; adjacent means sharing edge, so same x and |dy|=1 or same y and |dx|=1.\n> \n> (2,2) and (3,1) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right only, not diagonal.\n> \n> So head and tail are not adjacent. Tail is at (3,1), and the food is at (3,2), not on the tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,2), tail at (3,1), so (3,2) is not the tail cell; it's a separate cell with food.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving right to (3,2) seems possible and beneficial since I eat +1 food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there's another food at (4,4) with longer life span.\n> \n> First, let's consider the options for turn 54.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (3,2) - eat food, grow to length 14, head now at (3,2), direction was D, but after move, new direction is R? Head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction is set to the move direction for future no reverse.\n> \n> So if I move R, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Then for next turn, I cannot move L (left), since reverse of R.\n> \n> Option 2: Move D to (2,1) - no eat, head at (2,1), new direction D.\n> \n> Option 3: Move L to (1,2) - no eat, head at (1,2), new direction L.\n> \n> Now, think about future turns.\n> \n> First, the food at (3,2) has life span 3, so it disappears at turn 57. Since we are at turn 54, if I don't eat it now, it will be there for turns 55 and 56 as well, but I might eat it later.\n> \n> But if I can eat it now, why not? But I need to see if there are risks.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,4), life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But let's look at the snake position. The snake is mostly vertical on x=2 from y=2 to y=6, then horizontal from (2,6) to (4,6), down to (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail at (3,1).\n> \n> After moving to (3,2), head at (3,2), body at (2,2), (2,3), etc., and tail at (3,1).\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves: since head direction now R, cannot move L (reverse).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R? Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Head at (3,2), direction R.\n> \n> Cannot move L (opposite).\n> \n> Can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is the current tail position. But after we moved and ate, the positions are different.\n> \n> After eating at (3,2), positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So at turn 55, head at (3,2).\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is the tail, which is occupied.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,1), that would be moving to the tail cell.\n> \n> Is that allowed? In snake, moving to the tail is usually safe because when you move, the tail moves away, so the cell is free, but only if you don't eat.\n> \n> General rule: if you move to a cell that is the current tail, and you don't eat, then when you move there, the tail moves away, so it's empty, no collision.\n> \n> But if you eat, tail doesn't move, so if you move to tail, it might be occupied, but in this case, we are not eating now.\n> \n> At turn 55, if I move to (3,1), which is the tail.\n> \n> (3,1) is occupied by the tail segment now.\n> \n> But when I move the head to (3,1), since I am not eating food (assuming no food there), the tail will move away, so the cell (3,1) is vacated just before head moves there, so it should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, in standard snake, moving to the tail position is safe for that reason.\n> \n> Here, (3,1) has no food mentioned; food is at (3,2) and (4,4), so (3,1) is just tail.\n> \n> So moving to (3,1) should be fine.\n> \n> But let's see the options from (3,2):\n> \n> - Move U to (3,3): (3,3) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,2) head, (2,2), (2,3), ..., (2,6), (3,6), etc. (3,3) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> - Move D to (3,1): (3,1) is tail, but as said, should be safe.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by body? Positions include (4,2), which is a body segment. Index: in new positions, (4,2) is the 11th segment? Positions: 0: (3,2), 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (4,5), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,1), 13: (3,1)\n> \n> So (4,2) is index 11, which is body, not tail. Tail is (3,1) index 13.\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied, so moving to (4,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (2,2) is not possible because direction is R, cannot move L reverse.\n> \n> So from (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): (3,3) free? Not in positions, yes.\n> \n> - D to (3,1): (3,1) is tail, should be ok.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by body, collision, death.\n> \n> So R is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only U or D from (3,2).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction U.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (3,4), etc.\n> \n> If move D to (3,1), head at (3,1), direction D.\n> \n> But (3,1) was tail, so after move, since no eat, tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,1) from (3,2), I don't eat, so head to (3,1), then tail (3,1) was occupied, but when head moves to (3,1), the tail is removed or shifted?\n> \n> At turn 55, positions: head at (3,2), tail at (3,1).\n> \n> Move head to (3,1): since (3,1) is the current tail position, and we move there without eating, then the tail moves away first. So the cell (3,1) is freed, then head moves to it. So no collision.\n> \n> New head at (3,1), and the body segments shift: so new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] and tail (4,1) is removed?

After move, head goes to (4,2), but (4,2) was occupied by a body segment that hasn't moved yet? When head moves, the segments shift.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.

It's turn 56, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those cells are blocked. So the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,1), and direction is D (down). The snake body: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]. Let me list these to understand the shape.\n> \n> Starting from head: (3,1) down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), up to (2,3)? No: positions are head first, so (3,1) is head, moving down to (3,2), then from there to (2,2), which is left, then to (2,3) up, (2,4) up, (2,5) up, (2,6) up, then to (3,6) right, then to (4,6) right, then down to (4,5), down to (4,4), down to (4,3), down to (4,2), down to (4,1). But (4,1) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, food positions: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: (4,4) disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so for (4,4), at turn 56, life span is 6, meaning it will be gone after turn 56 + 5 = 61? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. So at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. So it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (4,4): at turn 56, life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 56 to 61, and disappears at turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): life span 9, can be eaten from turn 56 to 64, disappears at turn 65.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,1), direction down. So from (3,1), moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. Walls are at y=0, so (3,0) is out of bounds, collision.\n> \n> Current direction is D, down. From (3,1), down to (3,0) is wall, so cannot move down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but D is wall, so only L or R? No, movement constraints: I can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. I cannot move up if current is down.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So from direction D, I cannot move U. But D is blocked by wall, so possible moves are L or R.\n> \n> From (3,1), moving left would be to (2,1), moving right to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid.\n> \n> First, (2,1): is it occupied by snake or wall?\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n> \n> (4,1) is the tail, but (2,1) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7; y=0,7. (2,1) is within 1 to 6, so no wall. Internal obstacle at (6,4), not relevant.\n> \n> So (2,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): is it occupied? Snake has (4,1) at the tail. But the tail will move when the snake moves, so moving to (4,1) might be possible if it's the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe, as long as it's not a body part.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is the tail, so moving to (4,1) should be okay; the head moves there, and tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake body: positions are head to tail, so (3,1) head, then (3,2), ... up to (4,1) tail.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail at (4,1) will be vacated.\n> \n> If head moves to (4,1), which is currently tail, after move, head is at (4,1), and the old tail is gone, so it's fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is empty.\n> \n> Now, what about moving up? Current direction is D, opposite is U, so I cannot move up because of no instant reverse. So U is not allowed.\n> \n> Only L or R possible.\n> \n> L: to (2,1)\n> \n> R: to (4,1)\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns to maximize score.\n> \n> Food available: (4,4) and (5,5), both +1.\n> \n> (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake body? Snake has (4,4) in positions: let's see, positions: ... (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), ... so (4,4) is a body segment, not the head or tail directly.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) is on a body segment, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is not occupied, I think. Snake positions don't have (5,5), so it's free.\n> \n> (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which should be within bounds, no wall or obstacle? Walls are borders, internal obstacle at (6,4), so (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,4) has life 6, so must be eaten by turn 61. (5,5) life 9, by turn 64.\n> \n> Turn 56 now.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,1), need to get to food.\n> \n> But also, I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, possible actions this turn: move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,1), then snake positions: head to (2,1), then body: (3,1) becomes new segment 1, then (3,2), (2,2), etc., tail at (4,1) moves off?

No.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed.\n> \n> So if move to (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), then body: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and tail was (4,1) but removed, so tail is now (4,2)?

(6,4) is an obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,1), and the body follows: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3). Let me list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (4,3)\n> \n> That's 14 segments, including the head. The snake length is 14, I think, since positions include head and body.\n> \n> Snake head direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right, to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1 and life span 4. Value is 1, but it says \"value1\" which might be the value, and life_span1. In the input: (4,4,4,1) – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). Let me read: \" (4, 4, 4, 1) \" and in the description it's \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but here it's written as (4,4,4,1), so probably (x,y, life_span, value). But in the text it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" and then \"(4,4,4,1)\" so I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (5,5,7,1) and (5,3,10,1). All have value 1, so all positive food? Value is 1 for all, which is +1.\n> \n> Value: +1 for all, so all are positive food. But life span varies.\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - Food at (5,5): life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - Food at (5,3): life span 10, value +1\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So on turn 58, life span 4 means it disappears after turn 58 + 4 - 1? Life span N: it appears for N turns, and countdown decreases each turn. So if life span is N on turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L more turns? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn. So if life span is L on turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, countdown = L. After turn t, countdown = L-1. After turn t+1, countdown = L-2, ..., after turn t + L - 1, countdown = 0, and then after that turn, it disappears. So the food is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 58:\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 4, so available on turns 58, 59, 60, 61? At turn 58, countdown=4; after turn 58, countdown=3; ... after turn 61, countdown=0, disappears after turn 61. So it can be eaten on turns 58 to 61 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): life span 7, available turns 58 to 64 inclusive.\n> \n> (5,3): life span 10, available turns 58 to 67 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,1), direction R. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because reverse is not allowed? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). So I cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But need to check if these moves are valid, not into wall or body collision.\n> \n> First, check walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Head is at (5,1), which is y=1, so D (down) to (5,0) is invalid, since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> U (up) to (5,2) – y=2 is within 1-6.\n> \n> R (right) to (6,1) – x=6 is within 1-6? x=1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls. x=6 is playable, but there's an internal obstacle at (6,4), but (6,1) is not (6,4), so (6,1) should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle only at (6,4), so (6,1) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Now, body collision: I need to see if moving to a cell occupied by body, except the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,1), body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied by body, and there's food at (4,4), but currently occupied, so cannot eat now.\n> \n> If I move, I need to check where I move to.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: to (5,2)\n> \n> Is (5,2) occupied? Look at positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), ... no (5,2) in the list. (5,2) is not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (6,1)\n> \n> (6,1) is not in the body positions, and not a wall, so safe.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by the first body segment. Moving to (4,1) would collide with body, since it's not the tail. The tail is at (4,3), I think.\n> \n> After moving, the tail moves, but at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it's collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away simultaneously, but in standard snake, when head moves to tail position, it's ok because tail moves forward.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into, because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,3). Positions: last one is (4,3), which is the tail.\n> \n> So, from (5,1), moving L to (4,1): (4,1) is occupied by a body segment, which is not the tail, so it would be collision.\n> \n> Therefore, L is invalid because (4,1) is body and not tail.\n> \n> D is invalid to wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (4,4): life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 61 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (5,5): life span 7, by turn 64\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 10, by turn 67\n> \n> Snake head at (5,1), and I need to eat food.\n> \n> But (4,4) is currently occupied by the body, specifically segment 12 at (4,4). So to eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> First, let's plan a path.\n> \n> I should consider the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot this.\n> \n> List all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Row y=1: (5,1) head, (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> - y=2: (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> - y=3: (2,3), (4,3) tail? Tail is (4,3), but (2,3) is also there.\n> \n> Positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) : vertical on x=2, y=2 to 6\n> \n> - (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) : (3,1) and (3,2) then skip to (3,6)\n> \n> - (4,1), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) : (4,1) then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,1) head\n> \n> And head at (5,1)\n> \n> Food at (4,4) - but occupied, (5,5), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which is not occupied by snake?

After move, the body follows, so positions: new head (6,1), then previous positions except tail removed? Standard snake: when moves, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten yet, so after move, tail is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: 14 segments.\n> \n> After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if move R to (6,1): new head (6,1), then the first body segment moves to old head position (5,1), second to (4,1), and so on, up to the second last to old position of segment before tail, and tail is removed, so (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> Now, for eating food: (4,4) is currently occupied, but if the snake moves such that the body moves away, and head moves to (4,4) when it's free.\n> \n> Since (4,4) has food, and it's occupied, when the body moves away, the food is still there, and if head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,4) is part of the body, so when the snake moves, if the segment at (4,4) moves, it might vacate the cell.\n> \n> Let's see the snake order: positions index 0 head, 1 to 13 body.\n> \n> Segment at (4,4) is position 12, I think.

It's turn 60, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive, but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means if you try to move to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, it's a wall collision. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow. The snake is moving Up, so from (5,3) it came from below, I assume.\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up, so (x,y+1). But current position is (5,3), so moving up would go to (5,4).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 2 and life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 60, life span is 1, so after this turn, it might disappear? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food at (4,4) with life span 1 at turn 60. That means on turn 60, life span is 1, so after turn 60, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 60, I think? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". And \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: when spawned, life span is N. Each turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before next turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it will be gone.\n> \n> But with countdown decreasing every turn including current, let's interpret.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, L becomes L-1. If L-1 == 0, it disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, if L=1 at turn t, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn t if the head moves there on turn t.\n> \n> If L=2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and after turn t+1, it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,4): value 2, life span 1 at turn 60. So on turn 60, life span is 1. After turn 60, it will decrease to 0 and disappear. So it must be eaten on turn 60 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food: (5,5) value 5, life span 5 at turn 60. So it has 5 turns to be eaten, from turn 60 to 64 inclusive? Life span 5 at turn 60: after turn 60, it becomes 4; after turn 61, 3; ... after turn 64, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 60,61,62,63,64.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: list is [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6)?

(4,4) is both a food position and part of the snake body? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions end with (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). So the tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> But food is at (4,4) with value 2, life span 1.\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied by the snake's tail. According to the rule, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,4) is the tail segment. So if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, then head can move to (4,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake head is at (5,3), tail is at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (5,3) and (4,4): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,3) to (4,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3) for (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, tail at (4,4), adjacent cells are (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n> \n> Head at (5,3) is not adjacent to tail at (4,4); they are diagonal.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from Tail Reward Danger here.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,4) is under the tail.

Tail was (4,4), which is gone, so new tail is (4,5).\n> \n> (4,4) is no longer occupied by snake; it's free now, but there is food there.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) was under tail, now tail moved to (4,5), so (4,4) is free and has food.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need head to move to (4,4) on this turn or future turns, but life span is 1, so only this turn.\n> \n> On this turn, we moved to (5,4), so head is at (5,4), not at (4,4).

(5,3) to (4,4): x-1, y+1, which is diagonal, not a valid move.

Then the body moves, tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> But for food under body, we can only eat it if body moves away and head moves onto it, which requires that on the turn head moves to the cell, the cell is free and has food.\n> \n> In this case, at start of turn 60, (4,4) has food but is occupied by tail.\n> \n> After we move, if we don't move head to (4,4), tail moves away, (4,4) is free with food, but head is not there, so not eaten.

It's turn 63, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,5), and the body follows: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the tail is at (4,6). The head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (4,5) from (5,5) I think? Let's see the positions: from (5,5) to (4,5), yes, moving left.\n> \n> Now, food: there's only one food mentioned: at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Value 1 means it's positive food, since +1. Life span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns, including the current turn, so if not eaten soon, it might vanish.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Food at (2,6).\n> \n> But (2,6) is also part of the snake body? Let's see: snake positions include (2,6), which is the 14th segment? List indices: position 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (3,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,4), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,6), 14: (3,6), 15: (4,6). So (2,6) is the 13th segment? Index 13: (2,6), yes.\n> \n> But food is at (2,6), which is currently occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So, since the snake is currently on (2,6), the food there can't be eaten immediately because the head isn't on it, and the body is there. For the head to eat it, the body must move away first, then head moves to (2,6).\n> \n> The snake moves each turn: the head moves in a direction, and the tail moves forward, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> Current head at (4,5), moving left. Last move was to (4,5) from (5,5), so direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): since head direction is L, but I can choose to move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Reverse of L is R, so I cannot move right immediately, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U, D, L.

But according to collision rules, I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, because the tail will move forward, so it might be safe if I'm moving to where the tail was, but the tail moves away.\n> \n> General rule: head can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, because after movement, the tail is no longer there, and the head is there, with body shifted.\n> \n> But if I move to a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, (4,6) is the tail. If I move up to (4,6), and since it's the tail, after movement, the head is at (4,6), and the tail moves to the next position? No, the tail moves based on the direction; when head moves, the body follows, so the segment that was at (4,6) will move to where the previous segment was, but in this case, since it's the tail, it will be removed or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment (last one) leaves its position, so that cell is vacated.\n> \n> If the head moves to the current tail position, it should be safe because after movement, the tail is gone, and head is there with the body extended if food eaten, but in this case, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> In this move, if I move to (4,6), which is current tail, and since no food is eaten there (food is at (2,6), not here), so length doesn't increase, tail moves away, so head can safely occupy (4,6).\n> \n> But (4,6) is currently occupied, but by tail, so it's allowed.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other cells.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6) - currently occupied by tail (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,4) - what is there?

(4,4) is not in the list, so it should be empty, but there might be walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,4) is within bounds, x=4 between 1-6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is ok, y=4 is ok, not border. Internal obstacle at (6,4), not (4,4). So (4,4) should be empty.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,5) - is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc. (3,5) not in list, so empty.\n> \n> - Right (R): not allowed, reverse direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, U to (4,6): which is tail, so should be safe.\n> \n> D to (4,4): empty.\n> \n> L to (3,5): empty.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food at (2,6).

So when the snake moves, S[13] will move to S[12]'s position, and so on, so (2,6) will be occupied until S[13] is the tail, which requires the snake to move 2 times without growth, so that S[13] becomes the new tail after two moves.\n> \n> After one move: as above, new S[14] is at (2,6)\n> \n> After two moves, if no growth, the new tail will be at some position.\n> \n> But to vacate (2,6), it needs to be the tail position when the snake moves.\n> \n> Currently, after one move, new S[14] is at (2,6), which is not tail; tail is at new S[15] position.\n> \n> After two moves without growth, the segment that was at (2,6) will be closer to tail.\n> \n> Let k be the number of moves until the segment at (2,6) is the tail.\n> \n> Currently, S[13] at (2,6), S[14] at (3,6), S[15] at (4,6), so S[13] is two positions away from tail.\n> \n> After one move without growth, new snake: head new, then new S[1] at old head, ..., new S[14] at old S[13] = (2,6), new S[15] at old S[14] = (3,6), and old S[15] gone. So (2,6) is now occupied by new S[14], which is one from tail.\n> \n> After second move without growth, new head new position, new S[1] at previous head, ..., new S[14] at previous S[13] position, but previous S[13] was at (2,6)? Let's say after first move, positions: let's denote state after move.\n> \n> Assume first move, head to (3,5) for example.\n> \n> After move to (3,5):\n> \n> New positions: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  // new S[15] at (3,6), old (4,6) gone.\n> \n> So (2,6) is still occupied by new S[14]? New S[0] = (3,5), S[1] = (4,5), S[2] = (5,5), ..., S[13] = (2,5), S[14] = (2,6), S[15] = (3,6)\n> \n> So (2,6) occupied by S[14].\n> \n> After second move, say head to some position, new head, new S[1] at (3,5), new S[2] at (4,5), ..., new S[14] at (2,6)? New S[14] at position of previous S[13], which was (2,5), and new S[15] at position of previous S[14], which was (2,6), so (2,6) is now occupied by new S[15], the tail.\n> \n> Then after third move, if no growth, new head, new S[1] at previous head, ..., new S[15] at previous S[14] position, which was (2,5), and previous S[15] at (2,6) is vacated. So (2,6) is empty after the third move.\n> \n> From current state, after three moves without growth, the cell (2,6) will be vacated because the segment that was there becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, for the head to eat the food at (2,6), it needs to move to that cell after it is vacated.\n> \n> But the food has a life span; it disappears after 9 turns, including current turn 63, so on turn 63+9=72, it disappears. Turn 63 is current, so it can be eaten on turns 64 to 72, but since it disappears after N turns, meaning after turn 72 it's gone, so can be eaten up to turn 72.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 63, life span 9, so it has 9 turns left, including turn 63. After turn 63, life span 8, and so on, until after turn 71, life span 1, then after turn 72, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns 63 to 71? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So on turn 63, life span is 9, so countdown: after 9 turns, it disappears. So after turn 71 (since 63 to 71 is 9 turns? 63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71: that's 9 turns, so after turn 71, it disappears, meaning on turn 72 it's not there. So it can be eaten on turns 63 to 71 inclusive.\n> \n> But on turn 63, the food is at (2,6), which is occupied by snake body, so head can't eat it now. So earliest possible to eat is after it's vacated.\n> \n> As above, (2,6) will be vacated after three moves without growth.\n> \n> Current turn 63, after three moves: on turn 64,65,66, after three moves, on turn 66, after the move, (2,6) might be vacated.\n> \n> Let's define turns.\n> \n> Turn 63: current state.\n> \n> After action on turn 63, the snake moves, state for turn 64.\n> \n> After action on turn 64, state for turn 65, and so on.\n> \n> The food life span decreases at the end of each turn, I assume, after the move or before? The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so probably at the start or end of turn.\n> \n> I think it's common to decrease at the end of the turn, after actions.\n> \n> But to be precise, let's assume that at the beginning of turn, life span is as given, and after the move, if food eaten, it's consumed, else life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> For simplicity, since the food can only be eaten when head moves to it, and life span decreases after the turn.\n> \n> But for planning, on turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten, and food removed. Otherwise, at end of turn, life span decreases, and if 0, disappears.\n> \n> For this food, on turn 63, life span 9, so it can be eaten on turns 63 to 72? No.\n> \n> If on turn 63, if head could move to (2,6), but it can't because occupied, so not eaten.\n> \n> After turn 63, life span decreases to 8 for turn 64, and so on.\n> \n> After turn 71, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 72 or on turn 72.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns, including the current one, so from turn t to t+N-1 it exists, and at turn t+N it is gone.\n> \n> For example, on turn 63, it exists, after turn 63, countdown to 8, so on turn 64, life span 8, etc., until on turn 71, life span 1, after turn 71, it disappears, so on turn 72 it is not there.\n> \n> So food can be eaten on turns 63 to 71 inclusive.\n> \n> But on turn 63, it's occupied, so impossible to eat on turn 63.\n> \n> Earliest possible: after (2,6) is vacated.\n> \n> From current state, after three moves without growth, (2,6) is vacated on turn 66.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 63: current, head at (4,5), S[13] at (2,6)\n> \n> After turn 63 action: snake moves to new head position.\n> \n> Suppose we move in a way that doesn't eat food, so no growth.\n> \n> Then for turn 64 state: new head at say P, body shifted, S[13] now at (2,6) but moved to S[12] position? As before.\n> \n> After one move (turn 63 action), on turn 64 state, the segment that was at (2,6) is now at the position of old S[12] or something.\n> \n> After move, new S[14] is at (2,6) if no change, but in general, the cell (2,6) is still occupied by a body segment after one move, as in my earlier simulation.\n> \n> After two moves, it is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> After three moves, it is vacated.\n> \n> Turn 63: before move, S[13] at (2,6)\n> \n> After move (turn 63 action), new state for turn 64: new S[14] at old S[13] position = (2,6)  (since new S[14] is old S[13])\n> \n> In new state, (2,6) occupied by body segment.\n> \n> After turn 64 action (second move), new state for turn 65: new new S[15] at previous S[14] position, which was (2,6), so (2,6) occupied by new tail.\n> \n> After turn 65 action (third move), new state for turn 66: the tail moves away, so (2,6) is vacated, and food is there, so on turn 66, if head moves to (2,6), it can be eaten.\n> \n> On turn 66, during the action, head moves to (2,6), and if food is there, it is eaten.\n> \n> But on turn 65, in the state, (2,6) has the tail, and food is there, but head can move to tail cell, so on turn 65, if head moves to (2,6), it can eat the food there, even though it's the tail, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> According to rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And \"if the head moves onto the food cell\" it can be eaten.\n> \n> So on turn 65, when (2,6) is the tail position, head can move to it to eat the food, and since it's the tail, no collision, and snake grows.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 65, if (2,6) is the tail, and head moves to it, if head is adjacent before move, it might cause collision after growth.\n> \n> Let's see the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So when head moves to the tail cell to eat food, if before the move, the head was adjacent to the tail, then after eating, the new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head moved to tail, the new head is at tail position, and new tail is added at previous position, which might cause them to be adjacent or something.\n> \n> Suppose before move, head at H, tail at T, and H and T are adjacent.\n> \n> Then head moves to T to eat food. After move, new head at T, new body includes old head and old body, and since food eaten, a new tail segment is added at the old tail position T? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> From rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to food cell, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail end, so the tail position remains, and the new segment is added there, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to food at F, then new head at F, the body segments shift, but since growth, the tail position is kept, and a new segment is added there, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> More precisely: after head moves to new position (food cell), the body segments shift as usual, but instead of removing the tail, the tail is kept, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the snake elongates.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail is now a body segment, and the new tail is the new segment added.\n> \n> But in terms of position, the old tail position is still occupied.\n> \n> For the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, if head moves to tail cell to eat food, then after growth: new head at old tail position, and since growth, a new segment is added at old tail position, but old tail position is where head is now, so it's messy.\n> \n> Let's think coordinates.\n> \n> Suppose before move: head at H, tail at T, and H and T are adjacent.\n> \n> Food at T.\n> \n> Head moves to T.\n> \n> After move: new head at T.\n> \n> For the body: the old head H becomes new segment 1, so it moves to H position? No, the positions: new head at T.\n> \n> Then the first body segment is at old head position H.\n> \n> Then the rest of body shifts, but since food eaten, growth: a new segment is added at the old tail position T.\n> \n> But new head is at T, so adding a new segment at T would cause two segments at T, which is impossible.\n> \n> I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail, so the snake grows by one segment, with the tail staying in place.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> Before move: head H, body B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail T.\n> \n> Food at F.\n> \n> Head moves to F.\n> \n> If F is not T, then new head at F, new body: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, and new tail at T (since growth, tail doesn't move).\n> \n> If F is T, then head moves to T, which is tail, so new head at T, and new body: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, and since growth, a new segment is added at the old tail position T, but T is where new head is, so it would be head and new segment at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, if the food is at the tail cell, and head moves to it, since the tail stays and new segment added, it causes the head and the new segment to be at the same cell, which is death.\n> \n> The rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, to avoid this, you should not eat food that is at the tail cell if the head is adjacent to the tail; because after eating, the new head and the new tail segment are at the same position.\n> \n> If the head is not adjacent, it might be ok, but if not adjacent, head can't move to tail in one step unless adjacent.\n> \n> Since head can only move to adjacent cells, it can only move to tail if adjacent.\n> \n> So, in summary, never eat food that is at the tail cell, because it will cause collision upon growth.\n> \n> For the food at (2,6), it is currently not the tail; tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> But when we want to eat it, if at that time it is the tail cell, we should not move to it if head is adjacent.\n> \n> In our case, for (2,6) to be eatable, it needs to be vacated or be the tail.\n> \n> On turn 65, it might be the tail, as we said.\n> \n> But if head moves to it then, and it is tail, collision.\n> \n> Otherwise, on turn 66, it is vacated, then head can move to it safely.\n> \n> Let's go back to planning.\n> \n> For now, at turn 63, I need to choose an action.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> U: to (4,6) - currently tail, so moving to tail cell.

It's turn 64, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow. So the head is at (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), and tail at (3,6). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> The head direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downward. From (4,4) to... since it's moving down, the y-coordinate decreases, so from (4,4) to (4,3) or something? But the current head is at (4,4), and direction is D, so it just moved to (4,4) from (4,5) I think. Let's see the positions: head (4,4), next is (4,5). If head is at (4,4) and direction is D, that means it was previously at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4). Yes, that makes sense because (4,5) is the second position.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will disappear after 8 turns, including this turn, so it has 7 more turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 64, life span is 8, meaning it will disappear after turn 64 + 8 - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The life span is given as the number of turns it will last, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For food at (2,6) with life_span=8 at turn 64. So after turn 64, countdown becomes 7; after turn 65, 6; ... after turn 71, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 64 to turn 71 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) with life_span=10, so it can be eaten from turn 64 to turn 73 inclusive.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

But no instant reverse, so since direction is D (down), I cannot move up (U) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (4,4), so previous move was down. Therefore, I cannot move up immediately, as that would be reverse. So possible moves from (4,4) are: D (down to (4,3)), L (left to (3,4)), or R (right to (5,4)).\n> \n> Now, check what cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> First, (4,3): is it free?

Internal obstacle is at (6,4), not (4,3). So (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): not in snake positions, not a wall, x=3,y=4 is fine.\n> \n> (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied by the snake! (5,4) is the fourth segment: positions index 3 is (5,4)? Let's see: index 0: (4,4) head, index 1: (4,5), index 2: (5,5), index 3: (5,4), yes, (5,4) is occupied by body.\n> \n> So moving right to (5,4) would cause collision with body, since head would touch body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,3): is (4,3) occupied? Not in the list, so free.\n> \n> Moving left to (3,4): not in list, should be free.\n> \n> (3,4) is not in the positions: positions are (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So (3,4) is not there, and not a wall, so free.\n> \n> Also, (5,4) is occupied, so moving right is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from current position (4,4) with direction D: I can move D to (4,3), or L to (3,4), or R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so collision, not possible. So only D or L.\n> \n> R to (5,4) is occupied, so not possible. U is reverse, not allowed. So only down or left.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (2,6) and (4,1).\n> \n> (2,6) is actually occupied by the snake! Look: (2,6) is the 15th segment? Positions: index 14 is (2,6), and index 15 is (3,6) tail.\n> \n> (2,6) has food on it? Food at (2,6) with value 1.\n> \n> But the snake body is on (2,6), so according to rules, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1), which is also occupied by snake: positions index 7 is (4,1).\n> \n> Both foods are under the snake body.\n> \n> (4,1) is the 8th segment? Index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), yes.\n> \n> So food at (4,1) and (2,6) are both under body segments.\n> \n> To eat them, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (2,6) has life span 8 at turn 64, so it will disappear after turn 71, as I thought earlier.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) has life span 10, disappear after turn 73.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the current possible moves: down to (4,3) or left to (3,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (4,3), what happens? The snake moves, so head goes to (4,3), and tail moves away from (3,6). The new positions: head at (4,3), then body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), and tail was (3,6) but since we moved, tail moves forward, so the segment that was at (2,6) becomes the new tail? Let's think how snake movement works.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, but each segment shifts forward. So the cell that was tail is no longer occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, from current positions, if head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, so the new snake has the head at new position, and all other segments shift, so the last segment (tail) is dropped.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (4,3), new head at (4,3), then the body: previous head (4,4) becomes first body segment, then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), and the tail (3,6) is dropped, so it's no longer part of snake.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6) since the tail was (3,6), which is dropped, so the segment that was at (2,6) is now the last body segment, but since tail dropped, (2,6) is part of body, not tail yet? Let's index.\n> \n> After move: new head: (4,3)\n> \n> Then body segments: the previous segments from index 0 to 14, but shifted: index 0 was head, now becomes body, so position (4,4) is now first body segment.\n> \n> Then index 1: (4,5) second body\n> \n> Index 2: (5,5) third\n> \n> Index 3: (5,4) fourth\n> \n> Index 4: (5,3) fifth\n> \n> Index 5: (5,2) sixth\n> \n> Index 6: (5,1) seventh\n> \n> Index 7: (4,1) eighth\n> \n> Index 8: (3,1) ninth\n> \n> Index 9: (3,2) tenth\n> \n> Index 10: (2,2) eleventh\n> \n> Index 11: (2,3) twelfth\n> \n> Index 12: (2,4) thirteenth\n> \n> Index 13: (2,5) fourteenth\n> \n> Index 14: (2,6) fifteenth? But there were 16 segments, after move, head moved to new cell, tail is removed, so new snake has 16 segments? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: 16 cells, including head and tail.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length remains same.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new position, then the first 15 segments of previous become the body, but since tail is removed, the new body has one less segment?

Similarly, food is under the body.\n> \n> So both food items are under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,6), the tail must move away, and then head must move to (2,6). But tail is at (2,6), and when the snake moves, the tail will move only if the head doesn't eat food; if head eats food, tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, since food is under tail, if head eats it when tail moves away, but tail moving away means the cell is free.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4), direction L, so last move was left to (3,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,3)\n> \n> - Left: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,4)\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied by body, so moving right would cause collision.

Snake positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), etc. No (3,5), so (3,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (3,3) — not in positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Left: (2,4) — is in positions, (2,4) is body segment, so occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> Right: (4,4) — is body segment, occupied, cannot move.\n> \n> So from current position, possible moves: Up to (3,5) or Down to (3,3).

When the snake moves, if no food is eaten, tail moves forward, so the cell (2,6) will be free after this turn if snake doesn't eat.\n> \n> If snake eats food, tail doesn't move, so (2,6) remains occupied.\n> \n> But to eat food at (2,6), head needs to be there when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,1).\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,4), and we can move U or D.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), what happens?\n> \n> New head position (3,5), then the body: the segment that was at (3,4) becomes body, and so on, tail at (2,6) moves to (2,5)?

Eating the food at (2,6) on turn 67 is prioritized due to its shorter life span (7 turns), and subsequent moves (D and L) navigate away from the top-left corner to reduce collision risks while positioning for future access to the food at (4,1). Long-term survival is favored by steering toward open areas and avoiding body/wall collisions.\n",

That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so walls are at all those coordinates. For example, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), inclusive. That's a 6x6 area.\n> \n> There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow. The list is: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]. That's 16 segments. So the snake is 16 cells long.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns, thinking ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5)\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and (4,1)\n> \n> (2,6): y=6 is the top border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable? Let's see: walls are y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, which is playable since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall unless specified. Border cells are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, (2,6) is playable because x=2 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7? y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be playable. y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the highest playable row.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): x=4, y=1, which is playable.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (2,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn. So if not eaten by turn 66+6=72, it vanishes.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 8, disappears after turn 66+8=74.\n> \n> Current turn is 66, so for (2,6), it will be gone after turn 72, meaning it can be eaten on turns 66 to 72 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1, I think. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it's gone. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, countdown starts at L, decreases each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if eaten when countdown >0, it's valid.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is L, so it can be eaten on any turn where countdown >=1, up to turn t + L - 1, and disappears on turn t + L.\n> \n> For (2,6) at turn 66: life span 6, so countdown 6 at turn 66. It can be eaten on turns 66,67,68,69,70,71. Disappears after turn 71, so on turn 72 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life span 8, countdown 8 at turn 66, can be eaten turns 66 to 73, disappears turn 74.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,5), moving up (U), so from (3,5), moving up would go to (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is playable? x=3, y=6, not border, so yes.\n> \n> But is (3,6) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> (4,1) is a food position, but also occupied by snake body? Snake has (4,1) as a body segment. Food is at (4,1), but snake is on it? That can happen, as per rules: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is food, not occupied by snake currently.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), moving U to (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is not in snake positions, and not wall, so it's free? But let's check if it's food or something. (2,6) is food, not (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5) with current direction U.\n> \n> Since head direction is U, possible moves: U, L, R. Cannot move D because that would be instant reverse? Current direction is U, so moving D would be down, opposite to up, so instant reverse not allowed. So can only move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> From (3,5), moving U: (3,6)\n> \n> Moving L: (2,5)\n> \n> Moving R: (4,5)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (3,6): not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (2,5) is tail, (3,5) head, (4,5) body, etc. (3,6) not in list, so empty. And not wall. So safe to move to? But need to consider future.\n> \n> (2,5): is occupied by snake body? (2,5) is in positions, it's the tail. But moving to tail is allowed because when head moves to tail, tail will move away, so no collision. Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): is occupied? Snake has (4,5) as a body segment. Positions: (4,5) is there, between head and others. Specifically, indices: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), ... so (4,5) is the fourth segment? Let's order: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), etc. So (4,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (2,5).\n> \n> Moving to (2,5) is moving to tail, which is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> Moving to (4,5) is moving to a body segment, which would cause collision because it's not the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (4,5), it's a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is empty, so safe.\n> \n> (2,5) is tail, so safe to move to.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,6): empty, safe\n> \n> - L to (2,5): tail, safe\n> \n> - R to (4,5): body segment, collision, deadly, not possible.\n> \n> Cannot move D because instant reverse.\n> \n> So only U or L are possible immediate moves.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,6) is at (2,6), which is above (2,5)? (2,6) is north of (2,5).\n> \n> (4,1) is at (4,1), which is occupied by snake body, so cannot eat immediately.\n> \n> Goal is to maximize score, so eat positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider eating (2,6). It's at (2,6), life span 6, so we have until turn 71 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) at (4,1), life span 8, until turn 73.\n> \n> But (4,1) is under snake body now, so we need to move the body away and then head to it.\n> \n> Currently, head at (3,5), (2,6) is at (2,6), which is adjacent: left and up? (3,5) to (2,6) is not adjacent; (2,6) is left and up, but not directly adjacent in one move? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) and (2,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> From (3,5), to reach (2,6), I need to move left to (2,5) or up to (3,6), then to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), which is one up from (2,5) or one left from (3,6).\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 66.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (3,6) on turn 66.\n> \n> Then head at (3,6).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since I moved U, direction is now U.\n> \n> Can move U, L, R.\n> \n> But U to (3,7): y=7 is wall, so cannot move up, out of bounds.\n> \n> L to (2,6)\n> \n> R to (4,6)\n> \n> (2,6) is food, so I could eat it on turn 67 if I go there.\n> \n> (4,6) is empty? Need to check.\n> \n> Snake positions after moving to (3,6): when head moves to (3,6), the tail moves forward? Snake movement: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head at (3,5), then body.\n> \n> After moving U to (3,6), new head at (3,6), then body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,5), then next to where first body was, and so on, tail is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n> \n> Tail was (2,5), which is removed, so (2,4) becomes the new tail?

Since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new head at (2,6), and the body: the segment that was at old head (3,6) moves to (3,6)?

It's turn 67, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). That's 16 segments, so the snake is 16 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is U (up), which means it's moving upwards. So from (3,6), moving U would go to (3,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's not possible. y=7 is the top border, so moving up from (3,6) to (3,7) would hit the wall. That means the snake can't move up right now because it would die.\n> \n> But the head direction is given as U, so on this turn, it must have been moving up, but since it's at (3,6), and y=7 is wall, moving up isn't possible. But the state says head direction is U, so I think that means the direction it was moving to get to the current position. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Head Direction: U\" – this is the current direction, meaning for the next move, if no change, it would continue in that direction. But since it's at (3,6), moving U to (3,7) is invalid because it's a wall. So I need to choose a different direction.\n> \n> The rules say: \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R\". And \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down immediately.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,6): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> - U: (3,7) – y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) – but (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body. Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), etc. So (3,5) is the second segment. Moving to (3,5) would cause a body collision, which is deadly. So invalid.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) – let's check if this is valid. x=2, y=6. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=2 is fine, y=6 is not 0 or 7. Also, no internal wall at (2,6). Now, is (2,6) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty. Also, no food mentioned at (2,6), but food is separate. So moving left to (2,6) seems possible.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) – x=4, y=6. Not a wall, and not in snake positions? Snake has (4,4), (4,5), (4,1), but not (4,6). Positions: (4,4), (4,5), and (4,1) are present, but (4,6) is not listed, so it should be empty. So moving right to (4,6) is also possible.\n> \n> So from (3,6), with head direction U, I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6). D is invalid (collision), U is invalid (wall).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 5. But I just considered moving to (2,6). Food at (2,6)? Food positions: (2,6,5,1) – that's (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format is \"(x,y, value, life_span)\"? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 5, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\" but lists (x,y, life_span, value)? No: \" (2, 6, 5, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the description, it's \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \", but here it's written as (2,6,5,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? I think there's inconsistency.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 5, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\" but the tuple is (x,y, ?, ?). From the core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be coordinate, then value, then life_span.\n> \n> But here it's written as (2,6,5,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? Let's see the example: \" (2, 6, 5, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y, life_span, value). But in core rules, it's value then life_span. I think it's a mistake in the input.\n> \n> Core rules say: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> But in state input, it says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 5, 1)\" – it swapped the order? That's confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the numbers: for (2,6,5,1), 5 and 1, life_span and value. Value is 1, life_span is 5? Or value 5, life_span 1? But value should be +1 or -1 for food, I think.\n> \n> Positive food value +1, negative -1. Here it's 1, so probably value=1. Life span 5 turns.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (4,1,7,1) and (5,1,10,1). So (4,1,7,1) – x=4,y=1, value=1? life_span=7? Or value=7? But value should be ±1, so likely value is the last number? (2,6,5,1) – if value is 1, life_span 5, or value 5 life_span 1? But value should be +1 or -1, so it must be that the third number is life_span and fourth is value, or vice versa?\n> \n> I think there's inconsistency. In core rules, it's ( (x,y), value, life_span ), so for example, ( (2,6), 1, 5 ) for value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> But in the input, it's written as (2,6,5,1), which might be a tuple with four elements, but it should be coordinate and then value and life span.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) to match the \"Life Span and Value\" label.\n> \n> To resolve, let's assume that since it says \"Life Span and Value\", and lists (x,y, a, b), a is life_span, b is value. Because value should be small, ±1, and life span can be larger, like 5,7,10.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1,7,1) life_span 7, value 1; (5,1,10,1) life_span 10, value 1.\n> \n> All values are +1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Also, for (4,1) and (5,1), but these are occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (4,1) and (5,1). Specifically, (5,1) is in the list, and (4,1) is also in the list.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1) are both part of the body.\n> \n> Food at (4,1,7,1) and (5,1,10,1), but these cells are currently occupied by the snake. So according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So for now, I can't eat them immediately because the snake is on them.\n> \n> Back to the head position.\n> \n> So at (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, (2,6) has food with value +1, life span 5. If I move to (2,6), I can eat it, since it's not under snake body currently? (2,6) is not occupied by snake, as per positions list. Snake positions don't have (2,6), so it should be free, and food is there.\n> \n> So moving to (2,6) would eat the food, increase length by 1, score +1.\n> \n> If I move to (4,6), no food there, so no eating.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (2,6) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including this one? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t=67, so food at (2,6) life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 67+4 = 71? Let's see: if life span N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning it will be gone on turn t + N.\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is N, then at turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., at turn t + N -1, countdown 1, then at turn t + N, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn t + N -1.\n> \n> For food at (2,6), life span 5 at turn 67, so:\n> \n> Turn 67: countdown 5\n> \n> Turn 68: countdown 4\n> \n> Turn 69: countdown 3\n> \n> Turn 70: countdown 2\n> \n> Turn 71: countdown 1\n> \n> Turn 72: gone, so can be eaten until turn 71.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 16 segments, so it takes up space.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the one ahead. When it eats, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move; the segment before tail becomes new tail position? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed from the end.\n> \n> When it eats, head moves to new cell with food, new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays in place, but the segment that was tail becomes part of body, and new tail is the one before.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; the new position list has head new, then the old head, then body, and tail remains.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [H(3,6), B1(3,5), B2(3,4), ..., T(2,4)]\n> \n> If I move to (2,6) and eat, new positions: [H_new(2,6), H_old(3,6), B1(3,5), B2(3,4), ..., T(2,4)] and since ate, a new segment is added, so the tail T(2,4) stays, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So positions: new head at (2,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes neck, then B1(3,5), B2(3,4), ..., up to the tail (2,4), and since ate, the tail segment stays, so the segment that was second last becomes last, but with growth, the tail position remains, and we add a new segment at the tail.\n> \n> Perhaps better to think: the snake moves forward; if no eat, tail is removed; if eat, tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions sequence: after move and eat, head is at new position, and all previous positions are kept, with the tail extended.\n> \n> From list: before move, positions: index 0: (3,6) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (3,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (2,3), 15: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> If move to (2,6) and eat, new head at (2,6), so new positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ] and since ate, we add a new segment at the tail, so the tail (2,4) becomes the second last, and new tail at (2,4)?

It's turn 68. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,6), then body segments: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, meaning left. So the snake is moving left, and since it just moved to (2,6) from (3,6), I assume.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 68 + 6 = 74? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 68, life span is 6, then turn 69 it becomes 5, ..., down to 0 on turn 73, and disappears after that, so not available on turn 74. But since we eat on the turn we move to it, as long as we move to it before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Value 1 is positive, so both are positive food.

Let me check the input.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 1, 6, 1) - (5, 1, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> It says (x, y, life_span, value). So for (4,1): x=4,y=1, life_span=6, value=1. Similarly (5,1): x=5,y=1, life_span=9, value=1. Both value 1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> But there's a note about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because the head and newly grown tail collide.

So at turn t with life_span L, it will be present for L more turns, including this one? No.\n> \n> Say at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears before turn t+1 if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t, so not available on turn t+1.\n> \n> Standard: at the start of turn t, life_span L means it can be eaten during turn t, and after that, life_span decreases to L-1 for the next turn, and if L-1>0, it remains, else it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,1) at turn 68, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 68,69,70,71,72,73, and disappears after turn 73, not present on turn 74.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life_span=9, so present until turn 76 (68+8=76? Turn 68: L=9, can be eaten turn 68; turn 69: L=8, ..., turn 76: L=1, can be eaten, disappears after.\n> \n> Turn 68: L=9, eaten turn 68 → L decreases to 8 for turn 69.\n> \n> Turn 69: L=8, eaten turn 69 → L=7 for turn 70, and so on, until turn 76: L=1, eaten turn 76 → L=0, disappears, not on turn 77.\n> \n> So (4,1) available from turn 68 to 73 inclusive.\n> \n> (5,1) available from turn 68 to 76 inclusive.\n> \n> But both are currently under snake body, so not accessible now.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's find where the tail is and how it moves.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,4).

Positions: index 16 is (2,4), index 15 is (2,3), index 14 is (2,2), etc.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if we move to (2,5) or (1,6), no food, then tail (2,4) is removed, and new tail is (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if we move to a food cell, we eat, length increases, so tail stays, but we add a new head, so the segment that was tail remains.\n> \n> But here, food is not at head, so we won't eat this turn.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6) with direction L:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - not wall, not occupied?

It's turn 70. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are inaccessible. Also, (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), and the body segments follow: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). That's 17 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - Then: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> The last one is (2,2), which should be the tail.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is down. But down means decreasing y, I think? Let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the wall: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. U: (x,y+1) moves up (increasing y), D: (x,y-1) moves down (decreasing y), L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it's moving down, meaning decreasing y.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), direction D, so it just moved to (2,4) from above? Positions: head is (2,4), previous position would be the next segment. Snake positions list: head first, so (2,4) is head, then (2,5) is the first body segment. Since it's moving down, from (2,5) to (2,4)? (2,5) has higher y, so if head was at (2,5) and moved down to (2,4), then (2,5) should be just behind head. But the list is [(2,4), (2,5), ...], so head at (2,4), then (2,5), which means the snake was moving upwards? Confusion.\n> \n> Let's think carefully. The positions are listed from head to tail. So current head is (2,4). The next segment is (2,5), which is directly above (y=5 > y=4). Then (2,6) above that. Then (3,6), which is right and same y? (3,6) is x=3,y=6. Then (3,5), which is down to y=5, and so on.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning down. But if head is at (2,4) and the next segment is (2,5), that means the snake was moving downward to reach (2,4), so from (2,5) to (2,4), decreasing y. Yes, that makes sense. So the head is moving down, with the body behind it at (2,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, no negative food mentioned. Life span: for (4,1), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn t=70. So at turn 70, life span 4, after turn 70, it will be 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 and disappear. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So accessible area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> Tail is (2,2).\n> \n> Now food at: (4,1), (5,1), (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,1) and (5,1) are occupied by snake body? (5,1) is a body segment, (4,1) is also a body segment. Let's see: snake positions include (5,1) and (4,1), so food at (4,1) and (5,1) are under the snake's body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) might be free or occupied? Snake positions: (5,2) is body, (4,2) is not listed, so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> List all snake cells:\n> \n> (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> Food at (4,1) and (5,1) are occupied by body segments. (4,1) is occupied by snake, (5,1) occupied by snake. (4,2) is not in snake positions, so it should be accessible.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,4), direction D (down). Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Current direction D, so cannot move U next. Possible moves: D (down, to (2,3)?), L (left, to (1,4)), R (right, to (3,4)).\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> - D to (2,3): y=3, x=2. Is it within bounds? x=2, y=3, should be accessible since walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3) is fine, no wall. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - L to (1,4): x=1,y=4, not wall, not in snake positions, free.\n> \n> - R to (3,4): x=3,y=4. But (3,4) is a body segment! Look: snake has (3,4) listed, so it's occupied. Cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,4) is the sixth segment? Positions: index 0: (2,4) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), so (3,4) is a body segment, yes. So moving R to (3,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (2,4), possible moves: D to (2,3) or L to (1,4). R is blocked by body, U is not allowed because no reverse from D.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U, which is opposite.\n> \n> So only L or D possible immediately.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the food situation.\n> \n> Food at (4,1): under body, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 73? Turn t=70, life span 4, so after 4 turns: at start of turn 70, life span 4; after turn 70, it decreases to 3; after turn 71, to 2; after turn 72, to 1; after turn 73, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 73, but only if head can move there after body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): life span 7, disappears after turn 76.\n> \n> (4,2): life span 10, disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> Now, (4,1) and (5,1) are currently under snake body. Specifically, (4,1) is occupied by a body segment, which is the 13th segment? Positions: let's index from head.\n> \n> Head: (2,4) index 0\n> \n> 1: (2,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,6)\n> \n> 3: (3,6)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,4)\n> \n> 6: (4,4)\n> \n> 7: (4,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,5)\n> \n> 9: (5,4)\n> \n> 10: (5,3)\n> \n> 11: (5,2)\n> \n> 12: (5,1)  // food here\n> \n> 13: (4,1)  // food here\n> \n> 14: (3,1)\n> \n> 15: (3,2)\n> \n> 16: (2,2) tail\n> \n> (4,1) is index 13, (5,1) is index 12.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if the snake moves without eating, the tail segment (2,2) will be vacated, and the head moves to a new position, so the segment at (4,1) and (5,1) will shift towards the tail over time.\n> \n> Since there is food under them, to eat it, the head needs to move to that cell after it is vacated and before the food disappears.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,2), which is currently free, I think. (4,2) is not in snake positions, and not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: walls are only borders and (6,4), so (4,2) should be accessible.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,4), I can move L to (1,4) or D to (2,3).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, so probably I want to eat the available food, but avoid dangers.\n> \n> First, let's see the map to understand the snake's shape.\n> \n> The snake is long: 17 segments.

By moving down to (2,2) on turn 71 and then right to (3,2) on turn 72, the snake positions itself to access open space. Moving up to (3,3) on turn 73 and right to (4,3) on turn 74 creates a safe approach path, allowing a downward move to (4,2) on turn 75 to eat the food with minimal collision risk, and the subsequent grid configuration provides an escape route for long-term survival.\n",

It's turn 72. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), and the body segments follow: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). That's 17 segments. Head direction is Down, so moving down.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Let me check the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 72, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 73, so it can be eaten on turn 72 or 73.\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1, and it says \"value1\" etc., and from the description, positive food has +1, negative has -1. Here all have value 1, so all positive. But for (4,1), it says \"value1\" but in the food positions it's listed as (4,1,2,1) – I think that means (x,y, life_span, value). Let me read: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" No, in the input it says: \"(4, 1, 2, 1)\" which might be (x,y, life_span, value). But in the description, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so probably (x,y), value, life_span.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state it's given as \"(4, 1, 2, 1)\" which I think is a tuple: (x, y, life_span, value). But value is 1, life_span is given. Similarly, (5,1,5,1) so x=5,y=1, life_span=5, value=1; (4,2,8,1) so x=4,y=2, life_span=8, value=1. All value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,2) and direction is Down. So it's moving down, so from (2,2), down would be to (2,1), but let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up next. But current direction is down, so from (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1), but y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is valid? y=1, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), but (2,1) is fine.\n> \n> Now, where is (2,1)? Is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So (2,1) is not in the list, so it's empty.\n> \n> But (4,1) and (5,1) have food, but (2,1) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> Food at (4,1), (5,1), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) has food.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,2), direction down.\n> \n> Possible actions: Down to (2,1), Left to (1,2), Right to (3,2). Cannot go up to (2,3) because that would be reverse, and (2,3) is also occupied by body.\n> \n> (2,3) is the second segment, so if I go up, head to (2,3), which is body, collision.\n> \n> But movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since current direction is down, I cannot move up.\n> \n> Also, deadly collisions: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving into tail, it might be ok if tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,1). If I move to a cell that will be vacated by tail, it might be ok.\n> \n> But for (2,3), it's not tail, it's body, so collision if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls. So (1,2) is x=1,y=2, which is not border, so ok. (3,2) is also ok. (2,1) is y=1, not y=0, so ok.\n> \n> Now, food: I need to consider eating food, but with risks.\n> \n> First, let's plot the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: let's trace the body.\n> \n> Head at (2,2). Then down? No, positions: (2,2) head, then (2,3) which is up, since y=3 > y=2, so snake was moving up to (2,3), but current direction is down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> From head (2,2) to next (2,3): that's increasing y, so upward movement. But head direction is given as \"D\" for down. That can't be right.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. Head at (2,2), then (2,3) is at same x, higher y, so if y increases upward, then (2,2) to (2,3) is up.\n> \n> But direction is given as down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Maybe the coordinates: y=0 is bottom or top? In grid, usually y=0 is bottom or top? In the context, it doesn't specify, but in movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n> \n> So from (2,2) to (2,3) is up, so the snake was moving up to get to (2,3), but the head is at (2,2), and the next segment is (2,3), so the head just moved to (2,2), and the previous position was? The positions are listed head first, so (2,2) is current head, (2,3) is the segment behind it, so the snake was moving from (2,3) to (2,2)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions: the list is from head to tail. So head is at index 0, (2,2). Then the body segments follow: index 1 is (2,3), which is the first body segment after head, so the head is at (2,2), and the neck is at (2,3), meaning the snake moved down from (2,3) to (2,2)? Let's think.\n> \n> If the snake is moving, the head is at the front. So when the head moves to a new cell, the body follows.\n> \n> The positions are the current positions. So at this turn, head is at (2,2), and the segment that was head before is now at (2,3), so the snake moved from (2,3) to (2,2) in the last turn, which is down, since y decreased from 3 to 2.\n> \n> Yes! So from (2,3) to (2,2) is down, so direction down is correct.\n> \n> Then next segment is (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), then (3,6) — from (2,6) to (3,6) is right, since x increased.\n> \n> Then (3,6) to (3,5) is down?

It's turn 74. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,1), and the body segments follow: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then: (3,2)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (2,5)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,1)\n> \n> The snake has 17 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1), but since it's moving down, y decreases? No, in standard coordinates, down might increase y or decrease, but in the movement constraints, D is defined as (x,y-1), so y decreases when moving down? Let me check the movement constraints.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, y=0 is the bottom or top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here since U is (x,y+1), that means y increases upwards, I think. U is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y. D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is one boundary, y=7 the other.\n> \n> For example, if head is at (3,1) and moves D, to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't move there if it's a wall. But (3,1) with direction D, so it might be able to move down to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so it can't.\n> \n> Current head position is (3,1), direction D, so it just moved down to (3,1), I assume.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (5,1,4,1) that should be (x,y, life_span, value). Format: Food Positions: ( (x1,y1), value, life_span )\n> \n> It says: (5, 1, 4, 1) — I think it's (x,y, life_span, value) but it says \"value and life span\", and in the list it's written as (5,1,4,1) which might be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? Let me read.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (5, 1, 4, 1) - (4, 2, 6, 1) - (1, 3, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> And it says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for (5,1,4,1), it should be (x=5, y=1, value=4, life_span=1)? But value is usually +1 or -1 for food, but here it says value=4? That can't be right.\n> \n> Look back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (5, 1, 4, 1) - (4, 2, 6, 1) - (1, 3, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, food has value and life span, value is +1 or -1, but here for (5,1,4,1), if it's (x,y, value, life_span), then value=4, which is not +1 or -1. That must be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) with value last? But the text says \"Value and Life Span\", so it should be value first or last?\n> \n> I think there might be a confusion. In the state input format, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for each food, it's a tuple of (position, value, life_span).\n> \n> But in the current state, it's listed as (5,1,4,1) which has four numbers, so it should be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n> \n> The text says: \"(5, 1, 4, 1)\" and similarly for others. But in the description, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so (x1,y1) is a pair, then value, then life_span.\n> \n> But (5,1,4,1) has four elements, so it's likely (x, y, value, life_span) for (5,1) with value=4? But value should be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food.\n> \n> That doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) with value last.\n> \n> Let's see the values: all have last number as 1, and core rules say positive food +1, negative -1, so probably value is the last number.\n> \n> For (5,1,4,1) it might be x=5,y=1, life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2,6,1) : x=4,y=2, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (1,3,9,1) : x=1,y=3, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> All value=1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 74, so for food at (5,1), life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 74 + 3 = 77? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, life_span L, it will be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 74, life_span=4, so it has 4 turns left: at turn 74, L=4; turn 75, L=3; turn 76, L=2; turn 77, L=1; at turn 78 it disappears? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> After N turns from now, it disappears. So if at turn t, life_span N, it will exist for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (5,1): at turn 74, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 77 (since turn 74,75,76,77 are 4 turns, gone at 78).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): life_span=6, disappear after turn 79.\n> \n> (1,3): life_span=9, disappear after turn 82.\n> \n> All value=1, so all good to eat, but we have to be careful with risks.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (3,1), direction D, which is down, so moving to (x,y-1).\n> \n> But y=1, moving down to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so it can't move down, because (3,0) is a wall cell.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (3,0) is out of bounds, wall.\n> \n> Also, head direction is D, so from previous move, it came to (3,1) by moving down, I assume.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, it can move L, R, or D, but D to (3,0) is wall, so not possible. U is opposite to D? D is down, U is up, which is opposite, but movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: from D, can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> But D to (3,0) is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,1): L to (2,1), R to (4,1), or U to (3,2)? But U is opposite to current D, so cannot move U, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to reach (3,1). So for next move, it cannot move opposite, which is U.\n> \n> So possible: L, R, or D. But D is blocked by wall, so only L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, what about (2,1) and (4,1)?

It's turn 75. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and can't be moved to. Also, (6,4) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,1), and the body segments follow: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2).

No instant reverse, so since head direction is R (right), I cannot move left on the next turn (turn 75).\n> \n> Current head position: (4,1), direction R. So from (4,1), moving right would go to (5,1), which is where food is at (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) has food with life span 3. Since we're on turn 75, and life span decreases each turn including current, so after this turn, it will have 2 left, then 1, then gone.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,1), I eat the food there, since it's under the head position after move.\n> \n> But I need to consider the tail and body collision.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I eat the food at (5,1).\n> \n> When I eat food, the snake grows by one segment. So if I move to (5,1), head goes to (5,1), and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position would be: head at (5,1), then the previous head (4,1) becomes body, and so on, up to the tail.

Then new head position (5,1), and since food is eaten, tail stays, so the snake grows: new positions: head (5,1), then segment 0 becomes (4,1), segment 1 (3,1), ..., up to segment 16 (5,2), and new tail at (5,2), but since we grow, the tail doesn't move, so the segments are: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), ..., (5,2), so (5,2) is still there, and we add a new segment at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move the head to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance, so the snake increases in length by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the first body segment, and so on, down to the previous tail which remains.\n> \n> So after eating at (5,1):\n> \n> - New head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Then: previous head (4,1) now body\n> \n> - Then: (3,1), (3,2), ..., all the way to (5,2) which is still tail.\n> \n> But (5,2) was the tail, and now it's part of the body, and since we grow, we add a new segment at the end? No, in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays, and you add a new segment there? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard mechanic: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When snake moves to a cell with food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position, but tail does not leave, so the snake length increases by one; the tail cell is now occupied by the new last segment, and the cell is not freed.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the snake has one more segment. The head is at the new position, and the tail is at what was previously the tail position.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake: H at A, B, C tail at C.\n> \n> Move to D without food: H at D, B at A, C at B, tail at B? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: time t: head at P0, body P1, P2, ..., Pk tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell Q.\n> \n> If Q not food: new positions: head at Q, then P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}. Tail was Pk, which is now empty.\n> \n> If Q has food: new positions: head at Q, then P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk. So the tail is now at Pk, and length increased.\n> \n> In this case, positions: H (4,1), then B1 (3,1), B2 (3,2), ..., B16 (5,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1) which has food:\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,1), then B1 at (4,1), B2 at (3,1), B3 at (3,2), B4 at (2,2), ..., B16 at (5,2), and since food eaten, tail stays at (5,2), so now we have 17 segments, tail at (5,2).\n> \n> But (5,2) was already part of the snake, so it's fine.\n> \n> Now, is there a collision? Head at (5,1), body segments include (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> (5,2) is adjacent to head? (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically? No, (5,1) and (5,2) are different y, same x, so if y increases up, (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent if |dy|=1.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or? Not specified, but in grid, usually y=0 bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa? Movement U is (x,y+1), so if U is up, then y increases up, so (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n> \n> In positions, (4,1) to (3,1) to (3,2), etc., so from (4,1) to (3,1) is left, then to (3,2) is down?

So moving to (5,1) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> After move, head at (5,1), and the body includes (5,2), which is adjacent: (5,1) and (5,2) differ by y=1, so they are adjacent. But is this a problem? Only if the head is adjacent to the tail and there is food on the tail cell, but here the tail is at (5,2), and (5,2) has no food, it's part of the body.\n> \n> The \"Tail Reward Danger\" is when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail grows and occupies the same cell as head or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, before move, head at (4,1), tail at (5,2). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (5,2): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so same x or same y with |dx|=1 or |dy|=1, not diagonal.\n> \n> (4,1) and (5,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), head at (5,1), tail at (5,2), which are adjacent vertically. But (5,2) does not have food; it's the tail position, but no food on it.

So at turn 76, for (4,2), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t+N-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then disappears.

Turn 76: L=7, turn 77: L=6, ..., turn 82: L=1, turn 83: L=0 gone. So available turns 76 to 82.\n> \n> Turn 76: L=7, after decrease? The countdown decreases every turn including current, but for eating, it's available as long as life span >0.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn t, life span is L, after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But for movement and eating, during the turn, when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn t, food with life span L is present and can be eaten during t.

Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so from (5,1), moving left to (4,1) would be opposite, which is not allowed.

If the snake moves left to (4,1), since (4,1) is the body, but when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so if head moves to a cell that was body but will be vacated, it might be ok, except for the tail case.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is the second segment, not the tail.

Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. x=7 is wall, so (6,1) is not border, but internal obstacle at (6,4), which is not (6,1), so (6,1) should be empty.\n> \n> Is (6,1) occupied by body? Snake positions: let's see, all positions: from (5,1) to (5,2), etc., no (6,1), so empty. And not wall except borders and (6,4).\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle only at (6,4). So (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,1), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,2): which is tail, no food there, so should be safe.\n> \n> - R to (6,1): empty cell, safe.\n> \n> D to (5,0): wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (4,1): body, invalid.\n> \n> So only U or R are possible without dying immediately.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (4,2) at (4,2) with L=4, so must eat by turn 79.\n> \n> - (1,3) at (1,3) with L=7, eat by 82.\n> \n> - (1,2) at (1,2) with L=10, eat by 85.\n> \n> But (4,2) is close and will disappear soon.\n> \n> Also, snake head at (5,1), and (4,2) is just above? (4,2) is at x=4,y=2.\n> \n> From (5,1), moving U to (5,2) would be adjacent to (4,2)? (5,2) is north of (5,1), and (4,2) is west of (5,2)?

(5,1) to (4,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (5,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (5,2)\n> \n> - South: (5,0) wall\n> \n> - West: (4,1) body\n> \n> - East: (6,1) empty\n> \n> (4,2) is not adjacent to (5,1); it's diagonally northwest, but not directly adjacent. To reach (4,2), need to go west and north or something.\n> \n> From (5,1), to go to (4,2), one way: first to (5,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is adjacent to (5,2) west.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) and (1,2) are at left side.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (5,2), that's the tail, so after move, the head is at (5,2), and tail moves. Where does tail move? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> Current tail is at (5,2). If head moves to (5,2), since it's the tail, the head occupies (5,2), and the tail segment moves to the previous position of the second last segment? Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them: s0: (5,1) head, s1: (4,1), s2: (3,1), s3: (3,2), ..., s17: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to a new position, say to P, then new head is P, new body: s0 becomes body at (5,1), then s1 at (4,1), ..., up to s16 at (5,3)? s16 is (5,3), s17 is (5,2).\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Specifically: new positions: head at new pos, then segment 1 at old head pos, segment 2 at old segment 1 pos, ..., segment k at old segment k-1 pos, and the last segment (tail) is not there anymore, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Snake has N segments. When moving without eating, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated, so the new snake has head at new pos, body at old head, old body1, ..., up to old body N-2, and the old tail is gone? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment moves away, and the cell it was in is empty.\n> \n> The number of segments remains the same only if food is eaten; otherwise, it stays the same length, but the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose snake segments: H, B1, B2, ..., T.\n> \n> After move to new head position H', the new segments are: H' (new head), H (now body), B1 (now body), ..., up to the second last, and T is removed? No.\n> \n> B1 was at position, say P1, B2 at P2, ..., T at PT.\n> \n> After head moves to H', the new body segments are: the old head position becomes the new first body segment, old B1 becomes new B2, ..., old second last becomes new tail.\n> \n> So the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> The length remains the same unless food is eaten; if food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (5,2), which is currently the tail position.\n> \n> Current tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2), and no food there, then since it's moving to the tail, and no food, the new head is at (5,2), which was tail, and the new body includes the old head (5,1) as first body, then the rest, but the old tail (5,2) is now head, and the segment that was before tail, which is (5,3), becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Let's list:\n> \n> Current: positions: 0: (5,1) H, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,4), 12: (4,4), 13: (4,5), 14: (5,5), 15: (5,4), 16: (5,3), 17: (5,2) T\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2) which is current T, and no food eaten, then new head is at (5,2).\n> \n> The new body segments: old head (5,1) becomes body1, then old body1 (4,1) becomes body2, old body2 (3,1) becomes body3, ..., up to old body16 (5,3) becomes body17, and old body17 (5,2) is now head, so the tail is now at old body16 position, which is (5,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,2), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) new tail.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) was tail, now head, and tail moved to (5,3), so no collision.\n> \n> If there was food at (5,2), eating it would grow, so tail stays, and head at (5,2), but then the new tail would be at (5,2) after growth, but head is also there? Confusion.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, no food at (5,2), so moving to (5,2) is safe.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (6,1) is safe, empty.\n> \n> Now, back to food: (4,2) is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (5,2) west.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), then from there, I can move L to (4,2) to eat the food, since (4,2) has food.\n> \n> But I need to check if that causes danger.\n> \n> First, at turn 76, from (5,1), I can choose U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), then at turn 77, I can move L to (4,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Now, is there any risk?\n> \n> (4,2) is not under the snake body?

It's turn 77, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake is long; let me list the positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,2) facing Up.\n> \n> Body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> I should sketch this to visualize. The head is at (5,2), and it's facing Up. Moving Up would go to (5,3), but (5,3) is part of the body? Let's see: from positions, (5,3) is listed, yes, it's the second last position: positions are [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> So the tail is at (5,3), and head at (5,2). Facing Up, but Up from (5,2) is (5,3), which is currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> But according to the rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so it shouldn't be a collision unless it causes an issue.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, the tail is at (5,3), and head is at (5,2), so they are adjacent vertically. Now, is there food on the tail? Food positions: (4,2,3,1), (1,3,6,1), (1,2,9,1)\n> \n> (4,2) is a food position? But (4,2) is not the tail; tail is (5,3). Food at (4,2) with value 1, life span 3.\n> \n> (1,3) value 1, life span 6; (1,2) value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> No food on the tail cell (5,3), so moving to tail should be safe.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so if I move U, I go to (5,3), which is the tail. After moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food; otherwise, the tail moves off.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten, moving to (5,3) should be fine; the tail was there, but it moves, so head occupies (5,3), and new tail is the previous second last segment.\n> \n> But let's confirm the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), etc., tail (5,3).\n> \n> If I move U to (5,3), the new head position is (5,3), and since no food eaten, the tail (which was (5,3)) is removed, so the new tail becomes the segment before it, which is (5,4)? Positions: after head, it's (5,1), but let's list indices.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (5,2), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (3,1), index 4: (3,2), index 5: (2,2), index 6: (2,3), index 7: (2,4), index 8: (2,5), index 9: (2,6), index 10: (3,6), index 11: (3,5), index 12: (3,4), index 13: (4,4), index 14: (4,5), index 15: (5,5), index 16: (5,4), index 17: (5,3)  // tail\n> \n> If head moves to (5,3), which is current tail, and no food, then new head is (5,3), and we remove the last segment, which was (5,3), so the new snake is: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (5,4)] but (5,4) was index 16, which becomes the new tail? Let's see: positions from index 0 to 17, 18 segments.\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (5,3), so new position 0: (5,3), then previous 0 to 16 become positions 1 to 17, but since we remove the last, we keep positions 0 to 16, with new head at (5,3), and body from (5,2) to (5,4), but (5,4) was second last, now last.\n> \n> Specifically: new snake: head (5,3), then body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n> \n> Yes, so (5,3) is now head, and tail is (5,4), so no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, moving U to (5,3) is safe.\n> \n> Now, are there other options? Possible moves from (5,2): U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is the second segment, which would cause collision because it's body, not tail. D to (5,1) is down, y decreases, since y=2, D to (5,1) which is index 1, body segment. Moving to any body segment except tail is deadly.\n> \n> L to (4,2), but (4,2) is not in positions? Positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (4,2), so L to (4,2) should be free? But there might be food or wall.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (6,4).\n> \n> (4,2): x=4, y=2, not border, not (6,4), so should be empty or food.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) with value 1, life span 3.\n> \n> R to (6,2), x=6, y=2, not border, not (6,4) which is y=4, so (6,2) should be free? No food there.\n> \n> Foods: (4,2), (1,3), (1,2), no (6,2).\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,2) facing U:\n> \n> - U: to (5,3) - tail, safe\n> \n> - D: to (5,1) - body segment, collision, deadly\n> \n> - L: to (4,2) - possible, has food? (4,2) is food position with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - R: to (6,2) - empty, no food\n> \n> But head direction is U, and rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is U, which is up. Opposite is D (down). So I cannot move D, because it would be reverse.\n> \n> So from U, cannot move D.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> U: to (5,3) - tail, safe, no food\n> \n> L: to (4,2) - has food? (4,2) has food, value +1, so eating it would grow snake\n> \n> R: to (6,2) - empty, no food\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the food: (4,2) with life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=77, food at (4,2) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 79? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 77, life span 3, so:\n> \n> After turn 77, countdown to 2 (if not eaten)\n> \n> After turn 78, countdown to 1\n> \n> After turn 79, countdown to 0, disappears before or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1. When L=1, after the turn it is eaten or decreased to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Typically, if not eaten during turn, after the turn, countdown--, and if 0, disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, during the turn, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for (4,2), at turn 77, life span 3. If not eaten on turn 77, after turn 77, life span becomes 2. Then after turn 78, life span 1. After turn 79, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 77, 78, or 79.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 6, can be eaten turns 77 to 82.\n> \n> (1,2) life span 9, turns 77 to 85.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,2), facing U.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,2), I eat the food immediately, since (4,2) has food. Value +1, so snake grows: after moving to (4,2), head is at (4,2), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, and all body segments, tail remains. So snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (5,3)] but (5,3) was tail, now it stays, and a new segment added? No: when food eaten, head moves to new cell, and body follows, but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Specifically: old snake: positions S0 to S17, 18 segments.\n> \n> After eating food: new head at food cell, then S0 to S17 become the body, so 19 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)  // now 19 segments, tail at (5,3)\n> \n> But (5,3) was previously tail, now it's still there.\n> \n> Now, after this move, head is at (4,2), and direction was U, but I moved L, so new head direction is L?

Positions: (3,2) is there, but (4,2) is missing.\n> \n> List: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), ... so between (4,1) and (3,1), no (4,2). (4,2) is not occupied by snake? Food at (4,2), so it must be free or under body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, is (4,2) occupied?

Therefore, food at (4,2) is on an empty cell, I think. But food positions are given, so (4,2) has food, and since it's not in snake positions, it should be accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) and (1,2) are not in snake positions, so they are on free cells.\n> \n> Now, (4,2) is at (4,2), head at (6,2), so to reach it, we need to go left, but currently blocked.\n> \n> Moreover, (4,2) has life span 2, so only available for this turn and next.\n> \n> Current turn 78, so if we don't eat it this turn or next, it's gone.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to move head to (4,2), but from (6,2), we can only go U or D now.\n> \n> Then next turn, if we go up or down, the snake body will move, so (5,2) might be free later.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front. The tail segment is removed, but if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Current tail is at (5,4), and when snake moves, the tail will move to where the second last segment was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if snake moves up from (6,2) to (6,3), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Then segments: (6,2) becomes the new position for the second segment, so (5,2) moves to (6,2)?

Immediate moves are constrained to avoid deadly collisions, and subsequent actions navigate towards the food at (1,2), which has the longest life span (8 turns), while avoiding the inaccessible food at (4,2) and the time-sensitive (1,3). The sequence for turns 78 to 83 is:\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 78: U\n> Turn 79: L\n> Turn 80: U\n> Turn 81: U\n> Turn 82: L\n> Turn 83: D\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> **Main Thinking Conclusion:** Prioritized immediate survival by moving up to avoid a dead end, then navigated towards the long-lasting food at (1,2) (life span 8) by clearing a path through body segments, as (4,2) was unattainable and (1,3) could not be reached before expiration.\n",

Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, the snake can only be in cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). That's 18 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning moving towards increasing y. Since head is at (6,3) and direction is U, it was moving up to (6,3) from (6,2)? Positions are given head first: (6,3) is head, then (6,2) is the next segment, so the snake was moving down to (6,2)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc. So from (6,3) to (6,2) is down? But head direction is given as U, which might be the current facing direction.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse, so since it's facing U, it cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life_span 4?

But the core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. This might be a mistake or special?

Subsequent upward moves (turns 80-81) prevent immediate trapping, and shifting left then down (turns 82-83) opens space for future exploration. The high-value food at (5,2) is under the body and unlikely to be eatable within its lifespan due to body occupancy and movement constraints, so long-term survival is prioritized over this reward.\n",

Disappears after turn 83, so not available on turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life 6: can be eaten turns 80 to 85, disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> (5,2) life 9: turns 80 to 88.\n> \n> But (5,2) is currently under snake body, so cannot be eaten until body moves away.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 18 cells, so moving around might be tricky.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,5), no food there, so not immediate issue.\n> \n> First, I need to decide on immediate action.\n> \n> From (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) or U to (5,4).\n> \n> If I go L to (4,3), that moves the head to (4,3), and the tail will move, so the body segment at (5,2) might move, but (5,2) has food, but since head is moving away, it doesn't eat yet.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), the snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc. Tail moves from (4,5) to (3,5) or something? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and length increases.\n> \n> Since no food eaten this turn, when head moves to (4,3), the segment at (5,3) becomes new neck, (6,3) becomes next, and so on, tail (4,5) is removed, so the body segment at index 1 (6,3) moves to where head was?

Conclusion\n> The sequence prioritizes moving to open areas (up and left) to avoid immediate body collisions and create space for future maneuvers, while setting up a path to target the (1,2) food with 6 turns remaining. Avoiding the risky (1,3) food due to time constraints and body-blocked paths ensures long-term survival.\n",

It's turn 81, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), with body segments following. The snake is long; let's count the positions: from (5,4) to (4,4), that's 18 segments. Positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. That's 18 positions, so the snake length is 18.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so it's moving upwards, meaning from (5,4) to (5,3) was the previous move? Positions: head at (5,4), then (5,3), so if head is at (5,4) and direction is U, that means it just moved to (5,4) from (5,5) or something? Let's see the positions: the list is head first, so at turn 81, head is at (5,4), and it moved Up to get there, so previous position was (5,5)? But (5,5) isn't in the positions; positions start from (5,4) down to (4,4). Direction is given as U, which is the current head direction, meaning it's facing Up, so it can move Up to (5,5), but y increases Up? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume, with (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, or bottom-left, y increases up? I need to clarify.\n> \n> In the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but since U is (x,y+1), and D is (x,y-1), it might be that y=0 is the bottom, so U increases y, moving up. But in coordinates, it's arbitrary, but for movement, we just need to know the relative positions.\n> \n> Food positions: three foods given:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food? Value is 1, which is positive, so +1 reward, and length increases. But there's a note about negative food with penalty -1, but here all are value 1, so all positive. Life span: for (1,3), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" So at turn 81, for (1,3), life span 3, so it will disappear at the end of turn 83? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 81, life span is 3, meaning after this turn, it becomes 2, then after turn 82, it becomes 1, after turn 83 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 81, 82, or 83.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 5, so disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> (5,2) life span 8, disappears after turn 88.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,4), direction U, so it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since direction is U, reverse is D, so it cannot move Down immediately. So possible moves: U, L, R. (since D is opposite to U).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No: border cells are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So, valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)\n> \n> (4,4) is the tail.\n> \n> Food at: (1,3), (1,2), (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied by snake body? (5,2) is in snake positions: (5,2) is the fifth position in the list, so it's a body segment. Similarly, (1,3) and (1,2) are free, I think.\n> \n> (1,3): is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,3) is there, but (1,3) not listed, so free. Similarly (1,2) not listed, free. (5,2) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, as per rules. So (5,2) has food with value 1, life span 8. But it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment, so to eat it, that segment must move away, and then head must move to (5,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods are on free cells.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) – is this valid? (5,5): x=5, y=5, within 1-6? y=5, grid y from 1 to 6, y=5 is valid. Is it wall? No walls except borders and (6,4). (5,5) not wall. Occupied? Snake positions: (5,5) not in list, so free? Let's see: positions have (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (5,5), so free. But is it within bounds? x=5, y=5, min x=1, max x=6, min y=1, max y=6, so (5,5) is valid and free. But direction U, moving to (5,5).\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) – (4,4) is the tail? Snake positions: (4,4) is the last one, tail. Now, moving to tail is allowed because tail will move away, so head can move to where tail is now, and since tail moves, it should be ok, no collision. But only if the tail moves, meaning the snake is moving forward.\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) – (6,4) is an internal obstacle, wall. So cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: but D is opposite to U, cannot do instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, or R, but R to (6,4) is wall, so not possible. So only U or L.\n> \n> R to (6,4) is invalid because (6,4) is obstacle.\n> \n> So from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n> \n> L to (4,4) is the tail position.\n> \n> Now, if I move L to (4,4), since (4,4) is tail, and tail will move, so no collision, and snake grows only when it eats food, but here no food at (4,4), so it just moves, tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the foods.\n> \n> Food at (1,3): value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 83, else disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 5, by turn 85.\n> \n> (5,2) life span 8, by turn 88, but it's under body now.\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied by snake body at position (5,2) in the list, which is the fifth segment.\n> \n> Now, to eat (5,2), the snake must move such that the body at (5,2) moves away, and then head moves to (5,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, head at (5,4), body at (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc.\n> \n> The segment at (5,2) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Let me simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4) now.\n> \n> Is there food at tail? (4,4) is tail, but food positions are (1,3), (1,2), (5,2), no food at (4,4), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5), new head position (5,5), then snake body: the tail will move to the next position? When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So if move U to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), and tail was (4,4), which moves to where? The body segment that was at (3,4) moves to (4,4)? Let's list the current positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (5,4) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,3)\n> \n> 3: (6,2)\n> \n> 4: (5,2)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (3,1)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (2,2)\n> \n> 10: (2,3)\n> \n> 11: (2,4)\n> \n> 12: (2,5)\n> \n> 13: (2,6)\n> \n> 14: (3,6)\n> \n> 15: (3,5)\n> \n> 16: (3,4)\n> \n> 17: (4,4) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5) without eating (since no food there), the new snake: head at (5,5), then the previous positions from index 0 to 16 become the new body, so (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), and tail (4,4) is removed, so new tail is (3,4)? Index 16 was (3,4), which becomes the second last, and new tail is (4,4) removed, so positions: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] so tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (4,4), head to (4,4), but (4,4) is current tail, so no food, just move: head to (4,4), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), ..., up to (3,4), and tail (4,4) is removed? Current positions: head (5,4) to tail (4,4). After moving head to (4,4), the new head is (4,4), then the body is from index 0 to 16: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), and tail is removed, so new tail is (3,4). So positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4).\n> \n> In both cases, the tail moves from (4,4) to elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think about getting food, especially the one with short life span.\n> \n> (1,3) has life span 3, so it must be eaten by turn 83.

It's turn 82. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (6,4). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4).

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 82, life span 2 means it will be there for turns 82 and 83, gone on turn 84? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will be available until turn T + L - 1, and gone on turn T + L. For example, at turn 82, life span 2: it decreases to 1 on turn 83, and gone on turn 84. Similarly, life span 4 at turn 82: decreases to 3 on turn 83, 2 on 84, 1 on 85, gone on 86.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,1): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 82.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,4), direction L, so last move was left. Since direction is L, and we just moved left to (4,4) from previous position. Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (5,4), which is to the right, so yes, moving left to (4,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Allowed moves: U, D, L (since L is same direction, not reverse), but reverse is opposite, so from L, opposite is R, so cannot move R. Can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state. I should sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Let's see, snake has (2,3), (3,2), etc. (1,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free, but might be under body? No, food can spawn under body, but in this case, is (1,3) under snake? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. (2,3) is at x=2,y=3, so (1,3) is different cell. Similarly, (1,2) not occupied, (5,2) is occupied by snake? Snake has (5,2), which is a body segment at (5,2). Food at (5,2) is listed, but snake body is at (5,2), so the food is under the snake body at (5,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): snake has (6,2), (6,3), but not (6,1), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is under the snake body.

So can only move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, check each for collision:\n> \n> - Move U to (4,5): is this wall? y=5, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=5<7, not wall. Internal obstacle at (6,4), not (4,5). Snake body: list of positions, (4,5) not in the list? Positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), etc. (4,5) not there, so safe? But need to see if it's occupied. Current body: from (5,4) down to (3,4), no (4,5), so (4,5) is empty. But we have food? No food at (4,5). So moving U to (4,5) is safe.\n> \n> - Move D to (4,3): y=3, not wall. Snake body: (4,3) not in positions? Positions: (5,3) at (5,3), (6,3) at (6,3), no (4,3). So (4,3) empty, safe.\n> \n> - Move L to (3,4): (3,4) is the tail! Tail is at (3,4). Now, moving to tail: since the tail will move forward, it might be safe, but we have to be careful with the Tail Reward Danger rule.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, head at (4,4) is adjacent to tail at (3,4), and the tail cell (3,4) has food? Food positions: (1,3), (1,2), (5,2), (6,1). No food at (3,4). So (3,4) is just the tail segment, no food. So moving to (3,4) should be safe because the tail will move away when we move forward.\n> \n> When we move to a cell, if it's not food, snake moves, tail is cut off. If it is food, snake grows, tail stays or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, snake grows by one, so the tail doesn't move. When no food, head moves, tail is removed.\n> \n> But here, with the Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is the tail position. If I move to (3,4), since no food there, the head moves to (3,4), and the tail is removed, so the new snake positions: head at (3,4), then body from (4,4), (5,4), etc., minus the old tail.\n> \n> Positions: after move L to (3,4):\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Since no food, tail is removed, so the segment at (3,4) was tail, but now head is there, and tail is the previous one? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake was: positions [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (3,4) ] with (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (3,4): head to (3,4), and since no food, the tail (which was at (3,4)) is removed? But head is moving to (3,4), which is where tail was.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to new position. If no food, the tail is removed from the end. So the cell where tail was becomes empty.\n> \n> But here, head is moving to the tail cell. Since no food, the tail is removed, so effectively, the snake moves, and the tail cell is vacated, so head moving to it is fine; it doesn't collide because at that moment, tail is still there but about to be removed.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But in this case, when no food, tail moves forward means it is removed, so the cell is free.\n> \n> Similarly, with food, if you eat, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,4) has no food, so moving to it should be safe.\n> \n> Moreover, Tail Reward Danger only applies if the tail cell has food, which it doesn't.\n> \n> So move L to (3,4) is safe.\n> \n> Now, also, (5,4) is the second segment, but if I move R, I can't because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So all U, D, L are possible from (4,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n> \n> Foods: (1,3) with short life span 2, so it will disappear soon. (1,2) has life span 4, longer. (5,2) is under snake body, so we need to move the body away to eat it. (6,1) is far, long life.\n> \n> Also, (5,2) is under body, at (5,2), which is occupied by snake segment. In positions, (5,2) is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (5,2), so (5,2) is position 5 in the list.\n> \n> To eat (5,2), we need the snake to move so that the body leaves (5,2), and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, since (1,3) has short life, I might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But head is at (4,4), (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and down? x=1,y=3, head at x=4,y=4, so to go to (1,3), I need to go left and down, but there are obstacles.\n> \n> Path to (1,3): from (4,4) to (1,3). Possible ways: go left to (3,4), then to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied by body? Snake has (2,4) as a segment. Positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), etc. So (2,4) is occupied now.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is tail, but if I move left, I go to (3,4), which is tail, and after move, tail is removed.\n> \n> After moving left to (3,4) at turn 82, new head at (3,4), tail removed, so snake positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — and (3,4) was tail, removed, so (3,5) is now tail?

position, so pos6_{t+1} = pos5_t = (5,2)\n> \n> pos6_{t+1} = pos5_t = (5,2), so the cell (5,2) is occupied by pos6_{t+1}, which is the segment that was at pos5_t.\n> \n> But the position is the same, so the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> To have (5,2) vacant, I need that no segment is at (5,2) in the new positions.\n> \n> That means that pos6_{t+1} is not (5,2), which requires that pos5_t is not (5,2), but it is.\n> \n> Since pos6_{t+1} = pos5_t, and pos5_t = (5,2), so pos6_{t+1} = (5,2), so it is occupied.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (5,2) is if the segment that is there moves away, but in this case, it doesn't because the position is assigned to a new segment.\n> \n> For the cell to be empty, I need that in the new state, no segment has that position.\n> \n> For (5,2), at time t, it is pos5_t.\n> \n> At time t+1, the position pos5_t is occupied by pos6_{t+1}, so it is still occupied.\n> \n> The cell is only vacated if the tail is removed and it was the tail position, but here it's not.\n> \n> In this case, for an under-body food, to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves that cell, which happens when the segment moves to a different cell, but in a turn where the head moves, the segments shift, but the cell may be reoccupied.\n> \n> In practice, for a body cell, it can be freed if the snake moves in a way that the segment at that cell moves to the previous position, and if that previous position is different, it leaves, but then the cell might be occupied by the next segment if it was moving there, but in this case, since the indices shift, the cell is occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> But for the purpose of the food, if the cell is occupied by a body segment, the food is under it and can't be eaten until the body moves away and the cell is empty.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,2), it is occupied, so to eat it, I need a turn where after the move, (5,2) is not occupied by any snake segment.\n> \n> That means that no segment has position (5,2) in the new state.\n> \n> In the new state, the positions are new, so (5,2) is free if it is not in the new position list.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head, and after the move, (5,2) is not in the new positions, then it is free.\n> \n> In the current setup, (5,2) is pos5_t.\n> \n> After move, new positions include pos6_{t+1} = pos5_t = (5,2), so it is in the new positions as pos6_{t+1}, so occupied.\n> \n> To have it free, I need that pos5_t is not in the new position list, which only happens if it is the tail and removed, but here it's not the tail.\n> \n> So for a middle body segment, the cell it occupies will be reoccupied by the next segment in line after a move, so it never becomes empty unless the snake shortens or something, but with no food, it shortens at the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for a body cell, when the snake moves, the segment leaves, but the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment if the snake is dense, but in this case, since the segments are connected, when a segment moves, it leaves its cell, and the cell may be occupied by the following segment if it moves there, but in the shifting, the following segment moves to the cell of the current segment.\n> \n> For example, when segment i moves to the position of segment i-1, it leaves its cell, and at the same time, segment i+1 moves to the position of segment i, so it enters that cell.\n> \n> So the cell is vacated and then reoccupied instantly, so for the purpose of the game, it is still occupied, and food under it cannot be eaten.\n> \n> To eat food under body, the snake must move so that the body segment leaves and no other segment moves to that cell, which requires that the segment that was there is not followed by another segment moving to the same cell, but in a straight line, if the snake turns, it can leave cells empty.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,2), it is a bend, so it might be possible to free it.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head in a way that the segment at (5,2) moves to a different cell, and the segment that was behind it does not move to (5,2).\n> \n> Let's take a smaller example.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), tail at (1,3). So vertical.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) under body.\n> \n> If head moves right to (2,1), then new head (2,1), body1 at (1,1), body2 at (1,2), so (1,2) still occupied.\n> \n> If head moves down to (1,0), then new head (1,0), body1 at (1,1), body2 at (1,2), still occupied.\n> \n> To free (1,2), I need the snake to turn.\n> \n> Suppose head at (1,1), body at (1,2), tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Head moves right to (2,1), then new positions: head (2,1), body1 (1,1), body2 (1,2)\n> \n> (1,2) occupied.\n> \n> Then from there, if head moves right to (3,1), new head (3,1), body1 (2,1), body2 (1,1), then (1,2) is free.\n> \n> So after two moves, (1,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in this case, for (5,2), I need to move the snake so that the segment leaves and no one moves in.\n> \n> In the current state, from (4,4), if I move U to (4,5), then new head (4,5), body1 (4,4), body2 (5,4), body3 (5,3), body4 (6,3), body5 (6,2), body6 (5,2), so (5,2) still occupied.\n> \n> Then if I move L from (4,5) to (3,5), new head (3,5), body1 (4,5), body2 (4,4), body3 (5,4), body4 (5,3), body5 (6,3), body6 (6,2), then (5,2) is free because no segment there.\n> \n> Yes!\n> \n> After that move, (5,2) is empty.\n> \n> Then I can move to it later.\n> \n> In general, it takes a move to free the cell.\n> \n> For (5,2), with life span 7, plenty of time.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 82, I should move in a way that sets up for eating food or long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,1) with long life.\n> \n> And (1,2) with life 4.\n> \n> Since (1,3) has short life and I can't reach it easily, I might

Positions: (2,3) is there, but (3,3)? Let's see: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), etc. No (3,3) mentioned. So (3,3) should be free. Walls: x=0, y=0, etc., (3,3) is within bounds. Obstacle at (6,4), not here. So moving L to (3,3) should be safe.\n> \n> - R (right) to (5,3): (5,3) is in the snake positions! (5,3) is the fourth segment: positions index 3 is (5,3). Indices: 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), so (5,3) is a body segment. Therefore, moving R to (5,3) would cause collision with body, deadly. So R is not possible.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,3) with head direction D, possible moves are D or L. R is invalid due to body collision.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 1, so it disappears after this turn (turn 83). If not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 83 + 3 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 83, life span is 1 for (1,3), so if not eaten now, it vanishes after this turn. Similarly, (1,2) has life span 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one, so it will vanish after turn 85? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for (1,3): life span 1, so after this turn (turn 83), it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 83 or never.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): life span 3, so it disappears after turn 83 + 3 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is given, countdown includes current turn.\n> \n> Example: if at turn t, life span is N, then after N turns, it disappears. Meaning it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (1,3) at turn 83: life span 1, so it exists only on turn 83, disappears after turn 83, so if not eaten on turn 83, it's gone.\n> \n> (1,2): life span 3, so exists on turns 83, 84, 85, disappears after turn 85 (i.e., not available on turn 86).\n> \n> (5,2): life span 6, exists turns 83 to 88, disappears after 88.\n> \n> (6,1): life span 9, exists turns 83 to 91, disappears after 91.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is close to head at (4,3). But to eat it, I need to move to (1,3) this turn.\n> \n> From (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is possible, but (1,3) is two steps left, so I can't reach it in one move. From (4,3) to (1,3) requires moving left multiple times, but I can only move one cell per turn.\n> \n> So to eat (1,3) on this turn, I need to be at (1,3) now, but head is at (4,3), so impossible to eat (1,3) this turn. Therefore, (1,3) will disappear after this turn and can't be eaten. So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,2) at (1,2), (5,2) at (5,2), (6,1) at (6,1).\n> \n> (5,2) is at (5,2), which is occupied by the snake body! From positions: (6,2), (5,2), etc. (5,2) is the seventh segment: indices 6 is (6,2), 7 is (5,2)? Positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: (4,3) head\n> \n> 1: (4,4)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,3)\n> \n> 5: (6,2)\n> \n> 6: (5,2)  // here (5,2) is occupied\n> \n> 7: (5,1)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So (5,2) is occupied by the snake body at index 6. Therefore, food at (5,2) is under the body. According to rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) at (6,1), which is also occupied? Positions: (6,1)? Positions have (5,1) at index 7, (6,3) at 4, (6,2) at 5, no (6,1). (6,1) is not in the list. Food at (6,1), value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> Is (6,1) occupied? Snake positions: (4,1), (3,1), etc., no (6,1). So (6,1) is free, but food is there.\n> \n> (1,2) at (1,2), is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), etc., no (1,2), so free.\n> \n> But (1,2) has life span 3, so I have until turn 85 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move: I can go D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> If I go D to (4,2): that's down to (4,2). Is there food? No, food is at (1,2), (5,2), (6,1), not (4,2). So no food eaten.\n> \n> Then snake head moves to (4,2), tail moves... when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away from (3,5).\n> \n> After move D: head to (4,2), then body: segment 1 (4,4) to (4,3), segment 2 (5,4) to (4,4)? No: the positions shift.\n> \n> New positions: head new at (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body segment 1, previous segment 1 (4,4) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to previous segment 16 (3,5) becomes segment 17? Total segments 18, after move, if no food, length same, so tail is removed, so new tail is previous segment 17? Let's index.\n> \n> Current positions: 18 segments, indices 0 to 17.\n> \n> After move without eating food: new head at new position, then segments: position[0] new, position[1] = old[0], position[2] = old[1], ..., position[17] = old[16]. So old[17] (tail) is gone.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,3), 1: (4,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (3,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (2,4), 14: (2,5), 15: (2,6), 16: (3,6), 17: (3,5)\n> \n> If move D to (4,2), no food eaten.\n> \n> New positions: head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then body: [ old[0] which is (4,3), old[1] (4,4), old[2] (5,4), old[3] (5,3), old[4] (6,3), old[5] (6,2), old[6] (5,2), old[7] (5,1), old[8] (4,1), old[9] (3,1), old[10] (3,2), old[11] (2,2), old[12] (2,3), old[13] (2,4), old[14] (2,5), old[15] (2,6), old[16] (3,6) ]\n> \n> Old[17] (3,5) is gone. So new tail is old[16] (3,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2), direction was D, but after move, direction can change.\n> \n> If I go L to (3,3): head to (3,3), no food there.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), body: old[0] (4,3), old[1] (4,4), old[2] (5,4), ..., up to old[16] (3,6), old[17] gone.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for food.\n> \n> (5,2) has food under it, but it's occupied, so to eat it, I need the body to move away and head to move there later.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) has food, free, but I need to go there.\n> \n> (1,2) has food, free, but it's at (1,2), which is left and down.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,5), which is not near head now.\n> \n> Head at (4,3), tail at (3,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at borders and (6,4).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list occupied cells to see free space.\n> \n> Occupied: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,y) and (7,y) walls, (x,0) and (x,7) walls.\n> \n> So interior: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except walls.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> But (6,4) is obstacle, so not free.\n> \n> Free cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except snake positions and (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions cover many cells.\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (1,3) but (1,3) disappears after this turn, so ignore.

It's turn 84, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (3,3), and it's moving left (direction L). The body segments follow: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Let me list these out to visualize:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> That's 18 segments? Let me count: positions from index 0 to 17, so 18 cells. Snake length is 18.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn. Since current turn is 84, it will disappear after turn 86? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=3 at turn 84, it exists at turn 84, 85, 86, gone at turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life span 5: exists turns 84-88, gone at 89.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8: exists turns 84-91, gone at 92.\n> \n> Snake head direction is left, so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Current head at (3,3), moving left, so next position if continue left would be (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) is a body segment? Let's see the positions: snake positions include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. Specifically, (2,3) is the 13th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (3,2), 12: (2,2), 13: (2,3), 14: (2,4), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,6), 17: (3,6)\n> \n> So (2,3) is position index 13, which is a body segment. But since the snake moves, when the head moves to a new position, the tail moves away, so it might be safe to move into a cell that was occupied by the tail, as long as it's not another body part.\n> \n> The rule is: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it won't be there anymore when the head arrives.\n> \n> But in this case, (2,3) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,6). Let's find the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: last one is (3,6), so tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> (2,3) is a middle segment. If head moves to (2,3), which is currently occupied by a body segment, that would be a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> But (2,3) is not the tail; it's index 13. Tail is index 17 (3,6). So moving to (2,3) would cause a body collision because that cell is occupied and won't be vacated by the tail moving.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for a cell that is not the tail, if the head moves there, it will collide with the body segment still present.\n> \n> Specifically: after movement, the new head is at the new position, and the body shifts, so the old tail position is free, but other body positions are still occupied.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a non-tail segment, it's a collision.\n> \n> Only if moving to the current tail position, it might be safe if the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (3,6), so moving to (3,6) would be safe only if the snake is long enough that the tail moves.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; for now, possible moves from head (3,3):\n> \n> Current head at (3,3), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is left, I can move U, D, L, but not R (opposite direction), because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1).\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - L: left to (2,3). But (2,3) is currently occupied by body segment at index 13. Not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - U: up to (3,4). Is that occupied? Look at positions: (3,3) head, (4,3), (4,4), etc. (3,4) not listed, so probably free. Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied by snake: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> So (3,4) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D: down to (3,2). (3,2) is position index 11, which is a body segment. Not tail, so occupied.\n> \n> (3,2) is index 11, yes, body.\n> \n> R: right to (4,3), but (4,3) is index 1, body segment, occupied, and also, cannot move right because it's opposite direction? Direction constraint: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is L, so R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) - seems free\n> \n> - D: to (3,2) - occupied by body\n> \n> - L: to (2,3) - occupied by body\n> \n> - R: not allowed\n> \n> So only U is possible? But D and L are occupied, R not allowed, so only U?\n> \n> But (3,4) is free, yes.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), not relevant.\n> \n> So from (3,3), only possible safe move is U to (3,4).\n> \n> Is that right? (3,2) is occupied, (2,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied and not allowed to move there anyway.\n> \n> So yes, only U is safe.\n> \n> But let's think about the tail. Tail is at (3,6), which is far.\n> \n> Also, food positions: (1,2), (5,2), (6,1)\n> \n> (5,2) is currently occupied? Snake has (5,2) at index 7?

It's turn 85, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7, with walls at the borders). There's an internal obstacle at (6,4).

Let's check: snake has (5,2) in the list. Positions: after (6,2) is (5,2), so (5,2) is occupied by the snake. Similarly, (5,2) has food listed.\n> \n> But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) might be under or near the snake.\n> \n> List of snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n> \n> So (5,2) is occupied by the 9th segment?

Since head direction is Up, and it moved to (3,4) from (3,3), which is below, so it was moving Up.

Snake positions: (3,4) head, (3,3) next, then (4,3), etc. (3,5) not listed, so free? But walls: border y=0 and y=7, x=0 and x=7. (3,5) x=3,y=5, should be within bounds.

But is (3,5) free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (3,5) is within bounds. Walls: borders are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls, but (3,5) is not on border. Internal obstacle only at (6,4), not here. Snake positions: no (3,5), so it should be free.\n> \n> But moving to (3,5) would be Up.\n> \n> Then, after moving, the snake will have new head at (3,5), and the tail will move, so the segment at (2,6) will be removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, food: we have food at (1,2), (5,2), (6,1), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,2) is under snake body at index 8, so it can be eaten only if that body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,2) life span 2, so at turn 85, it has 2 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 86? Let's see: \"life_span decreases every turn including current\", so at turn 85, life_span=2, so after turn 85, it becomes 1, after turn 86, it becomes 0 and disappears.

(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> (5,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, the snake will keep moving, and each turn, the tail moves, so the body at (5,2) will eventually move when the tail advances.\n> \n> The segment at (5,2) is fixed until the snake moves past it.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the position (5,2) will be vacated when the tail part moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (2,5), and the body is coiled, so it might take many turns for (5,2) to be free.\n> \n> For instance, the segment at (5,2) will move to the next position when the snake moves.\n> \n> Let's think of the body as a sequence.\n> \n> The snake will move, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment when the head moves.\n> \n> So when head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for (5,2), it is occupied by a segment that will move to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> In the list, (5,2) is after (6,2), so when head moves, the segment that was at (6,2) moves to where the head was or something.\n> \n> After turn 85, the segment that was at (6,2) is now at position after head, but let's not complicate.\n> \n> The key point is that the cell (5,2) will be vacated only when the segment that occupies it moves away, which happens when that segment is no longer part of the body, i.e., when it becomes the tail and is removed, or when the snake eats food and it doesn't move.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten, each move, the tail is removed, so the last segment is removed, and the body shifts.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) is occupied by a body segment, and that segment will move to a new position when the snake moves, so the cell (5,2) is vacated only if that segment moves out and no new segment enters, but since the body shifts, when the segment at (5,2) moves to the position of the segment before it, the cell (5,2) becomes empty, and the new position is filled by the next segment.\n> \n> For example, in the current state after turn 85 move, positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,5) head\n> 1: (3,4)  -- this was previous head\n> 2: (3,3)  -- previous index 1\n> 3: (4,3)  -- previous index 2\n> 4: (4,4)  -- previous index 3\n> 5: (5,4)  -- previous index 4\n> 6: (5,3)  -- previous index 5\n> 7: (6,3)  -- previous index 6\n> 8: (6,2)  -- previous index 7\n> 9: (5,2)  -- previous index 8\n> 10: (5,1) -- previous index 9\n> 11: (4,1) -- previous index 10\n> 12: (3,1) -- previous index 11\n> 13: (3,2) -- previous index 12\n> 14: (2,2) -- previous index 13\n> 15: (2,3) -- previous index 14\n> 16: (2,4) -- previous index 15\n> 17: (2,5) -- previous index 16, tail\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied by index 9.\n> \n> When the snake moves on turn 86, say to a new position, new head added, tail removed.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to (3,6), then new head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) -- tail at (2,5), but (2,5) was index 17, removed, so new tail is (2,4)? Let's see: the segment that was at index 16 (2,4) is now at index 17, but after move, positions shift: new index 0: new head, say (3,6), index 1: (3,5) old head, index 2: (3,4) old index 1, index 3: (3,3) old index 2, index 4: (4,3) old index 3, index 5: (4,4) old index 4, index 6: (5,4) old index 5, index 7: (5,3) old index 6, index 8: (6,3) old index 7, index 9: (6,2) old index 8, index 10: (5,2) old index 9, index 11: (5,1) old index 10, index 12: (4,1) old index 11, index 13: (3,1) old index 12, index 14: (3,2) old index 13, index 15: (2,2) old index 14, index 16: (2,3) old index 15, index 17: (2,4) old index 16, and old index 17 (2,5) removed.\n> \n> So (5,2) is still occupied by index 10.\n> \n> Similarly, it will take many moves for the segment at (5,2) to move away. Specifically, the segment that occupies (5,2) will only leave when it becomes the tail, which is after many moves since the tail is at (2,4) in this new state, and (5,2) is index 10, so 10 steps away from head, but the distance to tail is shorter in terms of moves, but to vacate the cell, it needs the segment to move out.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different position, which happens every move, but the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment in line, so (5,2) is only empty if no segment is assigned to it, which only happens when the snake eats food and grows, or when the body moves in a way that the cell is skipped, but in normal movement, each cell in the body path is occupied at each step.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake is moving, the position (5,2) will be occupied until the tail part passes it, but because the body is not straight, it's hard.\n> \n> For example, in the current configuration, the snake has a loop, so (5,2) might be vacated when the tail advances past that point.\n> \n> But let's estimate how many turns.\n> \n> After turn 85, tail is at (2,5), and the body goes to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), etc.\n> \n> The segment at (5,2) is index 9, and the tail is index 17, so when the snake moves, the tail index increases for that segment, but the position changes.\n> \n> To vacate (5,2), the segment that is there must move away, and no new segment come in, but in a moving snake, when the head moves, all segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by a body segment may be vacated if that segment moves to a new position, and the next segment moves to the previous position, so the cell is only free if it was the tail position and tail moves away without new growth.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell occupied by body, it becomes free when the segment that was there moves out and no other segment moves in, which only happens for the tail cell when tail moves.\n> \n> For non-tail cells, when the snake moves, the body segments shift, so each body cell is left empty as the segment moves to the next position, but it is immediately filled by the following segment. So for a cell in the middle, it is always occupied during the move; it never becomes empty unless the snake changes shape.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,2), it is occupied by a segment that will move to the position of the segment before it when the head moves. When that happens, the cell (5,2) is vacated, but at the same time, the following segment may move into it if it was the next position, but in the shift, the segment moves out, and the previous segment of that moves in, so the cell may be empty for a moment, but in terms of game state, after each move, the positions are updated, so the cell is empty only if no segment is at that position after the move.\n> \n> For example, after a move, the new positions are set, so if a cell is not in the new position list, it is empty.\n> \n> For (5,2), in the state after turn 85, it is occupied.\n> \n> After turn 86 move, if head moves, new positions are set, and (5,2) may still be occupied or not, depending on how the body shifts.\n> \n> In the sequence above, after turn 86 if head moves to (3,6), then new position for index 10 is (5,2) (old index 9), so (5,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, it will be occupied until the segment that is there becomes the tail and is removed.\n> \n> The segment at (5,2) is index 9 in after turn 85 state. The tail is index 17. Each move, this segment moves to a new position, and its index decreases relative to head, but the position changes.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be free when that particular segment is no longer at (5,2), which is immediately after the next move, but it moves to a different cell, and the cell (5,2) may be occupied by another segment or not.\n> \n> In this case, when the snake moves, the segment that was at (5,2) moves to where the previous segment was, which is (6,2) in this case, so it moves to (6,2), and the cell (5,2) is then occupied by the segment that was at (5,1), which moves to (5,2), so (5,2) is still occupied, just by a different segment.\n> \n> So in a snake, body cells that are not the head or tail are always occupied; they never become empty during normal movement without eating.\n> \n> The only way a body cell becomes empty is if the snake eats food and grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the body doesn't shift for that cell, or if the snake moves and the tail moves away from a cell.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell like (5,2), it is occupied continuously until the tail of the snake moves past it, meaning when the last segment that was at (5,2) is removed as tail.\n> \n> In this case, the segment currently at (5,2) will be at different positions as the snake moves, but the cell (5,2) itself may be vacated when no segment is on it, which can happen if the snake's path changes.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body no longer occupies (5,2), but in this position, (5,2) is part of the body, so as long as the snake doesn't straighten or something, it might remain occupied.\n> \n> But in this specific configuration, the snake has a knot or something, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> From the list, after turn 85: positions from head to tail: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> So the path goes from (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5)\n> \n> So (5,2) is between (6,2) and (5,1), so when the snake moves, the segment at (6,2) moves to (6,3)? When head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> For example, when head moves to new position, the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for index 9 (5,2), when head moves, it will move to where index 8 was, which is (6,2), so it moves to (6,2), and index 10 (5,1) moves to where index 9 was, which is (5,2), so (5,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at (5,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is always occupied by some segment until the tail moves past it.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,5), and the body goes to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), so (5,1) is occupied, and it moves to (5,2) when the snake moves, so (5,2) is continuously occupied.\n> \n> (5,2) will be vacated only when the segment that is moving to it is not there, which can happen if the snake changes direction and the body path changes.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body no longer goes through (5,2), but in this case, since the snake is long and coiled, it might take many turns for (5,2) to be free.\n> \n> To eat the food at (5,2), I need to have the head move to (5,2) when it is empty, which requires that no body segment is on it at that turn.\n> \n> So I need to arrange that when the head moves to (5,2), the cell is free.\n> \n> But from above, (5,2) is currently occupied and will be for some time.\n> \n> Since the food has life span 4, it might be possible, but I need to plan a path.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 85, I must move U to (3,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 86, from (3,5), I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Moving U to (3,6) might be safe, but then I'm going up, and the grid is small.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,5) which is tail, safe.\n> \n> Moving R to (4,5), free.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2) is about to disappear, but I can't reach it in time. From (3,5) to (1,2) is at least 3 steps in x and 3 in y, so 6 moves, but at turn 86, it has life span 1, so can be eaten on turn 86 only if I move there, but it's too far, so impossible to eat (1,2). It will disappear after turn 86.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) food is under body, life span 4, so I have until turn 88 to eat it.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 7, (1,6) life span 10.\n> \n> (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the current tail area.\n> \n> After turn 85, tail at (2,5), so (1,6) is adjacent to (2,5)? (2,5) and (1,6) are not adjacent; (2,5) to (1,6) is |2-1| + |5-6| =1+1=2, so distance 2.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (1,6) are (1,5), (1,7) but y=7 wall, (0,6) wall, (2,6), (1,5) etc.\n> \n> (2,6) is not occupied now, after turn 85, positions have (2,5) tail, (2,4), etc, no (2,6), so (2,6) is free.\n> \n> (1,6) has food.\n> \n> So to eat (1,6), I can move the head there.\n> \n> From current head at (3,5), after turn 85.\n> \n> At turn 86, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), which is tail.\n> \n> Then from (2,5), on turn 87, I can move to (2,6) or (1,5) or (3,5) or (2,4), but (2,4) is body.\n> \n> If I move to (2,6) on turn 87, then I can eat the food at (1,6) on turn 88 if I move there.\n> \n> Let's plan.\n> \n> Turn 85: move U to (3,5)  -- only choice\n> \n> Then turn 86: from (3,5), I move L to (2,5)  -- (2,5) is tail, safe.\n> \n> After move, new head at (2,5), new body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) and tail removed, old tail was (2,5), but moved to, so new tail is (2,4)? Positions after turn 86 move to (2,5):\n> \n> Head moves to (2,5), which was tail, so new head (2,5), body: (3,5) old head, (3,4) old index 1, (3,3) old index 2, (4,3) old index 3, (4,4) old index 4, (5,4) old index 5, (5,3) old index 6, (6,3) old index 7, (6,2) old index 8, (5,2) old index 9, (5,1) old index 10, (4,1) old index 11, (3,1) old index 12, (3,2) old index 13, (2,2) old index 14, (2,3) old index 15, (2,4) old index 16, and old index 17 (2,5) was tail, removed, but head moved to it, so the segment at (2,5) is now head, and the body includes (3,5) down to (2,4).\n> \n> New positions: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> Tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Food at (1,6) is at (1,6), adjacent to head (2,5)?

So I cannot move right on this turn because it's the next turn after moving left. But the head direction is given as L, meaning it just moved left to (1,5), I assume. Let me see the positions: head at (1,5), previous was (2,5), so it moved from (2,5) to (1,5), so direction left. Therefore, for the next move, I cannot move right (opposite) instantly.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (1,6) – is this valid? y=6 is within 0 to 7, but walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall. Also, need to check if it's occupied by body or wall.\n> \n> - Down: to (1,4) – similarly, y=4, not wall.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,5) – but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,5) – but (2,5) is the first body segment, and also, moving right is opposite to current direction left, so not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are Up or Down.\n> \n> Now, (1,6) has food? Food at (1,6) is listed, with life span 7, value 1.\n> \n> (1,4) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> Also, need to check if moving to these cells is safe, meaning not colliding with body or wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (6,4). So for (1,6), x=1,y=6, not wall, and not occupied by body? Body positions: let's list all body cells except head.\n> \n> Body: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> (1,6) is not in this list, and not wall, so moving up to (1,6) is possible.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): not in body positions, not wall, so moving down to (1,4) is possible.\n> \n> Now, if I move up to (1,6), I eat the food there, since it's present. Food at (1,6) with life span 7.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,4), no food there.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a food at (5,2) with life span 2. But (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, specifically the 12th segment: positions index 11 is (5,2)? Let's see: positions list: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (5,2), 12: (5,1), etc.\n> \n> (5,2) is the 12th segment, which is part of the body. Food can be under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,4) is also under the body? (3,4) is position index 3 in the snake, so it's occupied.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) with life span 10.\n> \n> And food at (6,1) with life span 4.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: (5,2) and (3,4) are under snake body.\n> \n> (5,2) food has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=88, so for food at (5,2), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 88 + 2 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + L? Or end of turn?\n> \n> Typically, it decreases each turn, so if life span is N at turn t, after one turn, at turn t+1, life span is N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> But it doesn't specify when it disappears. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it means: at the current turn, life span is N, then after this turn, it decreases to N-1 for the next turn, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n> \n> But when exactly? For example, at turn t, life span N, it is present. After turn t, at the start of turn t+1, life span becomes N-1, and if N-1=0, it disappears before turn t+1 actions? I need to be consistent.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, since food can be eaten during the turn, I think: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. During the turn, if head moves to it, it is eaten. Then, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1 for all food. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, in the state, it's given for the current turn.\n> \n> In this case, turn 88, food at (5,2) has life span 2, so it will be present for turn 88 and 89, and disappear at the end of turn 89? Let's see.\n> \n> At turn 88: life span 2, so after this turn, it decreases to 1 for turn 89. After turn 89, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten in turn 88 or 89.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 4: present for turns 88,89,90,91, disappear after turn 91.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 7: present for turns 88 to 94, disappear after turn 94.\n> \n> (3,4) life span 10: present for turns 88 to 97.\n> \n> Now, back to possible actions for turn 88.\n> \n> From head at (1,5), direction L, can only move U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (1,6) – eats food there, since (1,6) has food. Then snake grows to length 19, head at (1,6), and the tail remains, so positions: new head (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), ... up to (2,3), and since it ate food, tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays, so positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)] with 19 segments.\n> \n> Then direction would be U.\n> \n> Option 2: Move D to (1,4) – no food, so snake moves, head to (1,4), then body follows: (1,5), (2,5), ... but since no food, tail moves away, so the last segment (2,3) is removed, head to (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) – let's list: after move down, head at (1,4), then previous head (1,5) becomes second, (2,5) third, ..., and since no food, the tail (2,3) is removed, so positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] with 18 segments, same length. Direction D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up to eat the food at (1,6).\n> \n> After eating, head at (1,6), direction U.\n> \n> From (1,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite) instantly.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (1,5) – but (1,5) is now the second segment, so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> L to (0,6) – x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,6) – not wall, and need to check if occupied.\n> \n> (2,6): is it in body? Current body after move: (1,5), (2,5), etc., (2,6) not listed, so probably empty, but let's see the grid.\n> \n> y=6, x=2, not in body positions above, and not wall, so R to (2,6) is possible.\n> \n> But after moving to (1,6), the body includes (1,5), which is adjacent, but moving to (1,5) would be down, which is opposite to current U, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (1,6) with direction U, possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, invalid; D to (1,5) body and opposite, invalid; L to (0,6) wall, invalid; R to (2,6) possible.\n> \n> Only one choice: must move right to (2,6).\n> \n> Then head to (2,6), no food there? Food at (1,6) eaten, (6,1), (3,4), (5,2) still there but under body or not.\n> \n> (2,6) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> After moving to (2,6), direction R.\n> \n> Then possible moves: from (2,6), direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n> \n> U to (2,7) wall, invalid; D to (2,5) – (2,5) is body segment; R to (3,6) possible? (3,6) not wall, not in body? Body: after previous, positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc. so (2,5) is fourth segment? List: after moving to (2,6): snake positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] if it grew earlier, but in this case, when it moved to (1,6), it ate food, so length 19, tail is (2,2) or something.\n> \n> After turn 88 move U to (1,6): positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) — (2,3) is the last segment.\n> \n> Then turn 89, move R to (2,6): now head to (2,6), no food at (2,6), so snake moves, tail moves away. New positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — tail (2,3) removed, so 18 segments again? After eating at turn 88, length 19, then turn 89 no food, so length decreases to 18? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so length increases. Then when it doesn't eat, it moves normally, tail moves, length same or decreases only if not growing.\n> \n> In this case: turn 88, move to (1,6) and eat, so length 19.\n> \n> Turn 89, move to (2,6), no food, so head moves to (2,6), body follows: the segment at (2,3) is removed, so positions from head to tail: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to (3,2), (2,2) — and (2,3) gone, so 18 segments? Let's count: from (2,6) to (2,2): positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 19 positions? (2,2) is the 19th? Let's index: 1. (2,6), 2. (1,6), 3. (1,5), 4. (2,5), 5. (3,5), 6. (3,4), 7. (3,3), 8. (4,3), 9. (4,4), 10. (5,4), 11. (5,3), 12. (6,3), 13. (6,2), 14. (5,2), 15. (5,1), 16. (4,1), 17. (3,1), 18. (3,2), 19. (2,2) — (2,2) is last, yes 19 segments. When no food, the tail moves away, so the last segment is removed, but here the last segment was (2,3) before, but after moving, (2,2) is still there, but (2,3) is gone.\n> \n> Before turn 89 move: positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,3) — 19 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,6), the new positions: head (2,6), then the previous head (1,6) becomes second, (1,5) third, and so on, up to the second last (2,2)? Previous positions: index 0: (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,3), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (5,2), 13: (5,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (3,2), 17: (2,2), 18: (2,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), then the body from index 0 to 17: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — and index 18 (2,3) is removed. So positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — still 19 segments? (2,2) is the last, but (2,3) is gone, and (2,2) is now the tail. Count: 1. (2,6), 2. (1,6), 3. (1,5), 4. (2,5), 5. (3,5), 6. (3,4), 7. (3,3), 8. (4,3), 9. (4,4), 10. (5,4), 11. (5,3), 12. (6,3), 13. (6,2), 14. (5,2), 15. (5,1), 16. (4,1), 17. (3,1), 18. (3,2), 19. (2,2) — yes 19, but when no food, the snake should not grow, so length should be 18. I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake eats food, on that move, the head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so length increases by 1. When it does not eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from last cell, so length remains the same.\n> \n> In this case, turn 88: move to (1,6) and eat, so after move, positions include the new head and all body, tail at (2,3), length 19.\n> \n> Turn 89: move to (2,6), no food, so head moves to (2,6), and the tail (2,3) is removed, so the new positions are from (2,6) to (2,2), but (2,2) was second last, now last, and (2,3) gone, so only 18 segments. Positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 19 cells? From (2,6) to (2,2): let's list indices: 0: (2,6), 1: (1,6), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (5,3), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (5,2), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (3,1), 17: (3,2), 18: (2,2) — 19 positions, but it should be 18 because no growth. I see the mistake: when no growth, the tail is removed, so the new snake has one less segment.\n> \n> Initial length before turn 88: 18 segments.\n> \n> Turn 88: eat food, grow to 19 segments.\n> \n> Turn 89: no food, so after move, head to new position, and tail removed, so back to 18 segments.\n> \n> Positions after turn 89 move: head at (2,6), then the first body segment is the previous head (1,6), then (1,5), then (2,5), and so on, up to the segment that was index 17 before move, which is (2,2), and the last segment (2,3) is removed. So the body ends at (2,2), with no (2,3). So positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 19 positions, but (2,2) is included, and (2,3) is gone, but (2,2) was already part of the snake, so it should be 18 segments from (2,6) to (3,2) or something.\n> \n> Let's list the positions before turn 89 move: after turn 88, snake: 0: (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,3), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (5,2), 13: (5,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (3,2), 17: (2,2), 18: (2,3)\n> \n> For turn 89, move head to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), then the body segments are from index 0 to 17 of previous: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — and index 18 (2,3) is removed. So new positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 19 cells, but (2,2) is the last, and it was index 17 before, now it's the tail, and (2,3) is gone. But the length is 19 because we added (2,6) and removed (2,3), but (2,6) is new head, and (2,3) was tail, so the number of segments is the same as before growth? Before turn 88, length 18, after turn 88 growth, length 19, after turn 89 no growth, length 18. Here we have 19 positions listed, but it should be 18. I think I have an off-by-one error.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake has a list of positions.

The new list has new head (2,6) and then S[0] to S[17], which is 18 positions, so total 19 positions, but S[0] to S[17] is 18 elements, plus new head, 19, and S[18] removed, so it's 19 positions, but since we removed one and added one, the length should be the same as before, 19?

It can be eaten if the snake moves away from (5,2) and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by the body, so the snake needs to move so that (5,2) is vacated, then head can move there.\n> \n> Life span 2, so it can be eaten in turn 88 or 89.\n> \n> Turn 88: if I can move to (5,2) this turn, but head is at (1,5), far away, impossible.\n> \n> So only possible in turn 89.\n> \n> At turn 89, if (5,2) is empty and head moves there.\n> \n> But (5,2) is currently occupied, so for it to be empty, the snake must move so that the segment at (5,2) moves away.\n> \n> In the current snake, (5,2) is position index 11 or 12, let's see the order.\n> \n> From head: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> So (5,2) is the 12th segment (index 11 if 0-based: head 0, (1,5)0, (2,5)1, (3,5)2, (3,4)3, (3,3)4, (4,3)5, (4,4)6, (5,4)7, (5,3)8, (6,3)9, (6,2)10, (5,2)11, (5,1)12, etc.\n> \n> So (5,2) is index 11.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position, so after one move, the segment at index 11 will be at the position of index 10, and so on.\n> \n> For (5,2) to be vacated, the tail must move, but it's not the tail; the tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> After one move, the body at (5,2) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's complicated.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be empty only if the segment that was there moves away and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the snake moves, the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated if no growth, or if the segment at that position moves.\n> \n> In general, for a body cell to become empty, the snake must move so that that segment is no longer there, which happens when the snake moves and that position is not reoccupied, but in a snake, the positions shift, so a particular cell is vacated when the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> For example, the cell (5,2) is occupied by the snake. It will be vacated when the snake moves and the segment that was at (5,2) moves to another position, and no new segment comes to (5,2), which is usually the case unless the head moves there or something.\n> \n> Specifically, after a move, if the snake does not grow, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> If it grows, no position is vacated.\n> \n> For (5,2), it is currently occupied. To vacate it, the snake needs to move without growing, so that the tail moves away.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,3), so after a move with no growth, (2,3) is vacated, but (5,2) is still occupied by the same segment or shifted.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at (5,2) will be at the position of the previous index 10, which is (6,2), and (5,2) might be occupied by another segment if the head moves in a way, but generally, positions change.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to simulate.\n> \n> At turn 88, if I move down to (1,4), no food, so snake moves, head to (1,4), tail (2,3) removed, so positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — 18 segments, with tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, (5,2) is still occupied, by the segment that was there, now at index 11: positions: 0:(1,4), 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,3), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2), 12:(5,2), 13:(5,1), 14:(4,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(3,2), 17:(2,2) — (5,2) is index 12? 0:(1,4), 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,3), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2), 12:(5,2), 13:(5,1), 14:(4,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(3,2), 17:(2,2) so (5,2) is index 12.\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> For (5,2) to be vacated, the tail needs to be at (5,2) or something.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be vacated when the segment that occupies it moves away and no other segment moves to it.

Only if some segment's new position is (3,4), which would be if the head moves there or another segment.\n> \n> But the head moves to a new cell, not to (3,4) unless we choose to.\n> \n> So if we don't move the head to (3,4), and no other segment is moving to (3,4), then (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> For example, in the move from (4,5) to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), which is new.\n> \n> Seg1: old position 0 (4,5)\n> \n> Seg2: old position 1 (3,6)\n> \n> Seg3: old position 2 (2,6)\n> \n> Seg4: old position 3 (1,6)\n> \n> Seg5: old position 4 (1,5)\n> \n> Seg6: old position 5 (2,5)\n> \n> Seg7: old position 6 (3,5)\n> \n> Seg8: old position 7 (3,4)  // so new position 8 is (3,4)?

Let's see:\n> \n> Old position 7 was (3,4), which is the position of segment 8? Positions: old position 7 is (3,4)\n> \n> New position 8 is old position 7, so new position 8 is (3,4)\n> \n> Similarly, it remains occupied.\n> \n> Unless the segment moves to a different cell, but in this case, the cell (3,4) is still occupied by the same segment or a different one, but it is occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (3,4), we need that no segment is assigned to it after the move, which means that it was the tail position and we move the tail away.\n> \n> But (3,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> So (3,4) will remain occupied until the tail reaches that area, which is far.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (3,4) because it's under the body and we can't free it without the tail moving there, but the tail is at (3,1), and as we move, it will take many turns to free (3,4).\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (3,1), and we need to move the snake so that the tail moves to (3,4) or beyond, but (3,4) is occupied, so it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move in a circle or something to free the cell.\n> \n> But it's complicated, and with the wall, it might be risky.\n> \n> Moreover, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> But in this case, no food on tail.\n> \n> But for (3,4), since it's under body, and we can't eat it, we should ignore it or find a way.\n> \n> But the rules say food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> But in practice, for a cell under body, to eat it, we need to move the snake so that the segment on that cell moves away, and then before another segment moves in, the head moves there.\n> \n> But since the snake moves in a coordinated way, it's hard to have a cell vacated and head move there in the same turn.\n> \n> Typically, when a segment moves away from a cell, the cell is vacated, and if the head moves to that cell in the same turn, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in the movement, the head moves first to a new cell, then the body segments move to the previous positions, so when the body moves, the cell it was on is vacated, but at that time, the head has already moved, so the head cannot move to that cell in the same turn because the cell was occupied at the start of the turn.\n> \n> Let's think about the turn sequence.\n> \n> At the start of turn, the grid has food and snake positions.\n> \n> If a cell has food and is occupied by body, it cannot be eaten because the head is not on it.\n> \n> When we choose to move, the head moves to a new cell. If that new cell has food and is free, it eats it.\n> \n> But if the cell has food but was occupied by body, at the start, it is occupied, so head cannot move there because of collision.\n> \n> After the head moves, the body segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by the tail or other segments may be vacated, but the food there can only be eaten if the head moves to it, which can only happen in a future turn when the cell is free.\n> \n> So for a cell with food under body, we need to move the snake so that the body leaves that cell, making it free, and then in a subsequent turn, the head can move to it to eat the food.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,4), we need to move the body away, so that (3,4) is free, then move head there.\n> \n> But with the current position, (3,4) is deep in the body, so it will take many turns for it to be free.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (3,4) will move when the snake moves, but the cell (3,4) will be occupied by the next segment until the tail passes.\n> \n> The distance from the tail to (3,4) is several cells, so it will take at least that many moves for the tail to reach the area.\n> \n> Current tail at (3,1), (3,4) is 3 cells away in y, but not straight path.\n> \n> Positions: (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), so (3,3) is position 8, (3,4) is 7, etc., so when the snake moves, the tail at (3,1) will move to (3,2) or something.\n> \n> It will take many turns for (3,4) to be vacated.\n> \n> Life span is 6 after turn 91, so about 6 turns, but it might be possible, but risky.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move the head towards the tail to shorten the snake or something.\n> \n> But the priority is survival.\n> \n> Another idea: there might be no other food, so we need to eat this food to score, but since all food is +1, and we can survive, but with the internal wall, the space is limited.\n> \n> Grid size: 6x6, but (6,4) blocked, so 35 cells, snake length 19, so 16 free cells, but some occupied by food, but food is on body, so free cells are available.\n> \n> We can move around to survive.\n> \n> But to maximize score, we need to eat food.\n> \n> But the only available food is (3,4) with life span 6, but it's under body.\n> \n> Perhaps we can eat the food at (6,1) if we can reach it, but it's gone.\n> \n> After turn 91, (6,1) is gone.\n> \n> So only (3,4) left.\n> \n> But let's assume we can free (3,4) in a few turns.\n> \n> For example, from current state after turn 91, head at (4,5), we can move down or something.\n> \n> But we are at (4,5), moving to (5,5) on turn 92.\n> \n> Then from (5,5), we can move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n> \n> If we move U to (5,6), then head to (5,6), direction U.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U invalid, D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) occupied, R to (6,6) free.\n> \n> So only R to (6,6).\n> \n> Then to (6,5), etc., as before.\n> \n> If from (5,5) move R to (6,5), then head to (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Then from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6) free, D to (6,4) wall, invalid, L to (5,5) occupied, R invalid.\n> \n> So only U to (6,6).\n> \n> Then from (6,6), only D to (6,5) occupied, so dead end, and we die when we have no move.\n> \n> From (6,6), move D to (6,5), but (6,5) is previous position, occupied, so collision or no move.\n> \n> After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), seg1 (6,5) if we came from (6,5), etc.\n> \n> So from (6,6), U invalid, D to (6,5) occupied, L to (5,6) occupied, R invalid, so no valid move, game over.\n> \n> So going to (6,6) is death.\n> \n> Therefore, we must avoid going to the right edge.\n> \n> On turn 91, from (4,6), we should move D to (4,5) instead of R to (5,6).\n> \n> Then on turn 92, from (4,5) move R to (5,5).\n> \n> Then on turn 93, from (5,5), we have choices U or R.\n> \n> But R to (6,5) is dangerous, as it leads to (6,6) death.\n> \n> U to (5,6) also leads to (6,6) death.\n> \n> So both are bad.\n> \n> From (5,5), we can only move U or R, both lead to death eventually.\n> \n> D to (5,4) is occupied, L to (4,5) occupied.\n> \n> So no good move.\n> \n> But earlier, from (4,5), we moved R to (5,5), but at (4,5), we could have other moves?

It's turn 90. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (6,4).

Let's check: snake positions include (3,4)? From the list: (3,5), then (3,4), yes, (3,4) is a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is a food position, but is it occupied? Snake has (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), but not (6,1). (6,1) is free, I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,1) and (3,4). But (3,4) is part of the snake body. According to rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (3,4), it's currently occupied by a body segment. Let's see what segment: positions: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (1,6), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), so (3,4) is the 5th segment, which is not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,2), which is the last one.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, including current turn. So on turn 90, life span 8, so it will be there until turn 97? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, so it's present for turns t to t+N-1.\n> \n> At turn 90, life span 8, so it appears on turn 90 and lasts until turn 97? Disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t+N it's gone? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, the countdown starts at L and decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases including current turn, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown = L, so it has L turns left, including current.\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown = L-1, and so on.\n> \n> - When countdown = 1, it is present during that turn, and disappears after, so not available next turn.\n> \n> - When countdown = 0, it has disappeared.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume: on turn when food is spawned, countdown = N.\n> \n> After that turn, countdown = N-1.\n> \n> After N-1 more turns, countdown = 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So total, it is present for N turns: from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it is present only on turn t, disappears immediately after.\n> \n> If N=2, present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> So here, at turn 90:\n> \n> Food at (6,1): life span 3, so present on turns 90, 91, 92. Disappears after turn 92.\n> \n> Food at (3,4): life span 8, so present on turns 90 to 97. Disappears after turn 97.\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by snake body. Specifically, it's the segment at position index 5: (3,4).\n> \n> The snake will move, so if the body moves away from (3,4), and later the head moves there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,1), which is not occupied now.\n> \n> (6,1) is adjacent to the snake? Snake has (5,1) and (6,2), (6,3), etc. Let's see the grid.\n> \n> I should sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders, so accessible area is (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But since it's cells occupied, we can't move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n> \n> So free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (6,4) is blocked.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (6,4) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,6)\n> \n> Then: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> (5,4) is listed, but (6,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) is ok, but cannot go to (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (6,1) and (3,4).\n> \n> (6,1) is a cell: x=6,y=1. Is it wall? No, walls are at borders, but (6,1) is not border wall, since x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, y=1 not y=0 or y=7, so (6,1) is accessible, except if obstacle, but obstacle is only (6,4), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), direction right, so last move was to the right to (2,6). From where? Previous head was probably (1,6), since positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), so it moved from (1,6) to (2,6) on this turn or previous? Positions are given for turn t1=90, so snake is at these positions now.\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning it is facing right, and the move that brought it here was to the right, I assume.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6): up, down, left, right.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction?

But y=6, and walls only at y=7, so y=6 is ok. But is it a border? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine. Similarly, no obstacle at (3,6), only (6,4) is obstacle.\n> \n> So (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, up from (2,6): (2,7)? y=7 is wall, since border y=7. So cannot move up.\n> \n> Down from (2,6): (2,5). Is (2,5) occupied? Snake has (2,5) at index 3? Positions: index 0: (2,6) head, index 1: (1,6), index 2: (1,5), index 3: (2,5), so (2,5) is the third segment, so occupied, cannot move there, body collision.\n> \n> Right to (3,6): as above, not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> Left: but cannot, because reverse from R.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> U: (2,7) which is y=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (2,5) occupied by body, invalid.\n> \n> R: (3,6) free, valid.\n> \n> So from (2,6), only possible move is R to (3,6).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so U is invalid.\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied by snake body at index 3, so yes, collision if move there.\n> \n> L is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> R to (3,6): let's confirm if (3,6) is free.

It's turn 93. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the edges and at (6,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So the snake has 19 segments. Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right last turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Life span means how many turns left before they disappear, including the current turn. So for (3,4), life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 98 (since current is 93, 93+5=98? Let's calculate: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, so after turn t + N - 1 or something? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, life span N means it will disappear after N more turns, so it's gone at turn t + N. For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only on this turn.\n> \n> For (3,4): life span 6 at turn 93, so countdown: turn 93:6, 94:5, 95:4, 96:3, 97:2, 98:1, 99:0? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1. When L=1, after the turn, it disappears. So for (3,4) with L=6 at turn 93, it can be eaten from turn 93 to 98, and disappears after turn 98.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) with L=8, can be eaten from turn 93 to 100, disappears after turn 100.\n> \n> Now, both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but I should think more to maximize score with survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), so from (4,6) to (5,6), so it moved right to (5,6), so current direction is R.\n> \n> Since head direction is R, and no instant reverse, I cannot move left (opposite) on next turn.

Internal obstacle is (6,4), not (5,5). So (5,5) should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (5,5) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, right: (6,6) – x=6, y=6, not border, not (6,4), so should be free?

(4,6) is the segment after head, so if head moves left to (4,6), it would collide with body immediately, since (4,6) is occupied by body and not the tail segment that is about to move.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,1), so (4,6) is a body segment that will not move immediately when head moves; only the tail moves when head eats food or just moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail segment is removed. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away. But if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, (4,6) is the second segment, not the tail. So if head moves to (4,6), it would be moving to a cell occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other body cells except tail are deadly.\n> \n> Now, for (5,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) - y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) - let's check if occupied. Snake positions: (5,5) not listed, so free. Not wall.

Valid.\n> \n> (6,4) is wall, but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> So possible actions: Down (D) or Right (R). Cannot go Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R, so moving Right is same direction, Down is perpendicular, both allowed since not opposite.

(5,4) is segment 15 in the list, which is part of the body.

The head is at (4,5), and all adjacent cells—(3,5) to the west, (5,5) to the east, (4,6) to the north, and (4,4) to the south—are occupied by body segments. None of these cells is the tail (which is at (6,3)), so moving to any adjacent cell results in a body collision and immediate death. The head direction is left, so moving right (reverse) is not allowed. No safe move exists at turn 97, leading to game over regardless of the chosen action.\n> \n> ### Action Sequence\n> Given the lack of safe moves, the snake must choose an action, but all choices lead to collision. For completeness, down (D) is selected arbitrarily for turn 97, resulting in death. No further turns are possible.\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 97: D\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> No safe move exists at turn 97 due to all adjacent cells being occupied by non-tail body segments, forcing a collision; long-term survival is impossible, and the game ends immediately.\n",
