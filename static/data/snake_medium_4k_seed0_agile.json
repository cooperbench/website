        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Snake Initial State**: \n   - Positions: Only the head is at (3, 3).\n   - Direction: Currently moving Left (L).\n3. **Walls**: \n   - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n4. **Food**: \n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Objective\n\nThe goal is to decide the immediate action (U/D/L/R) for the snake to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Since the snake is currently moving Left (L), I need to consider the possible moves and their consequences.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the snake can move:\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2, 3)\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3, 2)\n\n**Note**: The snake cannot reverse its direction instantly, so Right (R) is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) → (2, 3)\n- **Position**: (2,3)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - x=2 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7.\n  - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle but not (2,3).\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - No food at (2,3).\n- **Check for Collision**: \n  - Snake body is only at (3,3), so no collision.\n- **Result**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) → (3, 4)\n- **Position**: (3,4)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - x=3 is within 0-7, y=4 is within 0-7.\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, but (3,4) is not listed.\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - No food at (3,4).\n- **Check for Collision**: \n  - No body segments to collide with.\n- **Result**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) → (3, 2)\n- **Position**: (3,2)\n- **Check for Walls**: \n  - x=3 is within 0-7, y=2 is within 0-7.\n  - No internal obstacles at (3,2).\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - No food at (3,2).\n- **Check for Collision**: \n  - No body segments to collide with.\n- **Result**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (3,5): Above the current head.\n2. (2,2): Below and to the left.\n3. (4,3): To the right.\n\nSince the snake is moving Left, moving Right is not allowed. So, (4,3) is not accessible immediately.\n\n#### Option to Reach (3,5)\n- Current position: (3,3)\n- To reach (3,5), need to move Up twice.\n- First move: Up to (3,4).\n- Second move: Up to (3,5).\n- However, (3,4) is safe, but need to ensure that after the first move, the second move is possible.\n\nBut for the immediate turn, moving Up doesn't give any reward but sets up for future reward.\n\n#### Option to Reach (2,2)\n- Current position: (3,3)\n- To reach (2,2), need to move Left and then Down or Down and then Left.\n- First move: Left to (2,3).\n- Second move: Down to (2,2).\n- Again, immediate move Left doesn't give reward but sets up for future reward.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate vs Future Rewards\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe but don't provide any reward, the best strategy is to choose a move that positions the snake closer to the food for future turns.\n\n- **Option 1**: Move Up towards (3,5).\n- **Option 2**: Move Left towards (2,2).\n\nBoth options are valid. However, (3,5) is two steps away, and (2,2) is also two steps away. \n\nBut, moving Left is in the current direction, which might be more straightforward. However, since the snake is just a single segment, changing direction doesn't have any immediate consequences.\n\n### Considering the Current Direction Constraint\n\nThe snake is moving Left, but it's allowed to change to Up or Down. Since the snake is only one segment long, changing direction doesn't pose any risk of collision.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both Up and Left are safe and lead towards food, but neither provides an immediate reward, I can choose either. However, moving Left maintains the current direction, which might be simpler.\n\nBut, looking at the internal obstacles:\n- Moving Up to (3,4) is safe, but next move to (3,5) is also safe.\n- Moving Left to (2,3) is safe, but next move to (2,2) is safe as well.\n\nBoth paths seem equivalent. However, moving Up might be better because:\n- The food at (3,5) is directly above, and the path is straightforward.\n- The path to (2,2) involves a diagonal movement, which might be less direct.\n\nBut, since the snake is only one segment, it's flexible. \n\n### Final Choice\n\nI think moving Up is a good choice because it's a clear path towards the food at (3,5). \n\nBut, looking again, moving Left is also good. Maybe it's better to stick to the current direction unless there's a reason to change.\n\nGiven the initial direction is Left, and no immediate reward is available, it might be better to continue Left to maintain consistency.\n\nHowever, since the snake is just starting, changing direction is not an issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering both options, I think moving Up is a better choice because it's a direct path towards the food at (3,5), and the snake is free to change direction since it's only one segment long.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are additional cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (3,5), body at (3,4). So, the snake is two segments long.\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2,2): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (4,3): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (6,4): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Current direction is U, so the opposite direction D is not allowed next.\n\n**Allowed moves**: U, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (3,5)\n- New head position: (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is a border wall, so (3,6) is not a wall. No internal obstacles at (3,6).\n  - **Body**: Snake body is at (3,4). New head (3,6) doesn't collide with body.\n- **Food**: No food at (3,6).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is a border wall, (2,5) is not a wall. No internal obstacles at (2,5).\n  - **Body**: (2,5) is not part of the body.\n- **Food**: No food at (2,5).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a border wall, (4,5) is not a wall. No internal obstacles at (4,5).\n  - **Body**: (4,5) is not part of the body.\n- **Food**: No food at (4,5).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. However, we should consider future moves to maximize score. Let's see where the food is:\n\n1. (2,2): To reach here from (3,5), the snake would need to move left and down. But moving down is not allowed next (current direction is U, opposite is D). So, not immediately accessible.\n2. (4,3): To reach here, the snake could move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), but (4,4) is an internal obstacle. So, this path is blocked.\n3. (6,4): To reach here, the snake could move right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then down to (5,4), then right to (6,4). But (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is not blocked directly. However, this is a multi-step plan and we're only deciding the immediate action.\n\nGiven that none of the immediate moves lead to food, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Considering Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake is only two segments long: head at (3,5) and tail at (3,4). The tail is adjacent to the head (directly below). If there were positive food at the tail, eating it would be dangerous because the head would grow into the tail's position, and the new tail would be where the head was, causing a collision. However, in this state, there's no food at the tail (3,4), so this isn't a concern.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nSince all immediate moves (U, L, R) are safe and don't lead to food, we can choose any. However, we might want to position the snake closer to food for future turns.\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,6) doesn't seem advantageous as it's moving away from all food.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,5) is closer to (2,2), but still not directly helpful.\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,5) is closer to (4,3) and (6,4), but (4,3) is blocked by (4,4).\n\nGiven that, moving Left might be slightly better as it's towards (2,2), but it's not a clear advantage. Alternatively, moving Right could be better for (6,4), but it's a longer path.\n\nSince all moves are equally safe and none immediately lead to food, we can choose any. To keep it simple, let's continue in the current direction unless there's a reason not to.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nContinue moving Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 3\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: head at (3,6), body at (3,5)\n   - Current direction: Up (U)\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2,2): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (4,3): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (6,4): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since it's currently moving Up (U), it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (3,6)\n- New head position: (3,7)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a border wall → collision!\n  - Body: (3,5) is the only body segment, and (3,7) is not (3,5) → no body collision.\n- Outcome: Hits the wall → deadly collision. Not a valid move.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (3,6)\n- New head position: (2,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - Border walls: x=2 is not 0 or 7 → no border wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (2,6) which is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - Body: (2,6) is not (3,5) → no body collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - (2,6) is not listed as a food position → no food to eat.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (3,6)\n- New head position: (4,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls:\n    - Border walls: x=4 is not 0 or 7 → no border wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (4,6) which is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - Body: (4,6) is not (3,5) → no body collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - (4,6) is not listed as a food position → no food to eat.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 4. Move Down (D) - Not Allowed\n- Current direction is Up, so Down is the reverse direction → not allowed in the next move.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLet's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable soon or if moving towards them is beneficial:\n\n1. (2,2): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (3,6): |3-2| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - Not reachable in this move.\n\n2. (4,3): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (3,6): |3-4| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Life span is 1 → disappears after this turn.\n   - Not reachable in this move.\n\n3. (6,4): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (3,6): |3-6| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Life span is 1 → disappears after this turn.\n   - Not reachable in this move.\n\nNone of the foods can be eaten in this immediate move since they're all too far away and will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food that could be dangerous to eat.\n\n- Tail position: (3,5)\n- Head position: (3,6)\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), (3,6)\n- Head is at (3,6), which is adjacent to tail at (3,5).\n- Is there food at the tail? \n  - Tail is at (3,5). Checking food positions: none at (3,5).\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Right\n\nBoth Left and Right moves are safe with no immediate reward. To decide between them, let's think about future moves:\n\n- **Left to (2,6)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (2,6):\n    - Current direction would be L, so can't go R next.\n    - Possible: U, D, L\n    - U to (2,7): y=7 is wall → invalid\n    - D to (2,5): \n      - Check walls: (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed → safe\n      - Body: next body would be (3,6) (old head), but snake length is 2, so tail moves away → no collision\n    - L to (1,6):\n      - Check walls: x=1 is not a border, no internal obstacles at (1,6) → safe\n      - Body: (3,6) is not (1,6) → safe\n\n- **Right to (4,6)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (4,6):\n    - Current direction R, so can't go L next.\n    - Possible: U, D, R\n    - U to (4,7): y=7 is wall → invalid\n    - D to (4,5):\n      - Check walls: (4,4) is an obstacle, but (4,5) is not → safe\n      - Body: (3,6) is not (4,5) → safe\n    - R to (5,6):\n      - Check walls: (5,6) is an internal obstacle → collision!\n      - So R is invalid next move.\n\nBetween Left and Right, Left seems slightly better because from (2,6), both D and L are safe next moves, whereas from (4,6), only D is safe next move (R leads to obstacle).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**, as it's safe and offers more flexibility in the next move compared to moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, we must consider:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the last move was Left, we cannot move Right immediately (that would be reversing direction).\n   - So, cannot move Right (R).\n\n2. **Wall and obstacle collisions**:\n   - Moving Left (L): (1,6)\n     - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,6) is not a wall (x=1 is not in the internal obstacles list for y=6).\n     - Check snake body: The only body segment is at (3,6), so no collision.\n   - Moving Up (U): (2,7)\n     - y=7 is a border wall, so this is invalid (collision).\n   - Moving Down (D): (2,5)\n     - Check walls: y=5 is not a wall, and (2,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Check snake body: No body at (2,5).\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Left (L) or Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate Left (L) and Down (D):\n\n**Move Left (L) to (1,6)**:\n- New head position: (1,6)\n- Check for food at (1,6): No food listed at this position.\n- After moving, the tail moves from (3,6) to (2,6), so new snake positions: [(1,6), (2,6)].\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- Future considerations: Moving left from (1,6) would go to (0,6) which is a wall, so next move would have to be U or D.\n\n**Move Down (D) to (2,5)**:\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- Check for food at (2,5): No food listed here.\n- After moving, tail moves to (2,6), so new snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6)].\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- Future considerations: From (2,5), possible moves would be L, D, or R (not U, since that would reverse the current D move).\n\n### Checking for Food Accessibility\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (2,2): Far away, not immediately accessible.\n2. (4,3): Need to move right and down to reach.\n3. (6,4): Need to move right and down.\n4. (6,6): Currently at (6,6) is food with value=1, life=10.\n\nNow, the food at (6,6) is interesting because it's on the same row as the head (y=6). Currently, the head is at (2,6), and the tail is at (3,6). The food is at (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6), we'd need to move Right multiple times:\n- From (2,6), move R to (3,6): but (3,6) is the tail. \n  - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but here's a special rule:\n    - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n    - Currently, the tail is at (3,6), and the head is at (2,6), so they are adjacent (left of head is tail).\n    - If we move Right to (3,6), we'd be eating the food at (3,6) if it were there, but in this case, there's no food at (3,6), so this rule doesn't apply directly.\n    - However, moving Right to (3,6) is safe because:\n      - (3,6) is the tail, which will move to (2,6) next turn, so no collision.\n      - No food at (3,6), so no growth, length stays same, no new tail collision next turn.\n\nBut the food is at (6,6), not (3,6). So moving Right once to (3,6) is safe, but doesn't get us food yet.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), next move could be R to (4,6), then (5,6), but (5,6) is an internal obstacle (wall), so cannot go there. So path to (6,6) is blocked by wall at (5,6).\n\nTherefore, cannot reach (6,6) food currently due to wall at (5,6).\n\nOther foods:\n- (6,4): To reach, need to go down from (2,6) to (2,5), then right to (3,5), etc., but need to check walls.\n- (4,3): Similar path.\n- (2,2): Need to go down multiple steps.\n\nGiven that, immediate food access is limited.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nMoving Left to (1,6):\n- Next moves would have to be U or D (can't go L to (0,6) wall).\n- If U: (1,7) is wall.\n- If D: (1,5), which is safe but leads towards center where more options may be.\n\nMoving Down to (2,5):\n- Opens up more options to go L, D, or R next.\n\nBetween L and D, Down seems better as it keeps more options open for future moves, whereas Left leads towards a corner with fewer options.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to current head (2,6)?\n- (2,2): No\n- (4,3): No\n- (6,4): No\n- (6,6): No (not adjacent)\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move, so prioritize safety and future options.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Down:\n- Left: (1,6), but then limited next moves.\n- Down: (2,5), more flexibility next turn.\n\nAlso, no food to eat immediately, so no risk of tail reward danger.\n\n**Best immediate action**: Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 5  \n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at (2,5), then (2,6) (so the snake is two segments long, moving downward)\n- Current direction: D (Down)\n\n**Food:**\n1. (2,2), value=1, life_span=5\n2. (4,3), value=1, life_span=5\n3. (6,4), value=1, life_span=6\n4. (6,6), value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Snake's Current Movement\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D), meaning its head is at (2,5) and the next segment is at (2,6). The direction is important because we cannot make an instant reverse, i.e., we cannot move Up (U) next since that would be opposite to Down.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,5), moving Down would take us to (2,4). But let's check all possible moves:\n\n1. **Down (D):** (2,5) → (2,4)\n   - Check for walls: (2,4) is an internal obstacle! So this move is invalid (would collide with a wall).\n   \n2. **Left (L):** (2,5) → (1,5)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border, but (1,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (2,6), so no collision.\n   - Valid move.\n   \n3. **Right (R):** (2,5) → (3,5)\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is border, (3,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: No.\n   - Valid move.\n   \n4. **Up (U):** (2,5) → (2,6)\n   - Instant reverse: Current direction is D, so U is opposite. Not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate L and R based on food and potential risks.\n\n**Option 1: Left (L) to (1,5)**\n- Is there food at (1,5)? Checking the food list:\n  - (2,2), (4,3), (6,4), (6,6) — no, no food at (1,5).\n- Next possible moves from (1,5):\n  - Could lead towards food at (2,2) or (4,3) in future steps.\n- No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n**Option 2: Right (R) to (3,5)**\n- Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n- Next possible moves from (3,5):\n  - Could head towards (4,3) or (6,4) or (6,6).\n- Also no immediate reward, but safe.\n\nNeither move leads directly to food, but let's see which one positions us better to reach food next.\n\n**Path to Food:**\n- (2,2): From (2,5), need to go down to (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall. So can't reach directly.\n- (4,3): From (3,5), can go Down to (3,4), then Left to (2,4) — but (2,4) is wall. Or from (3,5), Down to (3,4), then Right to (4,4) — but (4,4) is a wall. Hmm.\n   - Alternatively, from (3,5), Right to (4,5), then Down to (4,4) — wall. Doesn't seem straightforward.\n- (6,4): From (3,5), Right to (4,5), Right to (5,5), Down to (5,4), Right to (6,4). But (6,3) is a wall, but (6,4) is okay.\n   - This seems possible but many steps.\n- (6,6): From (3,5), Right to (4,5), Right to (5,5), Right to (6,5), Up to (6,6). But (5,6) is a wall, but path seems okay.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,5):\n- To (2,2): Left to (0,5) is wall. Down to (1,4) — but (1,4) is a wall. So can't go that way.\n   - Seems hard to reach (2,2) from (1,5).\n- To (4,3): Right to (2,5), but already there. Not helpful.\n   - Maybe (1,5) Down to (1,4) — wall. Not possible.\n\nBetween L and R, moving Right seems to offer a better path towards food at (6,4) or (6,6) in future steps, whereas Left seems more constrained by walls.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger with moving Right to (3,5)?\n- No walls or body segments there.\n- No food there, so no risk of eating negative food or tail reward danger (since tail is at (2,6), not adjacent to (3,5)).\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (1,5) is also safe in terms of immediate dangers.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both L and R are safe, but R seems to offer a better path towards food in the future, I'll choose Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 6 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions: Head at (3,5), body at (2,5).\n- Current direction: Right (R). This means the snake was moving to the right to reach (3,5) from (2,5).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=8\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 score, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5), moving Right (R) would go to (4,5). But let's check all possible moves (U, D, L, R) considering:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move Left (L) next.\n- Must avoid walls and body collisions.\n\n**Available moves from (3,5):**\n- **Up (U)**: (3,5) → (3,6)\n  - Check (3,6):\n    - Not a wall: (5,6) is a wall, but (3,6) is not listed as a wall.\n    - Not part of the snake's body: body is at (2,5), so safe.\n- **Down (D)**: (3,5) → (3,4)\n  - Check (3,4):\n    - Not a wall: walls at y=0, but y=4 is not listed as a wall except for internal obstacles; (3,4) is not listed.\n    - Not part of the snake's body.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,5) → (2,5)\n  - But (2,5) is the current body segment. Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward, but let's see:\n    - Current body: [(3,5), (2,5)]. After moving L to (2,5), the new body would be [(2,5), (2,5)]? Wait, no:\n    - Original body: head at (3,5), body at (2,5).\n    - Move L to (2,5): new head at (2,5), tail was at (2,5), which moves to where? Actually, the tail would move away from its previous position, but since the head is moving to the tail's current position, and the tail moves forward, this is allowed unless it causes a collision next turn.\n    - However, the rule says you can move into the tail's current cell because the tail will move forward, so no immediate collision.\n    - But we also have to consider \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, the tail is at (2,5), and we're moving to (2,5), but is there food at (2,5)? No, food is at (2,2), (4,3), etc., not at (2,5). So no danger here.\n    - But is moving Left allowed given current direction is R? The rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So cannot move L next. So L is invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (3,5) → (4,5)\n  - Check (4,5):\n    - Not a wall: walls at x=7, but x=4 is not listed as a wall internally except at (4,4), but (4,5) is not (4,4).\n    - Not part of the snake's body.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R (L is invalid due to instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate U, D, R based on food proximity and safety.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (2,2): distance from (3,5) is |3-2| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. (4,3): |3-4| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n3. (6,4): |3-6| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n4. (6,6): |3-6| + |5-6| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nClosest is (4,3) with distance 3.\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (3,6)**\n- Next position: (3,6)\n- Distance to (4,3): |3-4| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 (same as current)\n- Distance to (6,6): |3-6| + |6-6| = 3 + 0 = 3 (closer to this food)\n- But (6,6) is at distance 3 now, same as (4,3).\n- Not directly moving towards any food, but not away either.\n- Safety: no immediate collision.\n\n**Option 2: Down (D) to (3,4)**\n- Next position: (3,4)\n- Distance to (4,3): |3-4| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 (closer)\n- Distance to (2,2): |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Moving towards (4,3).\n- Safety: no immediate collision.\n\n**Option 3: Right (R) to (4,5)**\n- Next position: (4,5)\n- Distance to (4,3): |4-4| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2 (same as D)\n- Distance to (6,4): |4-6| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- Also moving towards (4,3).\n- Safety: no immediate collision.\n\nBetween D and R, both move towards (4,3) equally (distance decreases by 1 in both cases). \n\nBut let's see the paths:\n- D to (3,4): next possible moves could be L to (2,4) - but (2,4) is a wall, so invalid; R to (4,4) - (4,4) is a wall; U back to (3,5) - but that's the body (but tail would have moved to (3,5) from (2,5), so head would be at (3,4), body at (3,5), so moving U to (3,5) would collide with body. So after D, next moves are limited.\n- R to (4,5): next possible moves could be U to (4,6), D to (4,4) - (4,4) is wall; L to (3,5) - but body would be at (4,5), (3,5), so moving L to (3,5) is moving into the tail's previous position, which is allowed unless there's food there (no food at (3,5)). So more options after R.\n\nSo R seems better for future flexibility.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to current head (3,5)?\nAdjacent cells:\n- (3,6): no food\n- (3,4): no food\n- (2,5): no food (body is there)\n- (4,5): no food\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move. So the goal is to move towards the closest food (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (4,3):\n- Need to decrease y by 2 and increase x by 1.\n- So D and R are the directions that help.\n\nBetween D and R:\n- D: (3,5) → (3,4) - then next move could be R to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall.\n- R: (3,5) → (4,5) - then next move could be D to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall.\n\nHmm, both seem to lead to a wall next. Maybe U is better to go around.\n\nAlternative plan: go up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then down towards (4,3).\n\nBut that's planning ahead, and we're to decide immediate action.\n\nGiven that both D and R lead to walls next, but R at least keeps more options open (from (4,5), can go U to (4,6)).\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nMoving D to (3,4):\n\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are additional cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (4,5), body at (3,5). So, the snake is 2 units long.\n   - **Current Direction**: Right (R). This means the snake was moving right in the previous turn.\n4. **Food Items**: Each has coordinates (x,y), life span, and value. All food here has a value of +1 (positive food). Their positions and life spans are:\n   - (2,2): life span 3\n   - (4,3): life span 3\n   - (6,4): life span 4\n   - (6,6): life span 7\n   - (1,5): life span 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot move Left (L) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move based on the next head position and check for collisions or food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (4,5)\n- New head: (4+1,5) = (5,5)\n- Check:\n  - **Wall**: x=5 is not a border wall (x=0 or 7 are borders). Check internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but (5,5) is not listed, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: Snake body is at (3,5). New head (5,5) does not collide with body.\n  - **Food**: Is (5,5) a food position? Checking the list: No. So, no food eaten.\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head: (4,5+1) = (4,6)\n- Check:\n  - **Wall**: y=6 is not a border (y=7 is). Internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but (4,6) is not, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: (3,5) is the body, new head (4,6) does not collide.\n  - **Food**: Is (4,6) food? No.\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head: (4,5-1) = (4,4)\n- Check:\n  - **Wall**: y=4 is not a border. Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle! So, this move would collide with the wall.\n- **Result**: Deadly collision, cannot move Down.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the current head (4,5) that we can aim for in the next move.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,5):\n- Right: (5,5) - no food\n- Up: (4,6) - no food\n- Down: (4,4) - obstacle, can't go\n- Left: (3,5) - body segment, but also has food?\n\nWait, the food list is:\n- (1,5): life span 10\n- Others are not near (4,5).\n\nActually, (3,5) is the body segment, not listed as food. So no food adjacent to head currently.\n\nBut let's look at the food positions:\n- (2,2), (4,3), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5)\n\nThe closest seems to be (4,3) and (1,5).\n\n(4,3) is two steps down from (4,5), but we can't move down directly due to obstacle at (4,4). So, to reach (4,3), we'd need to go around.\n\n(1,5) is to the left: from (4,5), left is (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5). But current direction is R, so next move can't be L. So can't go left immediately.\n\n(6,4) is to the right and down: from (4,5), R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then R to (6,4). But need to check obstacles:\n- (5,4): not an obstacle.\n- (6,4): not an obstacle, but (6,3) is, but that's below (6,4), so okay.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is right and up: (4,5)->(5,5)->(5,6): but (5,6) is an obstacle, so can't go that way.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nGiven that no food is immediately adjacent, and we can't reverse to left, the safe moves are R or U.\n\nBetween R and U:\n- R: moves towards (6,4) food, which is 3 steps away.\n- U: moves towards (6,6) food, but next step would be (4,6)->(5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so not helpful.\n\nSo, moving R seems better as it starts a path towards (6,4).\n\nAlso, moving R to (5,5) doesn't block any immediate paths and keeps options open for next moves.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe snake is only 2 long: head at (4,5), tail at (3,5). If we move R to (5,5), tail moves from (3,5) to (4,5), so new snake is [(5,5), (4,5)].\n\nIs there food under the tail (3,5)? Checking food list: no, (3,5) is not listed as food. So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most strategic move is to continue Right (R), as it avoids collisions and starts moving towards the food at (6,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 9  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions: [(6,5), (5,5)]  \n  - Head at (6,5), next segment at (5,5)\n- Current direction: R (right)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,2): value=1, life=1\n2. (4,3): value=1, life=1\n3. (6,4): value=2, life=1\n4. (6,6): value=5, life=1\n5. (1,5): value=8, life=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,5) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (6,6)\n- **D (Down)**: (6,4)\n- **L (Left)**: (5,5) - but this is the body segment, so it's a collision unless it's the tail.\n- **R (Right)**: (7,5) - but x=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n\n**Current direction is R**, so we cannot move L (left) next because that's the opposite direction (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nSo, valid moves are U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nLet's evaluate U and D:\n\n1. **Move U (Up) to (6,6)**:\n   - Check if (6,6) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not a border wall, y=6 is not a border wall (since y=7 is the border).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (6,6) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n     - Not colliding with body: Snake body is at (5,5), so (6,6) is safe.\n   - Food at (6,6): value=5, life=1.\n     - Eating this would give +5 to score and increase length by 1.\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: \n       - Current tail is at (5,5). Adjacent to head at (6,5): yes, (5,5) is adjacent (left).\n       - Is there positive food at (5,5)? No, food is at (6,6), (2,2), etc., not at (5,5).\n       - So no danger from tail reward.\n   - After eating, new snake would be [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)].\n     - Next move would have to avoid moving back to (6,5) unless the tail moves away.\n   - Seems safe and high reward.\n\n2. **Move D (Down) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check if (6,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not border, y=4 is not border.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is not listed.\n     - Not colliding with body: body is at (5,5), so safe.\n   - Food at (6,4): value=2, life=1.\n     - Eating gives +2, length +1.\n     - Tail is at (5,5), adjacent to head at (6,5): yes.\n     - No food at (5,5), so no tail reward danger.\n   - After eating: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)].\n   - Reward is less than moving U.\n\nOther moves:\n- L (Left) to (5,5): collides with body (unless it's the tail), but current direction is R, so cannot move L next.\n- R (Right) to (7,5): wall, invalid.\n\n### Comparing U and D\n\n- U: +5 points, length +1.\n- D: +2 points, length +1.\n  \nU is clearly better in terms of immediate reward.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move U\n\nAfter moving U to (6,6):\n- New head at (6,6), body at (6,5) and (5,5).\n- Possible next moves from (6,6):\n  - U: (6,7) - y=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - D: (6,5) - body segment, but it's the immediate next segment, so collision unless tail moves.\n    - Tail is at (5,5), after moving U, tail moves from (5,5) to (6,5), so (6,5) is now body, not tail. So moving D would collide.\n  - L: (5,6) - check:\n    - (5,6) is an internal obstacle, so invalid.\n  - R: (7,6) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n  \nSo after U, the only possible move is D, but that collides. So the snake would be stuck unless it can find another path, but currently, it seems like a dead end after U.\n\nBut the rule is to decide the immediate action for current turn, not plan ahead. However, if moving U leads to certain death next turn, maybe it's not the best.\n\nAlternative is D to (6,4):\n- After D: head at (6,4), body at (6,5), (5,5).\n- Next moves from (6,4):\n  - U: (6,5) - body, but tail is at (5,5), so (6,5) is body, collision.\n  - D: (6,3) - obstacle, invalid.\n  - L: (5,4) - check:\n    - Not a wall, not an obstacle.\n    - Not body (body is at (6,5), (5,5)).\n    - Safe.\n  - R: (7,4) - wall, invalid.\n  \nSo after D, can move L to (5,4), which seems safe.\n\n### Re-evaluating U vs D\n\nU gives higher immediate reward but leads to a dead end next turn.\nD gives lower reward but allows continuation.\n\nBut the instruction is to decide the immediate action, not plan ahead. Maybe the AI is supposed to take the highest immediate reward unless it's certain death.\n\nLooking at the rules, \"Tail Reward Danger\" is if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, tail is at (5,5), no food there, so no danger from that.\n\nThe collision danger is only if head moves into body. After U, next turn the only move is D into body, but that's next turn's problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake can survive longer by not taking the highest immediate reward.\n\nBut given the instruction is to maximize score, and U gives +5 vs D +2, and no immediate danger from U, maybe U is better.\n\nWait, the food at (6,6) is under the snake's body? Snake is at (6,5) and (5,5), so (6,6) is not under body. So can eat it directly.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and D, U gives higher reward and no immediate danger. Even though it may lead to a dead end next turn, the current instruction is to decide the immediate action to maximize score.\n\n**Action**: U\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 10  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]  \n- Head at (6,6), then body at (6,5), tail at (5,5)\n- Current direction: U (up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4,3): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (6,4): value=1, life_span=1\n3. (1,5): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (3,2): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (6,6), current direction is U (up). The possible moves are:\n- U (up): (6,6) → (6,7)\n- L (left): (6,6) → (5,6)\n- R (right): (6,6) → (7,6)\nCannot move D (down) because that's the opposite of current direction U.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for validity and potential benefits.\n\n#### 1. Move U (Up) to (6,7)\n- Check walls: y=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly\n- **Invalid move**\n\n#### 2. Move L (Left) to (5,6)\n- Check walls:\n  - Not a border wall (x=0 is border, we're at x=5)\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle → collision → deadly\n- **Invalid move**\n\n#### 3. Move R (Right) to (7,6)\n- Check walls: x=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly\n- **Invalid move**\n\nHmm, all immediate moves seem to lead to collisions. This suggests that the snake is in a tricky position where all possible moves from (6,6) with current direction U are blocked.\n\nWait a minute, let me re-examine the snake's body to see if any moves might not actually collide with the body.\n\nSnake body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n- Moving to (6,7): wall\n- Moving to (5,6): obstacle\n- Moving to (7,6): wall\n\nBut the tail is at (5,5). Normally, moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail will move forward, but in this case, (5,6) is an obstacle, not the tail's next position.\n\nWait, is (5,6) part of the snake's body? No, the body is at (6,5) and (5,5). (5,6) is an internal obstacle, not body.\n\nSimilarly, (6,7) is a wall, (7,6) is a wall.\n\nSo all three possible moves lead to collisions. This seems like a dead end. But the snake must have a valid move, otherwise the game would be over. Maybe I'm missing something about the tail movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves forward. So if the head moves to a new position, the tail (currently at (5,5)) will move to where? The body is [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. After moving, the new body would be [new head, (6,6), (6,5)], and the tail at (5,5) is removed unless we eat food.\n\nBut since all moves lead to walls or obstacles, it seems the snake cannot move without dying. Maybe the initial assumption is wrong, and the snake can move into the tail's position if it's not blocked.\n\nWait, the rules say:\n- \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away. But in our snake, the tail is at (5,5), and possible moves are U/L/R from (6,6):\n- U: (6,7) - wall\n- L: (5,6) - obstacle\n- R: (7,6) - wall\n\nNone of these are the tail's position. The tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to the head at (6,6). Adjacent would be (5,6), (6,5), (7,6), (6,7). So no, tail is not adjacent.\n\nThis seems like a situation where all moves are invalid. Maybe the game is over, but since we're asked to provide a move, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, is the head direction restricting movement? The rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so cannot move D, but other directions are allowed.\n\nBut all allowed directions lead to walls or obstacles. Maybe the snake is trapped and must collide.\n\nBut the problem asks for an action, so perhaps the only possible action is one that leads to collision, and the AI must choose one, even if all are bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed that the snake can stay in place, but the rules say moves are U/D/L/R, no option to stay.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to choose any direction, even if it leads to death, since all do. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the internal obstacles are only the ones listed, and others are free. Let me re-examine the walls:\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo (5,6) is an obstacle, but (6,7) is a border wall (y=7), (7,6) is border wall (x=7), and (5,6) is internal obstacle. So all three moves are blocked.\n\nThis seems like a no-win scenario. Maybe the answer is to choose any direction, like R, even if it hits the wall.\n\nBut since all moves are equally bad, perhaps the answer is arbitrary. But the rules say to maximize score, so maybe choose the move that could lead to food if not for the wall, but here all are blocked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the food under the snake can be eaten if the body moves away. But the head is at (6,6), and food is at (6,4), (4,3), etc., none under the head.\n\nGiven that, it seems the snake has no valid moves and must collide. Since the AI must provide an action, I'll choose R, even though it hits the wall.\n\nBut before finalizing, let me check if any food is adjacent that could be eaten safely. Adjacent to head (6,6):\n\n- (5,6): obstacle\n- (6,5): body\n- (7,6): wall\n- (6,7): wall\n\nNo food adjacent. So no chance to eat food this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll possible moves (U, L, R) lead to immediate collision with walls or obstacles. There is no safe move available. Therefore, the AI must choose one of the directions, even though all result in death. \n\nGiven that, choosing R is as good as any.\n\n\\boxed{R}",
