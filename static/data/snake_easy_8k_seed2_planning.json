        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) probably being the bottom-left or top-left. I should assume (0,0) is bottom-left for consistency, but in grid terms, it might not matter as long as I'm consistent. Y=0 is the bottom or top? Typically in programming, y=0 is top, but here it says y=0/y=7 are borders, so I'll think of coordinates with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing upwards, but let's see the direction.\n\nSnake head direction is L, which is left, so decreasing x. Current position is (3,3). Food at (4,5,10,1), (3,5,10,1), (6,6,10,1). All food has value +1 and life span 10, so they're all positive food.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,6), which is a wall cell.\n\nSnake is just the head at (3,3), since positions are [(3,3)], so length 1. That means no body segments yet, so no collision risk except walls and itself if it grows, but for now, since it's only head, moving onto its own position might be bad, but the rules say body collision, but with only head, it can't collide with itself yet.\n\nThe snake positions list has one element, so snake length is 1. Therefore, when it eats food, it will grow to length 2.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nAvailable actions: Since head direction is L (left), I can move L (continue left), or turn to U or D, but not R, because R is opposite to L, and no instant reverse. So possible moves: L, U, D.\n\nIf I move L, to (2,3)\n\nU to (3,4)\n\nD to (3,2)\n\nNow, check for walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be wall collision.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,6), so that's a wall, can't go there.\n\nFood positions: (4,5), (3,5), (6,6)\n\nAll have life span 10, so they'll disappear after 10 turns, but since current turn is 0, they last until turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, since snake is short, I can easily move around.\n\nBut I should aim for food to grow and score points.\n\nAlso, avoid risks, like being trapped or colliding.\n\nNow, the tail reward danger: but since no tail yet, this doesn't apply. Tail reward danger only when head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but tail is the last segment, and when you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately, but grows.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut in this case, there is no tail, so not an issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but currently no body, so all food is accessible if I move to it.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases upwards, x increases right. That matches U: y+1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Bottom row: y=0\n\n- Top row: y=7\n\n- Left column: x=0\n\n- Right column: x=7\n\nInternal wall at (1,6)\n\nSnake at (3,3) facing left.\n\nFood: (4,5), (3,5), (6,6)\n\n(3,5) is directly above (3,3), since U is y+1, so (3,3) to (3,4) would be up, (3,5) is two up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is right and up from (3,3), and (6,6) is far.\n\nSince life span is 10, I have time, but I should start eating to grow.\n\nPossible immediate moves:\n\n- Left (L) to (2,3): no food, no wall. (2,3) is within bounds.\n\n- Up (U) to (3,4): no food, but closer to food at (3,5) or (4,5).\n\n(3,4) has no food, food is at (3,5) and (4,5).\n\n- Down (D) to (3,2): no food, away from food.\n\n(3,2) is down, no food there.\n\nAlso, walls: down to (3,2), y=2, not 0, so safe. Left to (2,3), x=2 not 0. Up to (3,4), y=4 not 7.\n\nAll safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I go up to (3,4), then next turn I could go to (3,5) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,5) has food, so moving to (3,5) would eat it.\n\nSince snake is length 1, after eating, it grows to length 2, and the tail will be at (3,3) or where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and if no eat, tail moves forward, but if eat, tail stays, so body grows.\n\nSequence: when snake moves to a cell with food, it eats, so length increases by one, and the new tail is added at the end, but since it ate, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the position where it was remains part of body.\n\nFor example, start at turn 0: snake at [(3,3)]\n\nMove to (3,4): no food, so snake becomes [(3,4)], since no grow, but length was 1, moving to new cell, so positions: head moves, tail moves? With length 1, if no eat, moving to new cell means the snake is now at that cell alone.\n\nI need to clarify snake movement.\n\nTypically in Snake, when the snake moves:\n\n- Head moves to new cell.\n\n- If no food eaten, tail moves to the next segment or is removed? With multiple segments.\n\nBut here, starting with single segment.\n\nWhen snake has one segment: moving to a new cell without eating: snake is now at the new cell, length still 1.\n\nMoving to cell with food: eats, length becomes 2, head at new position, tail at old position.\n\nThen next move, head moves, if no eat, tail moves to where head was or follows.\n\nStandard Snake mechanics.\n\nIn this case, positions list: head first, then body segments.\n\nSo for length 1: positions [(x,y)]\n\nAfter moving to new cell without food: positions [(new_x, new_y)]\n\nAfter moving to new cell with food: positions [(new_x, new_y), (old_x, old_y)] for the next state.\n\nThen when moving again, if no eat, head moves to new position, tail (the last segment) is removed, so positions shift.\n\nIf eat, tail stays, new head added.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAt turn 0, snake at (3,3), head dir L.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, etc., but the answer format is for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. I think I need to output a sequence for the next few turns, but since it's a game, I might not know all future, but I need to plan ahead and decide the immediate action based on that.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but then output the actions from current turn.\n\nIn the context, I think for the response, I need to provide the sequence for the next moves, but since the state might change, I should provide actions for as long as I can reasonably plan.\n\nBut with food life spans, I need to consider.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for the next, say, 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince the snake needs to eat to grow, and there are multiple food, I should head towards one.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\n- Food A: (3,5) value +1, life 10\n\n- Food B: (4,5) value +1, life 10\n\n- Food C: (6,6) value +1, life 10\n\nAll same, so no priority.\n\n(3,5) is directly above (3,3), two steps up: from (3,3) to (3,4) then to (3,5).\n\n(4,5) is one right and two up, but since head is facing left, moving right is opposite, not allowed this turn.\n\nCurrent direction L, so I can't move R this turn.\n\nSo to reach (4,5), I need to go up or down first, then right, but it's at (4,5), which is adjacent in x and y.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (4,5): I can go up to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then up to (4,5), but (4,4) may not have food, but I need to eat at (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is simpler: up to (3,4), then up to (3,5).\n\n(6,6) is farther: (6,6) from (3,3) is +3 in x, +3 in y, so multiple moves.\n\nSince life span 10, I can go for it, but closer food might be better to grow faster.\n\nAlso, with internal wall at (1,6), which is near top-left, but not directly in path yet.\n\nNow, for turn 0, possible actions:\n\n- Move L to (2,3): then I'm at (2,3), direction L. From there, I can go L to (1,3), but (1,3) is not wall, wall at (1,6) which is different. x=1,y=6 is wall, but (1,3) is free. Then from (1,3) I could go to other places, but no food nearby except the existing ones.\n\n- Move U to (3,4): then closer to (3,5) or (4,5).\n\n- Move D to (3,2): away from food, not good.\n\nSo moving down seems bad, as it takes me away from food.\n\nMoving left also away from food, since food is at y=5 or 6, higher y.\n\ny=5 and 6, while I'm at y=3, so up is towards food.\n\n(3,5) is at same x, higher y, so up is directly towards it.\n\n(4,5) is higher x and y.\n\nBut I can't move right now, so to reach (4,5), I need to go up first or something.\n\nBut (3,5) is easier.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to avoid colliding with new body.\n\nSince I start with length 1, after eating one food, I become length 2, then I have a body segment.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,4) now, no eat, then to (3,5) next turn, eat, so at turn 1, if I move to (3,5), I eat, length 2, positions: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3)\n\nAction U: move to (3,4). Since (3,4) has no food, snake is now at [(3,4)], length 1.\n\nTurn 1: I can move from (3,4). Possible to U to (3,5) which has food. So move to (3,5), eat, so now snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (3,5), and body at (3,4) or (3,3)? When I move to (3,4) at turn 0, snake is at (3,4) alone. Then at turn 1, move to (3,5), which has food, so eat, head moves to (3,5), and since it ate, the tail is added, but where? The previous position was (3,4), so now positions are [(3,5), (3,4)] for the next state. So body at (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,5), and I can move from there.\n\nNow, at that point, food at (4,5) and (6,6) still, but (3,5) was eaten, so removed.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), that food is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I go elsewhere.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nI should consider going for (3,5) first since it's close.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), body at (3,4).\n\nThen I need to move. Possible directions: U, D, L, R, but not opposite to current direction. After moving to (3,5), the head direction would be U (since I came from (3,4) to (3,5), so moving up, so direction U.\n\nThen I can move U, L, R, but not D (down).\n\nFrom (3,5), move U to (3,6), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has food, so moving to (4,5) would eat it immediately.\n\nBut (4,5) is adjacent, so if I go to (4,5) from (3,5), that's right, which is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nThen eat, grow to length 3, head at (4,5), body at (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut is that good? I can eat two food quickly.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThere's an internal wall at (1,6), which is near, but not blocking yet.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nAnother option: if I don't go for (3,5) immediately, but (3,5) might be eaten by me or it could expire, but since I'm close, I can get it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is also close.\n\nBut since I can't move right now, I need to go via up.\n\nTurn 0 action: if I move U to (3,4), then turn 1 move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nIf turn 0 I move L to (2,3), then I'm farther, and might not get the food soon.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,2) worse.\n\nSo U seems best for turn 0.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U is safe.\n\n(3,4) is free, no wall, not occupied.\n\nThen to (3,5) is free except it has food, which is good.\n\nAfter that, at turn 1, after eating, head at (3,5), body at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen turn 2, I can move to (4,5) to eat the food there, since (4,5) has food.\n\nMove R to (4,5), eat, grow to length 3, positions: head at (4,5), body at (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nNow head direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\nNow, food left: (6,6) at (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), I need to go to (6,6).\n\nOne way: R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6), but (6,5) may not have food, but I can go to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) is right, then (6,5) to (6,6) is up.\n\nBut (6,5) might be free.\n\nAnother way: from (4,5) go U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), then R to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut let's see the life span: food at (6,6) has life 10, current turn 0, so after a few turns, it might still be there.\n\nAssume turn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5) eat, now snake: head (3,5), body (3,4), length 2, direction U\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5) eat, now snake: head (4,5), body (3,5) and (3,4), length 3, direction R\n\nNow at turn 2, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 3: I can move R to (5,5), or U to (4,6), or D to (4,4)\n\n(5,5) has no food, (4,6) no food, (4,4) no food.\n\nFood at (6,6) only left, I think.\n\nOriginal food: (4,5) eaten now, (3,5) eaten, so only (6,6) left.\n\nSo I need to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), moving R to (5,5) seems direct.\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) then to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) to (6,5) is down, but I can go directly.\n\nBut (6,5) must be free.\n\nFirst, move to (5,5): at turn 3, move R to (5,5), no eat, so snake moves: head to (5,5), body: since no eat, tail moves, so the body was (3,5) and (3,4), tail at (3,4) moves to where the head was? Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: from [head (4,5), body1 (3,5), body2 (3,4)]\n\nAfter move R to (5,5) no eat: head to (5,5), body1 to (4,5) (previous head), body2 to (3,5) (previous body1), and tail (3,4) is removed? Length 3, positions: before move, indices: [0:head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4)]\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no eat: new head (5,5), then body: the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head, but no: the head moves to (5,5), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,5), the second body segment moves to where the first body was, (3,5), and the tail (index 2) was at (3,4), but since no grow, the tail position is left, so snake now at [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (4,5) and (3,5)? (3,5) was body, now it moves to (4,5)? Let's think of the positions list.\n\nBefore move: positions list: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] head first.\n\nMove head to (5,5).\n\nIf no eat, the tail end is removed, so positions become: new head at (5,5), then the rest: the segment that was behind head moves to head's old position, so (3,5) moves to (4,5), and (3,4) moves to (3,5)? No.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo position i moves to position i-1's old position.\n\nFor i from 1 to end.\n\nAfter head moves, position 1 (first body) moves to where head was.\n\nPosition 2 moves to where position 1 was.\n\nEtc.\n\nHere: before move: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,4)\n\nHead moves to (5,5)\n\nThen index 1 (the body segment) moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,5)\n\nThen index 2 moves to where index 1 was, which is (3,5)\n\nAnd since no new segment, the position (3,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at (5,5), I can move to (6,5) or (5,6) or (5,4), etc.\n\nFood at (6,6).\n\nSo to reach (6,6), I can go to (6,5) then to (6,6).\n\nMove R to (6,5) from (5,5).\n\nThen from (6,5) to (6,6) U.\n\nBut at (6,5), no food, then to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nCurrent turn: after turn 2, we have snake at (4,5) etc.\n\nSet the turns.\n\nTurn 0: action U, move to (3,4) no eat, snake now [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: action U, move to (3,5) eat, snake now [(3,5), (3,4)]  length 2\n\nTurn 2: action R, move to (4,5) eat, snake now [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]? After eating at (4,5), head at (4,5), and since ate, the tail is not removed, so body includes the previous tail.\n\nBefore move at turn 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)] head (3,5)\n\nMove to (4,5) which has food, eat.\n\nSo head to (4,5), and new tail added? When eat, the head moves to new cell, and the tail remains, so the body grows.\n\nPositions: new head (4,5), then the previous positions: (3,5) and (3,4) both remain, so [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nYes.\n\nDirection: since moved right, head direction R.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5) no eat, so head to (5,5), body: index 1 moves to (4,5) (where head was), index 2 moves to (3,5) (where index 1 was), and (3,4) is removed, so positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nNow head at (5,5), body at (4,5) and (3,5)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5) no eat, head to (6,5), body: index 1 to (5,5), index 2 to (4,5), positions [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6) which has food, eat, so head to (6,6), body remains: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]? After eating, positions: new head (6,6), and previous positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nNow snake length 4.\n\nAll food eaten by turn 5.\n\nBut turn 5 is t1+5.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0 to 5.\n\nIn the sequence, I need actions from turn t1.\n\nBut at turn 0, I moved U, which is fine.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nFor example, after eating at (3,5) and (4,5), I have body segments.\n\nWhen I move to (6,6), I need to ensure not to collide.\n\nIn this path, (6,6) was free, and I moved directly.\n\nBut there is a wall at (1,6), but I didn't go near it.\n\nAlso, borders: (6,5) and (6,6) are within bounds, x=6<7, y=6<7.\n\ny=7 is top, so y=6 is fine.\n\nNow, but I need to think beyond, but with no food left, I need to survive, but the game might have new food spawning, but the state doesn't say anything about new food, so I think only the given food exist, and after eating all, I can just move around safely.\n\nBut the life span is 10, and I ate them early, so no issue.\n\nBut in this plan, I ate all food by turn 5.\n\nBut is this optimal? I could have gone for (6,6) first or something, but it's farther, so might take more turns, and food might expire, but life 10, from turn 0, I can reach (6,6) in, say, 5 moves or so.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,6): min moves 6 steps if diagonal, but I can only move orthogonally, so |dx| + |dy| = 3+3=6 moves.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I ate (3,5) at turn 1, (4,5) at turn 2, then to (6,6) by turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 I eat (6,6).\n\nTurn 0: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 2: to (4,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: to (6,6) eat\n\nSo ate three food by turn 5.\n\nIf I go directly to (6,6), it would take at least 6 moves, and I might miss the other food.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) move R? But I can't, direction L, so not possible to move right immediately.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,4) no food\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4) no food\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5) no food\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,6) no food\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,6) eat\n\nBut I only ate one food, and missed (3,5) and (4,5), which might expire later, but I could go back, but with shorter path, I can eat all.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat all three efficiently.\n\nBut in the first plan, when I move to (4,5) at turn 2, from (3,5), which is adjacent, and (4,5) is free.\n\nBut what about the internal wall? (1,6) is not in the way.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, after eating, when I have body, I need to avoid moving into body.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, after eating at (4,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen to (5,5), fine.\n\nThen to (6,5), fine.\n\nThen to (6,6), fine.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIf from (4,5) I had moved down or something, but not necessary.\n\nNow, but the food at (3,5) and (4,5) are both at y=5, and I ate them quickly.\n\nBut is there a better sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn 0, I move D to (3,2), but that seems bad, away from food.\n\nOr L to (2,3), then I need to come back.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: from (2,3), direction L, I can move L to (1,3), or U to (2,4), or D to (2,2)\n\nSay move U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 2: to (2,5) or (3,4) or (1,4), etc.\n\nThen to (3,5) or something, but it takes more turns to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) might be reached later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, moving up at turn 0 is best.\n\nBut in the plan, I have actions up to turn 5, but for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nThe answer format should be for multiple turns, starting from t1.\n\nt1=0.\n\nAlso, since I thought 5 turns ahead, I can output turns 0 to 5 actions.\n\nBut turn 5 I moved to (6,6), but after that, no food, so I can stop or something, but I think I need to output the actions for the immediate decisions.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for turns where I need to specify.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and then output actions for the current and next turns based on that plan.\n\nIn this case, for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen for turn 1, action U, and so on.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a clear plan.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the tail reward danger not an issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: but in this case, no food under body initially, and I ate them before.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (3,4) at turn 0, (3,4) might have food? No, food is at (3,5), (4,5), (6,6), so (3,4) is empty.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but what about the internal obstacle? (1,6) is a wall, but I didn't go near it, so fine.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (6,6), I am at (6,6) with body, but I can move away.\n\nBut since no more food, I can just move safely, e.g., down or left, but not into wall.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), but (6,5) is part of body? After turn 5, positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo (6,5) is body, so I cannot move to (6,5), collision.\n\nHead at (6,6), body at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, border, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,6), which is free, I think.\n\nR to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, border.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut in my earlier turn 5 action, I moved to (6,6), which is fine, but after that, at turn 6, I need to move L to (5,6) or something.\n\nBut since no food, it's just for survival.\n\nBut in the context, I think for the answer, I can output the actions up to turn 5 or so.\n\nBut let's see the required output.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence for the next few actions based on the plan.\n\nSince the plan is clear, I can do:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nThen for turn 3, in my plan, I moved R to (5,5)\n\nBut from turn 2 position, after eating at (4,5), head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 3: I can move R to (5,5), as planned.\n\nSimilarly, turn 4: R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: U to (6,6)\n\nNow, after that, turn 6: from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6), no food.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, or I can.\n\nBut the food life span: all food eaten by turn 5, and life span 10, so no issue.\n\nNow, but in the state, there is negative food? No, all food given are value +1, so all positive.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 5, 10, 1) etc., value 1, so positive.\"\n\nNo negative food mentioned.\n\nAlso, special cases not triggered.\n\nSo this seems a good plan.\n\nBut I need to think if there is a risk in the path.\n\nFor example, when I am at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (3,4), and I move to (5,5), fine.\n\nThen to (6,5), fine.\n\nThen to (6,6), fine.\n\nNo walls in between.\n\n(6,6) is not wall.\n\nInternal wall at (1,6), far away.\n\nSo safe.\n\nPerhaps I can consider going for (6,6) first, but it takes longer and I might not get other food.\n\nFor example, if I go directly to (6,6), I might eat it at turn 5 or 6, but (3,5) and (4,5) might expire if I don't eat them, but life span 10, from turn 0, if I reach (6,6) by turn 6, it should be ok, but I miss the opportunity to eat the closer food earlier.\n\nBy eating earlier, I grow longer, but in this game, score is based on eating, and survival, but since no immediate danger, eating sooner is better to score points.\n\nEach food gives +1 score, and increases length, which might help in survival or not, but longer snake is harder to maneuver, but here grid is open, so fine.\n\nIn this case, with length 4, I can still move.\n\nFor example, after turn 5, at (6,6), move to (5,6), then to (5,7) but y=7 wall, so not, or to (4,6), etc., but no food, so just avoid walls and body.\n\nBut I think the plan is solid.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U (up)\n\nTurn 1: U (up) to eat at (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: R (right) to eat at (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: R (right) to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: R (right) to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: U (up) to eat at (6,6)\n\nNow, in terms of directions, I need to specify the action at each turn.\n\nAfter turn 2, when I move R, direction becomes R, so for turn 3, moving R is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI could stop at turn 2 or 3, but since I thought ahead, I can output more.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn t1=0.\n\nNow, about the head direction: at turn 0, head direction is given as L, but after moving, it changes.\n\nBut for the action, I just need to output the move.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen after that, direction is U.\n\nThen turn 1, action U, direction U.\n\nTurn 2, action R, direction R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, but in the output, I should list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for 5+ turns, but after turn 5, no food, so actions might be arbitrary for survival.\n\nBut to be precise, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nSince turn 5 I eat the last food.\n\nNow, another thing: in turn 4, I moved to (6,5), which has no food, but it's a step to (6,6).\n\nCould I go directly? No, because from (6,5) to (6,6) is necessary.\n\nIf from (5,5) I go to (5,6), then to (6,6), but (5,6) might be free.\n\nIn my sequence, from (5,5) at turn 3, I moved to (6,5), but I could move to (5,6) if I want.\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is right, then up to (6,6)? (5,6) to (6,6) is right, directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), then R to (6,6).\n\nBut in that case, at turn 3: from (5,5) move U to (5,6) no eat.\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut turn 4 I eat (6,6), whereas in my sequence I eat at turn 5.\n\nBut I ate (4,5) at turn 2, so same number of food eaten by turn 4? No.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 2: eat (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: eat (6,6)\n\nIf I go via (5,6):\n\nAfter turn 2: at [(4,5),(3,5),(3,4)] head (4,5) dir R\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5)? From (4,5) to (5,5) is R, to (5,6) is U? (4,5) to (5,6) is not adjacent orthogonally; adjacent cells are same x or y differ by 1.\n\n(4,5) to (5,6): dx=1, dy=1, not orthogonal, so invalid move. Must move to adjacent cell, so from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) U, (4,4) D, (5,5) R, (3,5) L.\n\nNot to (5,6) directly.\n\nSo to reach (6,6), I need to go to (5,5) or (6,5) or (5,6) first.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), then R to (6,6).\n\nBut (4,6) may not have food.\n\nIn that case: turn 3: from (4,5) move U to (4,6) no eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (4,6), body: index 1 to (4,5), index 2 to (3,5), positions [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] since no eat, tail (3,4) removed.\n\nBefore: [(4,5),(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nMove head to (4,6), no eat.\n\nThen index 1 moves to (4,5) (where head was), index 2 moves to (3,5) (where index 1 was), and (3,4) removed.\n\nSo positions [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (5,6) no eat? (5,6) has no food, I think.\n\nHead to (5,6), body: index 1 to (4,6), index 2 to (4,5), positions [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 5: move R to (6,6) eat, head to (6,6), body remains: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nAte at turn 5 same as before.\n\nBut I have an extra body segment at (4,5), but same length.\n\nAnd I didn't go to (6,5).\n\nBut in this path, I went to (4,6), which is closer to the internal wall? (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, so (4,6) is different.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nHowever, in terms of efficiency, both paths similar, but in my first path, I went through (6,5), which is fine.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo back to the action sequence.\n\nFor turn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nThen for turn 3, I need to move towards (6,6), so from (4,5), move R to (5,5) or U to (4,6), both possible.\n\nIn my initial plan, I did R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nI could do U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), then R to (6,6), but same number of moves.\n\nPerhaps moving R directly is simpler.\n\nMoreover, (5,5) is central, might be better for future, but no food.\n\nSo I'll stick with the first.\n\nThus actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R  (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 4: R  (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 5: U  (to (6,6) eat)\n\nNow, for the output, I need to box it.\n\nBut the answer format is for the actions.\n\nAlso, in turn 2, I moved R to eat (4,5), which is correct.\n\nNow, but in the state, snake head direction was L at turn 0, but after move, it changes, but I don't need to report direction, only actions.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTo think longer term, but since no more food, I can stop.\n\nSo I'll output actions for turns 0 to 5.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (from turn 0 to turn 5) based on the current state. The strategy prioritizes eating all available positive food efficiently while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's own body. Since the snake starts with length 1, eating food will increase its length, so I must plan paths that avoid future collisions, especially as the snake grows.\n\n### Key Considerations from the Current State:\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Starting at (3,3) with direction L (left). Possible moves are U (up), D (down), or L (left) to avoid instant reverse (R is not allowed).\n- **Food Locations and Life Span**: \n  - (3,5): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 10).\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 10.\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 10.\n  All food is positive and has a long life span (10 turns), so there is no urgency to eat immediately, but eating sooner allows the snake to grow and access more areas safely.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: \n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is not in the immediate path.\n- **Risks to Avoid**:\n  - With length 1, body collisions are impossible initially, but after eating, the snake grows, so movements must avoid future self-intersection.\n  - Tail reward danger is not applicable yet, as there is no tail segment adjacent to the head with food.\n  - Moving toward food efficiently minimizes turns and maximizes score.\n\n### Plan for Turns 0–5:\n1. **Turn 0**: Move U (up) to (3,4). This moves the snake closer to the food at (3,5) and (4,5) without risk. Direction changes to U.\n2. **Turn 1**: Move U (up) to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)]. Direction remains U.\n3. **Turn 2**: Move R (right) to (4,5) to eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]. Direction changes to R.\n4. **Turn 3**: Move R (right) to (5,5). No food here, but this is a safe step toward (6,6). Snake moves without growing: positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (tail at (3,4) is removed). Direction remains R.\n5. **Turn 4**: Move R (right) to (6,5). No food here, but closer to (6,6). Snake moves without growing: positions [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Direction remains R.\n6. **Turn 5**: Move U (up) to (6,6) to eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 4: positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Direction changes to U.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: All three food items are eaten by turn 5, scoring +3 points efficiently. No food is missed or at risk of expiring (life span 10 > turn 5).\n- **Survival Focus**: \n  - The path avoids walls and obstacles entirely. For example:\n    - (1,6) is far from the route.\n    - Border walls (e.g., y=7) are avoided; at (6,6), moving U to (6,7) would hit a wall, but we move U only on turn 5 to eat food, and (6,7) is not targeted.\n  - After eating, body segments are managed: at turn 5, moving to (6,6) is safe as it was unoccupied.\n  - The sequence minimizes sharp turns and keeps the snake in open areas, reducing entanglement risk.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: \n  - Beyond turn 5, no food remains, so the snake should prioritize survival by moving to open cells (e.g., from (6,6), move L to (5,6) to avoid walls/body). But since the plan achieves all food, further moves are not critical for this response.\n- **Efficiency**: The plan takes a direct path to food, minimizing moves (e.g., (3,5) and (4,5) are eaten early, and (6,6) is reached in 5 turns). Alternatives (e.g., going directly to (6,6) first) would take more turns and risk missing closer food.\n\n### Risks Mitigated:\n- **Turn 0**: Moving U avoids moving away from food (D or L would delay eating).\n- **Turn 2**: Moving R to (4,5) is safe as the cell is unoccupied by body (body at (3,5) and (3,4), not adjacent).\n- **Turn 5**: Moving U to (6,6) is safe; no body or walls at (6,6).\n- **Life Span**: All food is eaten well before life span expiration (turn 5 < 10).\n\nThis plan ensures maximum score with minimal risk. Actions for turns 0–5 are below.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 1: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 2: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",

At the start, it might be just the head, but let's see the direction is given as \"U\", up.\n\nAlso, food positions: (4,5,8,1) – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 5, 8, 1) - (3, 5, 8, 1) - (6, 6, 8, 1) - (6, 5, 9, 1)\"\n\nSo each is (x, y, life_span, value). And all values are 1, so all are positive food? Value=1 means positive food, since penalty would be -1. Here all values are 1, so all are positive food. Life spans are 8,8,8,9 respectively.\n\nNow, snake positions: only [(2,4)], so the snake must be of length 1. That means it's just the head, no body segments. So when it eats food, it will grow to length 2.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so moving up.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells are where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6. But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), which is playable but blocked.\n\n(1,6): x=1, y=6. Since y=6 is not a border wall, but it's an obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSimilarly, other cells: (4,5), (3,5), (6,6), (6,5) are food positions.\n\nNow snake at (2,4), heading up.\n\nSince snake is only head, no body to worry about collisions, except walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: since direction is U, I cannot move D on next turn.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 2.\n\nThe output should be actions for turn 2, turn 3, turn 4, etc., but how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but the answer format is to list actions for several turns. It doesn't specify how many, but since it's a sequence, I should plan for at least 5 turns or until a food is eaten or something.\n\nBut the food has life spans, so I need to consider that.\n\nLife spans: for example, (4,5) has life_span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns from now? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nCurrent turn is t1=2, so for food at (4,5), life_span=8, so it will disappear after turn 2+8=10? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, the life_span is given, and it decreases by 1 each turn, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor food at (4,5): life_span=8 at turn 2. So after turn 2, countdown=7; after turn 3, countdown=6; ... after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, life_span is L. Then during turn t, the countdown is L. After the turn, it decreases, so at the start of turn t+1, countdown is L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before that turn or after?\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, the food has remaining life. For example, at turn 2, life_span=8, so it can be eaten on turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? Since after 8 turns from now, it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from current, meaning after N full turns.\n\nLet's assume that the countdown is the number of turns it will still be present, including the current turn.\n\nSo for life_span L at turn t, the food will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears after turn t + L - 1? I need to standardize.\n\nTypically in such games, if life_span is L at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something.\n\nBut to simplify, since the countdown decreases every turn including current, let's say at the start of turn, if countdown >0, food is present, and after the turn, countdown decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (4,5) at turn 2: countdown=8, present on turn 2.\n\nAfter turn 2, countdown=7, present on turn 3.\n\n...\nAfter turn 9, countdown=0, present on turn 9? When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\nThe rule says \"disappears after N turns\", N=life_span.\n\nLet's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, the food will disappear after L turns, meaning it will not be present on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, L=8, it will disappear after 8 turns, so it is present from turn 2 to turn 9? Turn 2 to turn 2+7=9, since after 8 turns from turn 2 is turn 10, so disappears before turn 10.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- After 0 turns from turn 2: still turn 2, present.\n\n- After 1 turn: turn 3, present.\n\n- ...\n\n- After 7 turns: turn 9, present.\n\n- After 8 turns: turn 10, not present.\n\nSo food is present on turns where turn number <= t + L - 1.\n\nAt turn t, food with life_span L is present for turns from t to t+L-1 inclusive.\n\nFor (4,5): at turn 2, L=8, present from turn 2 to 2+7=9, so turns 2 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): L=8, turns 2 to 9.\n\n(6,6): L=8, turns 2 to 9.\n\n(6,5): L=9, present from turn 2 to 2+8=10.\n\nNow, back to the snake. Snake at (2,4), head only, direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4): since direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D (instant reverse).\n\nGrid: from (2,4), moving U would go to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nBut walls: borders, so y=0 and y=7 walls, but (2,5): y=5, which is between 1 and 6, so ok. (2,3): y=3, ok. (1,4): x=1, y=4, is this a wall? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not border, but there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), which is different. (1,4) is not listed as wall, so it should be free.\n\nInternal obstacle only at (1,6), so (1,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) should be free.\n\nNow, moving to (2,3): y=3, not border.\n\nBut let's list possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,5)\n\n- D: to (2,3) but instant reverse, not allowed since current dir U, cannot move D.\n\n- L: to (1,4)\n\n- R: to (3,4)\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting food.\n\nFood positions: (4,5), (3,5), (6,6), (6,5)\n\nAll at different locations.\n\n(3,5) is close, at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,4), moving U to (2,5) would be closer to (3,5), which is at (3,5).\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is adjacent, right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is a bit further.\n\n(6,6) and (6,5) are far.\n\nSince snake is short, I should try to eat food to grow.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so body segments will be there.\n\nCurrently, no body, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n\nObstacle at (1,6), which is not near for now.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, turn 2: I need to choose action.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), then I am at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5) to eat the food at (3,5), which is positive, value 1.\n\n(3,5) has food, life_span 8, so present.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 2, then on turn 3, I can move R to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows. Currently, snake is only head at (2,4). After moving to (2,5), the head is at (2,5), and since no body, the tail was at (2,4), but since no growth, tail moves away? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves with the head.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position, so tail moves away from its position.\n\nBut here, since only one segment, when it moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically for this case: at turn 2, snake positions: [(2,4)] , so head at (2,4).\n\nAfter moving, say to (2,5), new head position (2,5), and since no food eaten, the tail (which was the only segment) is removed, so new snake is [(2,5)].\n\nSimilarly, if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows to two segments.\n\nFor example, if at turn 3, I move to (3,5) and eat the food there, then new head at (3,5), and the previous position (2,5) becomes body, so snake becomes [(3,5), (2,5)].\n\nThen direction would be R, since moved right.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 2.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move U to (2,5)\n\n- Move L to (1,4)\n\n- Move R to (3,4)\n\nNow, (1,4) is near the left wall, x=1, but not wall, and obstacle at (1,6) is above, but not immediate issue.\n\n(3,4) is closer to the food at (3,5), which is above.\n\n(2,5) is also close to (3,5).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), then from there I can go to (3,5) to eat, but on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,5), to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nBut from (2,4) to (3,4) is right, then to (3,5) is up.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5) is up, then to (3,5) is right.\n\nBoth take two moves to reach (3,5), but moving U first puts me at (2,5), which is adjacent to (3,5), so on next turn I can eat directly.\n\nMoving R to (3,4) also adjacent to (3,5), so similarly.\n\nBut (3,4) to (3,5) is up, which might be same direction or not.\n\nCurrent direction U, if I move R to (3,4), new direction R.\n\nThen from (3,4), moving U to (3,5) is not reverse, since reverse would be D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (2,5), new direction U, then moving R to (3,5) is right, not reverse.\n\nBoth fine.\n\nNow, other foods: (4,5) is at (4,5), which is east of (3,5).\n\n(6,6) and (6,5) are south-east.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have at least 8 turns, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (6,5) has life_span 9, one more turn.\n\nBut since snake is short, I can go for the closest food first.\n\n(3,5) is very close, only one move away if I go to adjacent cell.\n\nFrom current (2,4), (3,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,5), (1,4), (3,4), (2,3) but (2,3) is down, not allowed.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is diagonally adjacent but not orthogonally, so I need to move to an adjacent cell first, then to (3,5).\n\nFor example, to reach (3,5), I need to be at (3,4), (2,5), (4,5), or (3,6), but (3,6) might be out of bound? y=6, border is y=7 wall, so y=6 is playable.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\nBut (3,6) is free, I think.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nSo from (2,4), moving to (3,4) or (2,5) both get me adjacent to (3,5).\n\n(3,4) is directly below (3,5), (2,5) is directly left of (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is not adjacent to any food directly.\n\nSo moving L to (1,4) might not be efficient for getting food soon.\n\nMoving R to (3,4) or U to (2,5) are better for reaching (3,5) quickly.\n\nNow, after eating (3,5), snake grows to length 2, head at (3,5), tail at (2,5) or wherever previous was.\n\nSuppose on turn 2, I move U to (2,5). Then snake at [(2,5)], direction U.\n\nTurn 3: I move R to (3,5). Now, (3,5) has food, so I eat it. Since I moved to food, I grow. New head at (3,5), and the previous position (2,5) becomes body, so snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5)], direction R.\n\nNow, I have a body segment at (2,5).\n\nNext, I can move to other foods.\n\nAvailable foods: (4,5), (6,6), (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is adjacent to (3,5), to the right.\n\n(3,5) to (4,5) is east, R.\n\nBut current direction is R, so moving R is fine.\n\nI could move up to (3,6), or down to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free.\n\n(3,4) has no food, I think.\n\nFood at (4,5), (6,6), (6,5).\n\n(4,5) is close.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5) on turn 4, I eat it, grow to length 3, head at (4,5), body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nThen snake: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other foods.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), which is east, but x=6, border? x=7 wall, so x=6 is playable.\n\n(6,5) to (4,5) is two steps east, but (5,5) in between.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is north-east.\n\nBut life spans are long, so I can go.\n\nBut there might be risks with the body.\n\nCurrently, after eating (3,5) and (4,5), the snake has segments at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n\nThen if I go east to (5,5), then to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) has food, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is above.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail and possible collisions.\n\nFirst, let's consider if I don't go directly to (3,5).\n\nAnother option: from (2,4), I could move R to (3,4).\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4), snake at [(3,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,5), eat food at (3,5), grow, snake: head (3,5), body (3,4), so positions [(3,5), (3,4)], direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,5) by R, for example.\n\nMove R to (4,5) on turn 4, eat, grow to length 3, head (4,5), body (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nNow, body at (3,5) and (3,4), which are vertical.\n\nThen go to (6,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so from (4,5), move R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), eat on turn 6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut both paths seem similar.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,6) and (6,5).\n\n(6,6) has life_span 8, (6,5) has 9, so (6,5) lasts longer.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, no food under tail or body, I think.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here, the foods are at different positions, not under snake.\n\nSnake is at (2,4) now, no body, so no issue.\n\nAfter growing, if food is under body, but it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n\nBut for now, no such thing.\n\nI should consider the grid and possible dead ends.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (1,6), which might block the top-left area.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,4), it might be harder to get out or to food.\n\n(1,4) to (1,5) or (1,3), but y=3 or y=5.\n\nThen to (1,6) is obstacle, so cannot go up to y=6 from (1,5)? (1,5) to (1,6) would be up, but (1,6) is obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) to (2,5) or (1,4), etc.\n\nBut food is at (3,5), (4,5), etc., so (1,4) is not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (2,3) is not allowed because instant reverse.\n\nSo best to go towards the food cluster at (3,5) and (4,5).\n\n(3,5) and (4,5) are both at y=5, x=3 and x=4.\n\n(6,5) and (6,6) at x=6.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all foods if possible, but need to avoid dying.\n\nSince life spans are long, I can eat (3,5) and (4,5) first, then go to (6,5) and (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) might be eaten last.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nFrom (2,4), move U to (2,5) on turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, move R to (3,5), eat, grow to [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 4, I can move R to (4,5), eat, grow to [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow at (4,5), with body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nAvailable moves: from (4,5), direction R, so I can move U, D, R, but not L (reverse).\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\nNow, foods at (6,6) and (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), which is south-east? (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6) or directly if possible, but not adjacent.\n\n(4,5) to (6,6) not directly.\n\nTo go to (6,5), I can move R to (5,5) on turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6, move R to (6,5), but (6,5) has food, so eat it.\n\nBut when I move to (6,5), I eat, grow, so new head at (6,5), body segments: previous head at (5,5)? Let's see positions.\n\nBefore turn 5: snake at [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5). Since no food at (5,5), I don't eat, so head moves to (5,5), tail (2,5) moves away? Movement: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n\nSo from positions: head (4,5) to (5,5), body (3,5) moves to (4,5), body (2,5) moves to (3,5). Since no growth, tail is removed, so new positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? Let's list:\n\nPrevious: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,5): new head at (5,5), segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,5), and tail (2,5) is removed since no growth. So new snake: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)].\n\nBut (3,5) was body, now it's the tail.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 6: move to (6,5). (6,5) has food, so I eat it. Head moves to (6,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new segment added. Previous positions: head was (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5).\n\nAfter move: new head at (6,5), body at (5,5) (previous head), body at (4,5) (previous body), and tail stays at (3,5)? No.\n\nStandard: when eating, head moves to new position, all body segments move, but tail stays, so length increases.\n\nSo positions before move: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) and eating: new head at (6,5), the previous head (5,5) becomes new body, previous body (4,5) becomes next body, and tail (3,5) remains tail, but since eating, a new segment is added at the tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nTypically, the snake moves: head to new cell, each segment shifts to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nWhen not eating, the tail position is vacated.\n\nWhen eating, the tail position is not vacated; it stays, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to new cell N:\n\n- If not eat: new positions [N, H, B1, ..., B_last], and T removed, so length same.\n\n- If eat: new positions [N, H, B1, ..., T], and since T stays, length increases by one.\n\nIn the eat case, the tail does not move, so positions become [N, H, B1, ..., T] with T still there.\n\nFor example, from [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] , move to (6,5) and eat.\n\nNew head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, previous body (4,5) becomes next body, and tail (3,5) remains, so new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 4.\n\nYes.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nAfter turn 4, snake at [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] after eating (4,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 5: move to (5,5), no food, so snake moves to [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] , tail (2,5) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: move to (6,5), eat food, grow to [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, food left: (6,6) at (6,6), which is above (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) to eat it.\n\nBut current direction R, moving U is not reverse, so ok.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6), eat, grow to [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow all foods eaten, snake length 5.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nThe food at (6,6) had life_span 8, present until turn 9, so on turn 7 it's still there.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut what about the tail reward danger? At some point, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, when I eat (6,6), the tail is at (3,5), not adjacent to (6,6), so no issue.\n\nAlso, no food under body segments.\n\nBut in this path, I ate all foods quickly.\n\nBut let's see the life spans.\n\n(3,5) eaten on turn 3, (4,5) on turn 4, (6,5) on turn 6, (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nAll within life spans.\n\nBut is this the best? I could have eaten (6,6) earlier or something.\n\nAnother thing: the obstacle at (1,6), but in this path, I didn't go near it, so no problem.\n\nBut let's think if there is a risk.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) and (4,5), the snake is horizontal at y=5, from x=2 to x=4 or something.\n\nIn my first path, after turn 4, positions (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), all at y=5.\n\nThen moving to (5,5), (6,5), fine.\n\nMoving to (6,6) from (6,5).\n\nBut (6,6) is above, and I move up.\n\nNow, the grid has walls, but I didn't hit them.\n\nBut I need to think long-term survival. After eating all food, I need to not die, but since no more food, I just need to move without colliding.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating all positive food is good.\n\nBut are there negative foods? In this state, all foods are positive, value 1, no negative mentioned.\n\nSo eating all is good.\n\nBut perhaps I can plan to eat in a different order to have more space.\n\nFor example, (6,6) and (6,5) are close, I ate them last.\n\nBut I ate (3,5) and (4,5) first, which are also close.\n\nAnother point: from the start, if I move directly to (6,5) or something, but it's farther, and life span is long, but I might miss closer food if not eaten soon, but since life span 8, I have time.\n\nBut eating sooner is better to grow, so I can reach farther foods faster with longer body? Not necessarily, movement is one cell per turn.\n\nWith longer body, I might have more collision risk, but in open space, fine.\n\nIn this case, grid is small, 6x6 playable, with obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) obstacle.\n\nSo total cells: 6x6=36, minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake can occupy up to 35, but with foods disappearing, but here all eaten.\n\nIn my plan, I eat all 4 foods, score 4, length 5.\n\nThen I can survive, but no more food, so score won't increase.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should list actions starting from turn 2.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5) eat\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5) no eat\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nThen after that, I need to move around to survive.\n\nBut since no more food, I just need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), but (6,5) is body? After turn 7, positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nSo (6,5) is body, cannot move there.\n\nAvailable moves from (6,6): direction U (since last move up).\n\nCan move U, but y=7 is wall, so cannot move up to (6,7).\n\nCan move D to (6,5), but occupied by body.\n\nCan move L to (5,6), or R, but x=7 wall, cannot move right to (7,6).\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions for several turns, probably until I eat or something.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince t1=2, I should list for turn 2,3,4,5,6 at least.\n\nIn my sequence, by turn 7 I eat last food.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better way.\n\nAnother option: I could eat (6,5) first or something, but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), if I move R to (3,4), then U to (3,5) same as before.\n\nOr directly to (4,5), but not adjacent.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nWhat about the food at (6,6)? From (2,4) to (6,6) is far.\n\nFor example, move R multiple times, but need to go up.\n\nBut (3,5) is on the way.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is at bottom, but y=5.\n\nAnother thing: the obstacle at (1,6) might trap me if I go left.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (1,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen at (1,4), direction L.\n\nThen I can move U to (1,5) or D to (1,3) or L, but x=0 wall, cannot, or R to (2,4), but (2,4) was previous, might be ok, but not food.\n\n(1,5) is free, move U to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move to (2,5) or (1,4), but (1,6) is obstacle, cannot move up.\n\nSo move to (2,5).\n\nThen to (3,5), etc., but it takes more turns to reach food, so I eat later, and might miss if life span short, but here long.\n\nBut I eat the same foods, just later, so score same, but perhaps riskier if something.\n\nIn terms of score, since all positive, eating all gives same score.\n\nBut with longer path, I might have more turns, but score is based on food eaten, not turns survived, I think.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating food, so eating all is best.\n\nIn this case, with 4 foods, max score 4.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn my first sequence, I have actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 6: R (to (6,5))\n\nBut on turn 6, I eat (6,5), and I need to go to (6,6) next.\n\nBut (6,6) is above, so on turn 7, move U.\n\nBut for the answer, I should list actions for 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if moving U first is better or R first.\n\nFrom (2,4), moving U to (2,5) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I move R to (3,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 4, move R to (4,5) eat.\n\nSame as before, but on turn 2 I moved to (3,4) instead of (2,5).\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn the first case, when I moved U to (2,5), then to (3,5), the body is at (2,5), which is left.\n\nWhen I move R to (3,4) then U to (3,5), body is at (3,4), which is below.\n\nThen when I go to (4,5), body at (3,5) and (3,4), vertical.\n\nThen moving to (5,5), etc.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut in the first case, after eating (3,5) with body at (2,5), when I go to (4,5), the tail is at (2,5), which is farther.\n\nIn terms of space, it might be similar.\n\nAnother food: (6,6) is at (6,6), which I can eat by going up from (6,5).\n\nBut I could eat (6,6) before (6,5) if I go there.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), instead of going directly east, I could go north to (4,6), then to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) might be free.\n\nFrom (4,5), after eating (4,5), at turn 4, positions [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nI can move U to (4,6) on turn 5.\n\nThen at (4,6), no food, snake moves to [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] , tail (2,5) removed.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6), or U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, cannot, or D to (4,5) but occupied, or L to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is free? No obstacle, but (1,6) obstacle, (3,6) should be free.\n\ny=6, x=3.\n\nThen to (6,6), I need to go to (5,6) then (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is below.\n\nBut life span of (6,5) is 9, longer than (6,6) which is 8, so (6,6) disappears earlier if not eaten.\n\n(6,6) life_span 8, present until turn 9.\n\n(6,5) life_span 9, until turn 10.\n\nIn my sequence, I eat both by turn 7, so fine.\n\nBut if I go to (6,6) first, I might eat it earlier.\n\nFor example, from start, directly to (6,6).\n\nBut from (2,4), to (6,6), need to go right and up.\n\ne.g., move R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then R to (5,4), then R to (6,4), then U to (6,5), then U to (6,6), but (6,5) has food, so I might eat it on the way.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and I miss the closer foods (3,5) and (4,5), which might disappear if not eaten, but life span 8, so by turn 10, but if I go directly to (6,6), I eat on turn, say, turn 7 or so, but (3,5) might still be there, but I can go back, but inefficient.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) move R to (3,4) turn 2\n\nTurn 3 move R to (4,4) no food\n\nTurn 4 move R to (5,4) no\n\nTurn 5 move R to (6,4) no\n\nTurn 6 move U to (6,5) eat? (6,5) has food, so eat on turn 6.\n\nThen turn 7 move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut I didn't eat (3,5) and (4,5), which are still there, but I need to go back to eat them.\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move left, but (3,5) is at (3,5), so I need to go to (5,5), (4,5), etc., but (4,5) has food, so I can eat on the way.\n\nBut with body, it might be messy.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,5) and (6,6), snake at [(6,6), (6,5), (5,4)? Let's not.\n\nIt takes more turns and might have collision risk.\n\nBetter to eat closer foods first.\n\nSo back to original plan.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for turn 2, I need to choose.\n\nSince moving U or R both lead to similar, but let's see the direction.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,5) is at (3,5), which is adjacent to both (2,5) and (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is below, (2,5) is left.\n\nNow, after eating, if body at (2,5), it might be near the wall, but x=2, y=5, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is fine.\n\nBut another point: the obstacle at (1,6) might affect if I go left.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (1,4), then I might be near (1,6) obstacle.\n\nBut in moving U or R, I avoid that.\n\nSo probably better to move U or R.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should list actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince I think 5+ turns ahead, I can list actions until I eat the first food or something.\n\nBut the format is to list for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nLet me define the sequence.\n\nAssume I move U on turn 2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nThen turn 3: R to eat (3,5)\n\nThen turn 4: R to eat (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5: R to (5,5) no eat\n\nThen turn 6: R to (6,5) eat\n\nBut I need to go to (6,6) as well.\n\nTurn 7: U to (6,6) eat\n\nBut for the output, I should list from turn 2 to, say, turn 6 or 7.\n\nSince the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", listing 5 actions might be enough, but I can list more.\n\nThe answer format doesn't specify how many, but to demonstrate the plan.\n\nIn the state, snake is alone, no immediate danger.\n\nAnother thing: special case, food can spawn under body, but here no body, so not applicable.\n\nTail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nSo I think my sequence is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nCells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6), but (1,6) obstacle, so (1,6) not playable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) to (2,6), etc.\n\nIn my path, I didn't go to x=1 or y=6 except possibly.\n\ny=6 is playable, except (1,6) blocked.\n\nFor example, (2,6), (3,6), etc. are free.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am at (4,5), I could move to (4,6), but I didn't.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to output.\n\nPerhaps I can start.\n\nSo for turn 2: U\n\nThen turn 3: R\n\nThen turn 4: R\n\nThen turn 5: R (to (5,5))\n\nThen turn 6: R (to (6,5))\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I should include up to eating (6,6).\n\nBut let's see the life spans: all present until at least turn 9, so by turn 7 I eat all.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, list actions for turns 2 to 6.\n\nBut on turn 6 I eat (6,5), and (6,6) still there.\n\nTo be complete.\n\nSince the snake head direction changes, I need to keep track.\n\nIn the output, each action is given.\n\nNow, another point: in the initial move, if I move R to (3,4) on turn 2, then turn 3 U to (3,5), same as moving U then R, but the intermediate position is different.\n\nIn terms of the path, it might affect later if there are constraints, but here no.\n\nBut let's see the body position.\n\nIn move U then R: after eating (3,5), body at (2,5)\n\nIn move R then U: after eating (3,5), body at (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is at y=4, which might be closer to other areas, but not significant.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI'll go with moving U first.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R  (eat (3,5))\n\nTurn 4: R  (eat (4,5))\n\nTurn 5: R  (to (5,5), no eat)\n\nNow, for turn 6, I move R to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list.\n\nPerhaps list up to turn 6.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, from turn 2 to turn 6 is 5 actions: turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 6 is 5 turns? Turn 2,3,4,5,6: that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nI can include turn 7.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn turn 5, I am at (5,5), then turn 6 R to (6,5) eat.\n\nThen for turn 7, I move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSo I can list up to turn 7.\n\nBut the answer format might expect a sequence.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nBut first, confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4) U to (2,5) - valid, not wall, not reverse.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5) R to (3,5) - (3,5) has food, eat, grow.\n\nDirection was U, moving R not reverse.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) R to (4,5) - eat, grow. Direction R, moving R is same, not reverse.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5) R to (5,5) - no food, move. Direction R, moving R fine.\n\n(5,5) should be free, no wall.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5) R to (6,5) - eat, grow. Direction R, moving R fine.\n\nThen turn 7: from (6,5) U to (6,6) - eat, grow. Direction R, moving U not reverse.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 2: U Turn 3: R Turn 4: R Turn 5: R Turn 6: R Turn 7: U }\n\nBut on turn 6, I moved to (6,5), which is R, and turn 7 to (6,6) U.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 6 is R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nYes.\n\nTo save, I could stop at turn 6, but turn 7 is part of the plan.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I include.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of actions 5+ turns ahead, considering the food life spans, movement constraints, and collision risks. The grid is 6x6 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6) with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (1,6). All food is positive (value +1) and will disappear after their life spans: (4,5) and (3,5) after turn 9, (6,6) after turn 9, and (6,5) after turn 10. The snake starts at (2,4) with no body segments, so eating food will grow the snake. I prioritize eating the closest food first to grow quickly and reduce the risk of missing food due to life spans, while avoiding areas near the obstacle at (1,6) that could lead to dead ends.\n\n### Key Risks and Mitigation\n- **Instant reverse constraint**: Current direction is \"U\" (up), so I cannot move \"D\" (down) on the next turn.\n- **Collision risks**: With no body initially, only walls and the obstacle pose risks. After growing, I ensure the snake does not collide with itself by planning open paths.\n- **Food under body**: Not applicable initially, as no body exists. After growth, I avoid moving to cells where food might be under the body unless the body moves away first—but in this plan, all food is in open cells.\n- **Tail reward danger**: I ensure that when eating food, the head is not adjacent to the tail with food, but this is not a risk here as food is not under the tail.\n- **Life spans**: All food has sufficient life (8 or 9 turns), so the plan eats all by turn 7, well within their windows.\n\n### Plan Summary\n- **Turn 2**: Move \"U\" to (2,5) to position for eating (3,5). This avoids the left side near the obstacle and sets up a direct path to food.\n- **Turn 3**: Move \"R\" to (3,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 2: head at (3,5), tail at (2,5).\n- **Turn 4**: Move \"R\" to (4,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 3: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5).\n- **Turn 5**: Move \"R\" to (5,5) (no food). Snake moves to head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). This progresses toward (6,5) without risk.\n- **Turn 6**: Move \"R\" to (6,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 4: head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (4,5), tail at (3,5).\n- **Turn 7**: Move \"U\" to (6,6) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 5: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail at (3,5). All food is eaten by turn 7, maximizing the score to 4.\n\nThis sequence ensures all food is eaten efficiently by turn 7, with no collision risks. After turn 7, the snake can move safely (e.g., left to (5,6)) to survive, but since no more food exists, the score is maximized.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: R \\\\\nTurn 7: U\n}",

Similarly:\n\n- (4,5): disappears after turn 10\n\n- (6,6): disappears after turn 10 (4 + 6)\n\n- (6,5): disappears after turn 11 (4 + 7)\n\n- (2,2): disappears after turn 14 (4 + 10)\n\nBut life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 4, life span is as given. After turn 4, it becomes life span - 1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears.\n\nThe food can be eaten only if the head moves onto it when it's present. Also, special case: if food is under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves in.\n\nIn this case, let's see where food is relative to snake.\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body (2,5). So the snake is horizontal, from (2,5) to (3,5), head at right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,5) is directly to the right of head, at (4,5). Since head is at (3,5), moving right would go to (4,5).\n\n- (6,6) is northeast, at (6,6)\n\n- (6,5) is east, at (6,5)\n\n- (2,2) is southwest, at (2,2)\n\nNow, walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so playable area x=1 to x=6? Similarly y=1 to y=6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut (1,6) is internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSo available cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except (1,6).\n\nNow snake head at (3,5), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R (right), so cannot move L (left) on next turn. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see immediate options.\n\nIf I move right (R) to (4,5), there is food there. (4,5) has food with value 1, life span 6.\n\nIf I eat it, snake grows to length 3, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to consider if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating, snake positions: new head at (4,5), body: (3,5) becomes body, and (2,5) is tail. Since I ate, length increases, so after move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) now body, and (2,5) tail. But when I move to a food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it stays there, and tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head position. So after eating, positions: (4,5) head, (3,5), (2,5) — three segments.\n\nThen next turn, tail moves, etc.\n\nNow, is there any danger? (4,5) is empty now, I think, since food is there but I'm eating it.\n\nThe food is at (4,5), and I'm moving to it, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let's check for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,5), head at (3,5), so they are adjacent, but the food is at (4,5), not on tail. Tail is at (2,5), no food there. Food is at (4,5), which is where head is moving to.\n\nSo no issue with tail reward danger here.\n\nAlso, no collision, since (4,5) is not wall or body.\n\nWalls: (4,5) is within 1-6 x and y, and not (1,6), so fine.\n\nSo moving R to eat (4,5) seems good immediate reward.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere are other foods: (6,6), (6,5), (2,2).\n\n(6,5) is also on row y=5, x=6.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (1,6), which might affect paths.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, let's simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (4,5), eat food, snake becomes: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5). Length 3.\n\nNow, direction: I moved R, so new head direction is R.\n\nPossible moves from there: U (up to (4,6)), D (down to (4,4)), R (right to (5,5)), cannot L (left to (3,5) but that's body, so invalid anyway).\n\n(3,5) is body, so moving left would collide, so only U, D, R possible, but R to (5,5) is empty? Let's see grid.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,5), (2,2).\n\n(5,5) is empty, I think.\n\ny=5, x=5.\n\nAlso, (4,6) is above, (4,4) below.\n\nNow, from (4,5), if I move R to (5,5), then head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5)? After moving to (4,5) and eating, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5).\n\nWhen I move from (4,5) to (5,5), say R, then new head (5,5), body: (4,5) and (3,5), tail (2,5) moves to (3,5)? Standard: when no food eaten, tail moves forward.\n\nBut when I move to (5,5), there is no food there, so tail moves: so positions become: head (5,5), body (4,5) and (3,5), tail was (2,5) but it moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (3,5), but (3,5) is now part of body.\n\nSequence:\n\nStart: positions [ (2,5) tail, (3,5) body, (4,5) head ] after eating at (4,5).\n\nNow, move head to (5,5) - no food, so tail moves: new positions: head at (5,5), body at (4,5) and (3,5)? The segment that was tail (2,5) is removed, and head moves to (5,5), so body segments remain but shift: the body segment at (3,5) becomes the new tail? Let's index.\n\nAfter eating at turn 4: snake positions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: body (3,5), index 2: tail (2,5)\n\nOn next move, say turn 5, move to (5,5), which has no food, so head moves to (5,5), and tail is removed, so positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), and (3,5) is still there? No.\n\nWhen tail moves, the last segment is removed, so if moving to empty cell, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo from [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] move head to (5,5), then body segment 1 moves to where head was (4,5), body segment 2 (tail) moves to where body segment 1 was (3,5). So new positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). The (2,5) is vacated.\n\nSo length remains 3, no growth.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nAt turn 4, head at (3,5), moving R to (4,5) eats food, score +1, snake length 3, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5).\n\nNow turn 5: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision, so invalid. So U, D, R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), head at (5,5), no food there, so positions become head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5).\n\nThen turn 6: from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision? (4,5) is the body segment directly behind, but when I move, the body will move, so moving left to (4,5) might be possible if the body moves away.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail if it's moving away, but in general, you can move into a cell that will be vacated by the tail.\n\nSpecifically, it says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut (4,5) is not tail; tail is at (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move L to (4,5), (4,5) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail; it's the segment behind head.\n\nIn this case, (4,5) is the immediate body segment, which will move to (5,5) when I move, but at the time of move, head is moving to (4,5), which is currently occupied, so it would collide.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo only the tail cell can be moved into, not other body cells.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,5) from (5,5) would collide with body, since (4,5) is not tail; tail is at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,5) from (4,5) to (5,5) is fine since (5,5) was empty.\n\nBut from (5,5), moving L to (4,5) is invalid because (4,5) is body.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,6), (5,4), (6,5) but (6,5) is not adjacent, adjacent are U (5,6), D (5,4), L (4,5), R (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is to the right.\n\n(5,5) to R is (6,5).\n\nNow (6,5) has food with life span 7, so it will be there for a few turns.\n\nLife span at turn 4: 7, so at turn 5, life span 6, turn 6:5, etc., until turn 10 it disappears? Turn 4: life 7, after turn 4: life 6, after turn 5: life 5, ..., after turn 10: life 0, disappear at start of turn 11 or after turn 10?\n\nThe life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N means it will be there for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after N turns, so on turn t+N, it is gone.\n\nAt turn 4, life span 7 for (6,5), so it will be there until turn 10 (4+6? 4+7-1=10? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after k turns, life span is N-k. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So it is present as long as life span >0.\n\nAt turn t, with life span L, after the turn, life span becomes L-1. So if L=1, after the turn it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nThe food can be eaten during the turn if head moves to it when life span >0.\n\nFor (6,5) at turn 4: life span 7, so it will be present on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (since on turn 10, life span 7-6=1? Let's index turns.\n\nTurn 4: life span 7, present.\n\nAfter turn 4: life span 6, still present.\n\nAfter turn 5: life span 5, present.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 10: life span 7-7=0, so after turn 10, it disappears, so not present on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 10 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 4, I can move to (4,5) and eat food immediately.\n\nThen from there, I need to plan next moves.\n\nThere is also food at (6,5) which is close, and (6,6), and (2,2) far.\n\n(2,2) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut the snake is short, only length 2, so eating food is good to grow and have more space.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother option at turn 4: instead of moving R, I could move U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), what is there? (3,6) is within bounds? y=6 is not wall, y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, so y=6 is playable.\n\n(3,6) has no food, I think. Food is at (4,5), (6,6), (6,5), (2,2), so (3,6) empty.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,4) empty.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then head at (3,6), body at (3,5)? Positions: after move, head to (3,6), tail was (2,5) moves to (3,5)? Since no food eaten.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,5), body (2,5) — only two segments.\n\nMove U to (3,6): head moves to (3,6), and tail moves to where head was, (3,5). But (3,5) was head, now body, and tail was (2,5), but since only two segments, after move: head (3,6), tail (3,5). The (2,5) is vacated.\n\nSo positions: [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen I can go to other places.\n\nBut (3,6) is close to (1,6) obstacle, but (1,6) is blocked, so from (3,6), I can move U, but y=6 is top, so U would be to y=7, which is wall, so cannot move U from (3,6) because y=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) are possible.\n\nBut (1,6) is obstacle, so (2,6) is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) playable.\n\nNo food at (3,6), so no reward.\n\nThen I might go towards (6,6) or something.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,4), then head at (3,4), tail at (3,5), positions [(3,4), (3,5)].\n\nThen I can move to (4,4) or (3,3) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut again, no immediate food.\n\nWhereas moving R to (4,5) gives immediate +1.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating is good, and (4,5) is very close.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for future.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,5), head at (3,5), adjacent.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), head at (4,5), tail at (2,5), not adjacent anymore.\n\nThen from there, if I go to (5,5), head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5), etc.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) is at (6,5), which is east.\n\nIf I go directly to (6,5), I can eat it in a few turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can get multiple foods.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) might be harder to reach.\n\nLet's consider a plan to get (4,5) and then (6,5).\n\nAt turn 4: move R to (4,5), eat food, score +1, snake: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), no food, so move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\n(5,5) empty.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5), move R to (6,5), which has food, life span at turn 6: original life 7 at turn 4, turn 5:6, turn 6:5, so present, eat it, score +1, snake grows to length 4.\n\nAfter move to (6,5), eat, so head at (6,5), body: (5,5) and (4,5), tail (3,5) doesn't move, so positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nLength 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut (6,6) is above, at (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move U to (6,6), which has food.\n\nLife span of (6,6): at turn 4:6, turn 5:5, turn 6:4, so present.\n\nIf I move U on turn 7 to (6,6), eat it.\n\nBut let's sequence turns.\n\nAfter turn 6: head at (6,5), after eating (6,5).\n\nTurn 7: from (6,5), move U to (6,6), eat food there, score +1, snake grows to length 5.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision; L to (5,6), R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is empty, I assume.\n\nSo move to (5,6), no food, so tail moves: positions become head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5) — (4,5) is tail? Positions: after eating at (6,6), head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move turn 7: positions [ (3,5) tail, (4,5) body, (5,5) body, (6,5) body, (6,6) head? No.\n\nAfter turn 6: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nMove to (6,6) on turn 7: eat food, so head to (6,6), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5) stays, so positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6), no food there, so head to (5,6), and tail moves: tail (3,5) removed, body segments shift: (6,5) to where head was? New head (5,6), then body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? Standard: each segment moves to previous position.\n\nFrom positions: head (6,6), body segments: seg1 at (6,5), seg2 at (5,5), seg3 at (4,5), tail at (3,5)\n\nMove head to (5,6), no food, so tail (3,5) removed, seg3 (4,5) moves to where tail was? No.\n\nThe body segments: seg1 (6,5) moves to where head was (6,6)? But head was at (6,6), moving to (5,6).\n\nSo new head position: (5,6)\n\nThen seg1 moves to previous head position (6,6)\n\nSeg2 moves to previous seg1 position (6,5)\n\nSeg3 moves to previous seg2 position (5,5)\n\nAnd tail was (3,5), removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, (5,5) is tail, (6,5) is body, etc.\n\nThen I can go to other places.\n\nBut we have food at (2,2), which is far.\n\nNow, back to turn 4, I could consider not eating (4,5) immediately to go for other foods, but (4,5) is easy to get, and I can still get others.\n\nBut (4,5) has life span 6, so it will be there for a while, but if I don't eat it now, I might not get it later, but since it's on the way, I should eat it.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this sequence, after eating (4,5), tail is at (2,5), head at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen when I move to (5,5), tail at (3,5), head at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen to (6,5), head at (6,5), tail at (3,5), far.\n\nThen to (6,6), head at (6,6), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen to (5,6), head at (5,6), tail at (5,5), which is adjacent? (5,5) and (5,6) are adjacent vertically.\n\nTail at (5,5), head at (5,6), so they are adjacent.\n\nIs there food on tail? Tail at (5,5), but (5,5) has no food; food was at (4,5), (6,5), etc., but (5,5) empty, so no problem.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nNow, I also have food at (2,2) with long life.\n\nAfter getting (6,6), I need to go south or west to get to (2,2).\n\nBut the snake is longer, might be harder to maneuver.\n\nAt turn 4, I could go directly to (2,2), but it's far, and (4,5) might disappear if I don't eat it soon.\n\n(4,5) life span 6, from turn 4, so it lasts until turn 10, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut eating (4,5) now gives immediate growth, which might help in reaching other foods without dying.\n\nAnother option: at turn 4, instead of moving R, I could move U to (3,6).\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nThen I can go to (4,6) or (2,6), etc.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (3,6), I can go right to (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) to eat (6,6).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,6), no food, positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), possible moves: D to (3,5) but (3,5) is tail, and it will move? Move to tail cell.\n\n(3,5) is tail, so I can move to it because tail will move away.\n\nIf I move D to (3,5), head to (3,5), which is current tail, and tail will move to where? After move, since no food, tail moves to previous position.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5), which is current tail position. Since it's tail, and tail will move, but where? When head moves to (3,5), which was tail, and no food eaten, so tail should move to the previous position, but it's occupied now? Conflict.\n\nStandard rule: if head moves to tail cell, it is allowed because the tail moves away simultaneously. So no collision.\n\nThen new positions: head at (3,5), and tail was at (3,5), but moves to where it was going to, but since it was tail, and no segment before, it moves to the previous position of the segment before it, but in this case, only two segments.\n\nBefore move: positions A: head (3,6), B: tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5), which is B's position. Since no food, head moves to (3,5), and tail B is removed, but since head is moving to that cell, it's fine, and the new tail is the segment that was head, which moves to where? After move, the new head is at (3,5), and the body is... since only two segments, after head moves to (3,5), the tail is removed, so new positions: head (3,5), and no tail? Length should decrease? No.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nWith two segments: when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves to the previous head position, so the snake occupies the new head position and the previous head position.\n\nSpecifically: start with head H, tail T.\n\nMove head to new position H'.\n\nIf no food, tail moves to H, so new head at H', new tail at H.\n\nIf food, tail stays, so new head at H', body at H, tail at T.\n\nIn this case, turn 4: start head (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nMove U to (3,6): head to (3,6), no food, so tail moves to previous head position (3,5). So new head (3,6), new tail (3,5). The (2,5) is vacated.\n\nNow, from (3,6), move D to (3,5): (3,5) is current tail position. Head moves to (3,5), and since no food, tail moves to previous head position (3,6). So new head (3,5), new tail (3,6). Effectively, the snake moved down to (3,5) and up to (3,6), but positions swapped.\n\nBut no growth.\n\nAnd (3,5) has no food, so no issue.\n\nBut not productive.\n\nFrom (3,6), I could move R to (4,6) or L to (2,6).\n\nSay move R to (4,6).\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen I can continue to (5,6), (6,6) to eat (6,6).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,6) - no food\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,6) - no food, positions head (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6) - no food, positions head (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) - eat food (6,6), score +1, snake grows to length 3: head (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nThen from there, similar to before, only can move L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, or D to (6,5), etc.\n\nMove D to (6,5) which has food, eat it.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5), eat, score +1, grow to length 4: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is there, and I have (4,5) food which I didn't eat.\n\n(4,5) is still available, but now snake is at (6,5), etc.\n\nTo get (4,5), I need to go back, but snake is longer, might be tricky.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate (4,5) and (6,5) and (6,6) quickly.\n\nIn the U move plan, I ate only (6,6) and (6,5) but not (4,5) yet.\n\nAnd (4,5) might be eaten later or not.\n\nBut (4,5) disappears after turn 10, so I have time.\n\nBut in terms of efficiency, eating (4,5) first seems better because it's closer and I get growth earlier.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, by turn 7 I have eaten three foods: (4,5), (6,5), (6,6), score +3, length 5.\n\nIn the second plan, by turn 7 I have eaten one food (6,6), length 3, and about to eat (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nSo first plan is faster.\n\nAlso, for (2,2), I need to go there later.\n\nBut with a longer snake, it might be harder to navigate to (2,2) without hitting itself or walls.\n\nCurrently, the grid has few obstacles, only (1,6) blocked, so plenty of space.\n\nSnake length 5 in a 6x6 grid, but with walls, playable area 6x6 minus one cell, so 35 cells, snake length 5, ok.\n\nI can go to (2,2) later.\n\nNow, back to turn 4 decision.\n\nI think moving R to eat (4,5) is good.\n\nThen from there, I planned to go to (5,5) then (6,5).\n\nBut at turn 5, from (4,5), after eating, I have choices: U, D, R.\n\nI chose R to (5,5), but I could go U or D.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (4,6), then positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (3,5) — after move to (4,6), no food, so tail moves: from [head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)] move to (4,6), no food, so head to (4,6), body to (4,5), tail to (3,5), so positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen I can go to (5,6) or (4,7) invalid, etc.\n\nThen to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut (6,5) is below, I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (4,4), similar.\n\nBut (6,5) is on the way if I go right.\n\nMoreover, (6,5) has longer life than (6,6)? (6,6) life 6, (6,5) life 7, so (6,5) lasts longer, but both will be there.\n\nIn terms of risk, going straight to (6,5) via (5,5) seems fine.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in the sequence, when I have head at (5,5) and tail at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nLater at (5,6) and tail at (5,5), adjacent, but no food on tail.\n\nSo ok.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t1: action\nTurn t1+1: action\n...\n}\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably I need to output a sequence for a few turns, based on the plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns and output the actions for those turns.\n\nt1=4, so turns 4,5,6,7,8 at least.\n\nIn my first plan:\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5) eat food\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5) no food\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat food\n\nThen turn 7: from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) to eat (6,6)\n\nTurn 8: from (6,6), move L to (5,6) no food\n\nBut on turn 8, after moving to (5,6), I need to think further.\n\nBut for now, I can output up to turn 8.\n\nI also have to consider if there are risks.\n\nFor example, after turn 6, head at (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nMove U to (6,6) on turn 7: (6,6) has food, eat, so head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6), as U and R and D invalid.\n\nMove to (5,6), no food, so head (5,6), body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? New head (5,6), body seg1 moves to previous head (6,6), seg2 to previous seg1 (6,5), seg3 to previous seg2 (5,5), tail (3,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, tail at (5,5), head at (5,6), adjacent, but no food on (5,5), so safe.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (2,2).\n\nFor example, move L or D from (5,6).\n\nBut (2,2) is at bottom-left.\n\nI could go west and south.\n\nBut for the sequence, since I need to output from turn 4, with actions.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nIn the output, I should specify the actions for turns 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut on turn 7, I move U to (6,6), which is fine.\n\nIs there a better sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn 4, I move R to (4,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 5, instead of R, I move U to (4,6).\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (5,6) no food, positions head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (6,6) eat food, score +1, grow: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), move D to (6,5) eat food, score +1, grow: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen I have eaten (4,5) on turn 4, (6,6) on turn 7, (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nCompared to first sequence: turn 4 (4,5), turn 6 (6,5), turn 7 (6,6), so same foods, but in different order.\n\nIn first sequence, I ate (6,5) on turn 6 and (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nIn this, I ate (6,6) on turn 7 and (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nBut I have (4,5) in both.\n\nSlightly slower, but not a big difference.\n\nIn the first sequence, after turn 6 I have length 4, after turn 7 length 5.\n\nIn this, after turn 7 I have length 4? Turn 4 eat to length 3, turn 7 eat to length 4, turn 8 to length 5.\n\nWhereas first: turn 4 to len3, turn 6 to len4, turn 7 to len5.\n\nSo first sequence has faster growth.\n\nAlso, in first sequence, on turn 5 I moved to (5,5) which is empty, but that's fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, about the tail: in the position after turn 5 in first sequence: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nAll on row y=5, so it's a horizontal snake.\n\nIf I need to go to (2,2), I can start moving down or left.\n\nFor example, after turn 6: head at (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body? In positions after turn 8: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTail at (5,5), head at (5,6), so I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is tail, so it should be ok to move to it.\n\nMove D to (5,5): head to (5,5), which is current tail, and since no food (assume), tail will move to previous head position (5,6).\n\nSo new head (5,5), new body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? New head (5,5), body seg1 moves to previous head (5,6), seg2 to previous seg1 (6,6), tail to previous seg2 (6,5)? Positions: before move, head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (5,5), which is tail position. Since no food, head moves to (5,5), and tail is removed, and body segments move: seg1 (6,6) moves to previous head (5,6), seg2 (6,5) moves to previous seg1 (6,6), and tail (5,5) is removed, but head is moving there.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5)\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut to go to (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move L to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn earlier, (4,5) was part of snake but moved.\n\nIn this state, after the moves, (4,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), so I need to go down to y=2.\n\nSince I need to output actions for the next few turns, and thinking 5 turns ahead, I should output for turns 4 to 8 or 9.\n\nBut let's stick to the first plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: R (to eat (4,5))\n\nTurn 5: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 6: R (to (6,5) eat)\n\nTurn 7: U (to (6,6) eat)\n\nNow, for turn 8, from (6,6) after eating, move L to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,6), I need to decide.\n\nBut I can output up to turn 8.\n\nThe answer should include the actions.\n\nNow, what about the food at (2,2)? I can get it later, not in the first 5 turns.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are risks in this path.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,5) on turn 5, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nIf I were to move left, but I move right.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (1,6), but it doesn't affect this path since I'm on row 5 and 6.\n\n(1,6) is blocked, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the grid state.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, obstacle at (1,6).\n\nAvailable: x=1-6, y=1-6 except (1,6)\n\nFood: (4,5), (6,6), (6,5), (2,2)\n\nSnake: (3,5) head, (2,5) tail, direction R.\n\nAfter turn 4 R: head to (4,5) eat, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5), no food, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5), eat food, positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)  (since ate, tail stays)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6), eat food, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6), no food, so positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)  (tail (3,5) removed, etc.)\n\nAll safe.\n\nFor turn 8 action, I have L.\n\nNow, I can output turns 4 to 8.\n\nBut turn 8 is t1+4=8.\n\nt1=4, so turns: 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nActions: R, R, R, U, L\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 7 I moved U to (6,6), which is correct.\n\nIs there a way to include (2,2) sooner? Probably not, since it's far.\n\nAnd with longer snake, but I can plan to go there after.\n\nBut for the output, since it's only up to a few turns, I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (4,5) if it causes problem, but it doesn't.\n\nAnother consideration: if I don't eat (4,5), and go directly to (6,5) or something.\n\nFor example, turn 4 move U to (3,6), then turn 5 R to (4,6), turn 6 R to (5,6), turn 7 R to (6,6) eat, then turn 8 D to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut I missed (4,5), and (4,5) might be eaten later or not, but I have to go back, which might be inefficient.\n\nWhereas in the first plan, I get all three foods by turn 7.\n\nAlso, on turn 4, if I move D to (3,4), then I go away from the foods, not good.\n\nSo moving R is best.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n\nThe format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: R\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: L\n}\n\nBut it says \"action on turn\", and \"U (up)\" etc., so probably use the letter.\n\nAlso, in the direction, it's given as U/D/L/R.\n\nI think that's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 4 to 8) based on the current state. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,5) immediately for an easy +1 score and growth, as it is directly accessible and has a limited lifespan (disappears after turn 10).\n- Proceed to eat the food at (6,5) next, as it is on the path and has a longer lifespan (disappears after turn 11), allowing flexibility.\n- Then eat the food at (6,6), which is adjacent and expires after turn 10.\n- Avoid the tail reward danger by ensuring the head is not adjacent to the tail when the tail cell has food (no food is on the tail in this sequence).\n- Ensure no collisions with walls, obstacles, or body segments.\n- After eating these foods, position the snake for potential future movement toward (2,2), which has a long lifespan (disappears after turn 14) and can be targeted later.\n\n### Detailed Plan for Turns 4-8:\n- **Turn 4 (Current Turn)**: Move R (right) to (4,5). This eats the positive food (+1 score), increasing snake length to 3. Positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (right) to (5,5). No food here, so no growth. Positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move R (right) to (6,5). This eats the positive food (+1 score), increasing snake length to 4. Positions: head (6,5), body (5,5) and (4,5), tail (3,5). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move U (up) to (6,6). This eats the positive food (+1 score), increasing snake length to 5. Positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), and (4,5), tail (3,5). Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 8**: Move L (left) to (5,6). No food here, so no growth. Positions: head (5,6), body (6,6) and (6,5), tail (5,5). Head direction becomes L.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: By turns 4-7, the snake eats three positive foods, gaining +3 score and growing to length 5. This is efficient as all foods are eaten with minimal movement.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No wall collisions: All moves stay within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6) and avoid the obstacle at (1,6).\n  - No body collisions: Moves are planned so the head never touches non-tail body segments. For example:\n    - On turn 8, moving to (5,6) is safe as (5,5) is the tail and will move away.\n  - Tail reward danger: At no point is the head adjacent to the tail when the tail cell has food (e.g., on turn 8, head (5,6) and tail (5,5) are adjacent, but (5,5) has no food).\n- **Long-term Survival (5+ turns ahead)**:\n  - After turn 8, the snake is at (5,6) with a clear path to navigate toward (2,2) by moving left/down in future turns. The grid has space (35 playable cells), and the snake length (5) is manageable.\n  - Food at (2,2) has a long lifespan (disappears after turn 14), allowing time to reach it safely.\n  - Avoiding unnecessary risks: This path does not force the snake into tight spaces early on, preserving options for future turns.\n\n### Future Considerations (Beyond Turn 8):\n- To reach (2,2), consider moves like L to (4,6), then D to (4,5) (if empty), and continue southwest. Monitor food lifespans and adjust if needed.\n- If new food spawns, reassess the path, but current foods are prioritized based on proximity and expiration.\n\nThis sequence ensures immediate rewards while setting up for sustainable growth and survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: R\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: L\n}",

No negative food mentioned.\n\nGrid size: Since walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's clarify.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x-coordinates are 1 to 6. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), which is on the top row if y=6 is the top. y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in coordinates, it might vary. Here, since walls are y=0 and y=7, and internal obstacle at (1,6), let's assume the grid is 6x6 with cells from (1,1) to (6,6). But (1,6) is occupied by an obstacle, so it's not playable.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- All cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\n- Additionally, (1,6) is an internal obstacle.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). All on row y=5, from x=3 to x=5. Head at (5,5), moving right, so next position if it continues right would be (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is a valid cell? x=6, y=5. Since x=6 is not a wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 should be playable. Similarly, y=5 is between 1 and 6.\n\nBut (6,5) has food! Food at (6,5) with value 1, life span 5.\n\nAlso food at (6,6) and (2,2).\n\nNow, snake head direction is R, so it's moving right.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer format says to output actions starting from turn t1=6 onwards, for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves, but probably more to ensure survival.\n\nThe output should be like:\n\nTurn 6: action\n\nTurn 7: action\n\n...\n\nBut I need to decide how far to go. I think I should simulate until I can see the consequences of eating food or avoiding dangers.\n\nFirst, let's map out the current grid.\n\nGrid cells:\n\n- Rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\n- Blocked: (1,6) internal obstacle.\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, but since we're only considering playable area, we don't move there.\n\n- Snake: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — head at (5,5)\n\n- Food: (6,6), (6,5), (2,2)\n\nFood at (6,5) is directly in front of the head, since head is at (5,5) moving right, so (6,5) is adjacent.\n\nBut (6,5) has food, and if the snake moves right to (6,5), it will eat it.\n\nNow, rules about eating: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and if positive, length increases by one.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail doesn't move away immediately, causing collision.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,5). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (5,5), tail at (3,5). They are not adjacent; adjacent means next to each other, so (3,5) and (5,5) have (4,5) in between, so not adjacent. Distance is 2 in x-direction.\n\nAdjacent cells are up, down, left, right, one step.\n\nSo head at (5,5) has adjacent cells: (5,6) up, (5,4) down, (4,5) left, (6,5) right.\n\n(4,5) is the body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,5), which is not adjacent to head; it's two steps away.\n\nSo no immediate tail reward danger.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,5) should be safe and the snake will eat the food, growing to length 4.\n\nAfter eating, the tail stays where it is for that turn? No, when the snake eats food, it grows on the next move. Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nRecall the movement: each turn, the snake moves one step in a direction. If it eats food, the tail doesn't retract, so it grows. If not, tail moves forward.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,5), which has food, so it eats it, value +1, length becomes 4. The body segments follow, so the new position would be: head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, (4,5) becomes body, and tail (3,5) stays? No.\n\nSequence: before move, positions: [ (5,5) head, (4,5), (3,5) tail ]\n\nAfter move right: head moves to (6,5), which has food, so it eats, and since food is eaten, the tail does not move. So new positions: head at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), and (3,5) remains as tail? But (3,5) should still be there, but the snake grows, so segments are: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] — so now four segments, tail at (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is the tail, and it will move next time if no food is eaten.\n\nIn terms of collision, after eating, the head is at (6,5), and body segments are (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So no collision since all are distinct.\n\nNow, direction: after moving right, the new head direction is R.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nThere's also food at (6,6) and (2,2).\n\n(6,6) is above (6,5), so if the snake is at (6,5), it could move up to (6,6) to eat that food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is far away.\n\nLife spans: food at (6,6) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn 6. So it will be gone by turn 10, so available on turns 6,7,8,9? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 6, life span is 4, meaning it has 4 turns left, including turn 6. So after 4 moves, it disappears.\n\nLet's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,6): life span 4 at turn 6, so:\n\n- Turn 6: life span 4\n\n- Turn 7: life span 3\n\n- Turn 8: life span 2\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1\n\n- Turn 10: gone\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 5, so disappears after turn 10 (turns 6 to 10).\n\n(2,2): life span 8, disappears after turn 13.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nImmediate move: turn 6, snake can move U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so it can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite, since L would be left, opposite to right).\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. So from R, cannot move L. Can move U, D, or R.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move R to (6,5): eat food, grow to length 4.\n\n- Move U to (5,6): no food there, so just move, tail moves to (4,5), so positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)? After move, if no eat, tail moves.\n\nIf move U to (5,6): no food at (5,6), so head moves to (5,6), then body segments follow: the first body (4,5) moves to (5,5), and tail (3,5) moves to (4,5)? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5)\n\nAfter moving up: head to (5,6), then segment 1 moves to previous head position (5,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (4,5). So new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5). Length still 3.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (5,4): head to (5,4), body to (5,5), tail to (4,5).\n\nOr move R to (6,5): with food, eat, so head to (6,5), body: (5,5) and (4,5), tail stays (3,5), so positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — length 4.\n\nNow, which one to choose? I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), I eat food and grow. Then at (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) to eat another food, or D to (6,4), or L to (5,5), but (5,5) is now part of the body? After moving to (6,5), positions are (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (5,5) is the first body segment.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,6): has food, so can eat it.\n\n- D to (6,4): empty, I assume.\n\n- L to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision and death.\n\n- R: but x=6, right would be x=7, which is wall, so cannot move right.\n\nWalls: x=7 is wall, so from (6,5), moving R to (7,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (6,6): y=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 should be playable, except for internal obstacles.\n\n(6,6) is not blocked, has food.\n\nMoving D to (6,4): y=4, should be fine.\n\nBut moving L to (5,5) is occupied by body, so deadly.\n\nSo from (6,5), only safe moves are U, D, or possibly other directions, but L is blocked by body, R is wall.\n\nU and D are safe.\n\nNow, if I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there, grow to length 5, positions: head to (6,6), then body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)? After eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nBefore move: positions (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nMove U to (6,6): has food, eat, so head to (6,6), then body: (6,5) and (5,5) and (4,5), tail (3,5) stays? No: the segments: the new head is at (6,6), the previous head (6,5) becomes neck, then (5,5) becomes body, (4,5) becomes body, and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so (3,5) remains, but now the snake has segments: [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] — length 5.\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,7): but y=7 is wall, collision.\n\n- D to (6,5): but (6,5) is now occupied by the body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\n- L to (5,6): is this free? (5,6) — is it occupied? Current positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). (5,6) is not occupied, and no wall? x=5,y=6.\n\ny=6, x=5. Is there an obstacle? Internal obstacle at (1,6), but (5,6) should be free.\n\nWalls: only borders and (1,6). So (5,6) is playable.\n\nR to (7,6): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) occupied by body, invalid\n\n- L: (5,6) free, can move\n\n- R: (7,6) wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nAfter moving L to (5,6), no food there (assuming), so just move, tail moves.\n\nPositions before: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nMove L to (5,6): no food, so head to (5,6), then body segments follow: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? The first body segment (6,5) moves to previous head position (6,6), then (5,5) moves to (6,5), (4,5) moves to (5,5), and tail (3,5) moves to (4,5). So new positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5)? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (5,6)\n\n- New body: previous head (6,6) now at position 1\n\n- Previous body (6,5) now at position 2\n\n- Previous body (5,5) now at position 3\n\n- Tail: previous (4,5) moved to (5,5)? Positions: after move, the segments are:\n\n  - Head: (5,6)\n\n  - Segment 1: previous head (6,6)\n\n  - Segment 2: previous segment 1 (6,5)\n\n  - Segment 3: previous segment 2 (5,5)\n\n  - Segment 4: previous segment 3 (4,5) — but the snake has only 4 segments? After eating at (6,6), it had 5 segments: [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter moving to (5,6) with no food:\n\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo segment 1 (was at (6,6)) moves to where head was? No: the body segments follow the head.\n\nStandard: the new head is at (5,6), then the neck is at the previous head position (6,6), but since it moves, the segment that was behind moves to the front.\n\nAfter move, positions:\n\n- Head: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 1: previous head (6,6)\n\n- Segment 2: previous segment 1 (6,5)\n\n- Segment 3: previous segment 2 (5,5)\n\n- Segment 4: previous segment 3 (4,5) — and the tail was (3,5), but since no food, the tail moves off (3,5), so (3,5) is free now.\n\nSo new positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n\nLength still 5.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move, etc.\n\nBut this is getting ahead. Back to turn 6 decision.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move right to (6,5), I eat food and grow to 4. Then at turn 7, I can move up to (6,6) to eat another food, growing to 5. But after that, I'm stuck at (6,6) with only one move possible: left to (5,6). Then from there, I need to navigate.\n\nBut there's also food at (2,2), which is far, and with life span 8, it will be around for a while.\n\nBut if I go to (6,5) and (6,6), I might be cornering myself.\n\nAnother option at turn 6: instead of moving right, I could move up to (5,6) or down to (5,4).\n\nIf I move up to (5,6), no food, so positions become head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5). Length 3.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move to various places.\n\n(5,6) has no food, so after moving, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- U to (5,7): y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body, collision\n\n- L to (4,6): x=4,y=6, is it free? (4,6) — not occupied, no wall.\n\n- R to (6,6): has food.\n\nSo from (5,6), can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf move R to (6,6), eat food, grow to length 4: head to (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5)? After eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions before move: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nMove to (6,6): eat food, so head to (6,6), body: (5,6) and (5,5), tail (4,5) stays. So positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,6), as before, only can move L to (5,6), but (5,6) is now occupied by body! Positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). So (5,6) is segment 1.\n\nMove L to (5,6): (5,6) is occupied, collision.\n\nMove U: wall, D: (6,5) might be free, but (6,5) is not occupied yet? In this state, positions are (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) is free? (6,5) is a different cell.\n\nFrom (6,6), move D to (6,5): is (6,5) occupied? No, not in the current positions. (6,5) has food, but we might have eaten it or not.\n\nIn this scenario, at turn 6, if I moved up to (5,6), then at turn 7 moved to (6,6), eating food, so at turn 7, food at (6,5) is still there, I think.\n\nLet's track food.\n\nAt turn 6, food: (6,6) life span 4, (6,5) life span 5, (2,2) life span 8.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move to (5,6), no eat, so food remains.\n\nThen turn 7, move to (6,6), eat that food, so (6,6) food is consumed.\n\n(6,5) food still there.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6), positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFrom (6,6), move D to (6,5): (6,5) has food, so eat it, grow to length 5.\n\nHead to (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5) stays? After eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nSo positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow, from (6,5), as before, can move U to (6,6) but occupied, or D to (6,4), or L to (5,5) occupied, or R to wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,4) possible.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut again, I might be stuck on the right side.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move down to (5,4), for example.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nThere's food at (2,2) with long life span, I should consider going there, but it's far, and the snake is on the right.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (1,6) might affect top row.\n\nNow, to maximize score, eating both (6,5) and (6,6) gives +2, but then I'm in a tight spot with a longer snake, and the grid has limited space.\n\nGrid is 6x6, but with (1,6) blocked, so 35 cells? Total cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells, minus (1,6) blocked, so 35 playable cells.\n\nSnake length 3, so 32 free cells.\n\nAfter eating two food, length 5, so 30 free cells, but it's getting crowded.\n\nBut there's food at (2,2), I can go there.\n\nBut from the right, it might take time.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, at turn 6, if I don't eat the immediate food at (6,5), it might disappear soon, but life span 5, so it has until turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) has life span 4, until turn 9.\n\n(2,2) has long life.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAnother risk: tail reward danger. But not immediate.\n\nAlso, the snake can wrap around or something, but with walls, it's bounded.\n\nLet's list all possible actions for turn 6.\n\nCurrent position: head (5,5), direction R.\n\nCan move: U, D, R (not L, opposite).\n\nMove R: to (6,5), eat food, grow to 4, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThen turn 7, from (6,5), can move U or D (since L and R blocked).\n\nIf move U to (6,6), eat food, grow to 5, positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8, from (6,6), only move L to (5,6), assuming (5,6) is free. (5,6) is free now, since snake not there.\n\nAfter move to (5,6), no food (assume), so positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5) — after move, tail moves off (3,5), so (3,5) free.\n\nPositions: before move turn 8: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nMove L to (5,6): no food, so head to (5,6), then body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? Segment 1 to (6,6), but (6,6) is current position, no.\n\nAfter move: head (5,6), segment 1: previous head (6,6), segment 2: previous seg1 (6,5), segment 3: previous seg2 (5,5), segment 4: previous seg3 (4,5), and tail previous seg4 (3,5) moves to (4,5)? Since no food, the last segment is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,6), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n\nLength 5.\n\nThen from (5,6), can move: U wall, D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6), R to (6,6) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,6) possible.\n\nMove to (4,6), no food, positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)? After move, tail moves.\n\nBefore: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nMove to (4,6): head to (4,6), seg1 to (5,6), seg2 to (6,6), seg3 to (6,5), seg4 to (5,5), and tail (4,5) moves off, so positions: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5).\n\nNow at (4,6), can move: U wall? y=6, U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), which is not occupied? (4,5) is not in positions, positions are (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nL to (3,6), R to (5,6) occupied.\n\nSo can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nAnd so on. I can eventually go down or left to reach (2,2), but it might take many turns.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move up to (5,6).\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6), no eat, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,6), can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6) (to eat food).\n\nIf move R to (6,6), eat, grow to 4: positions (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 8, from (6,6), can move D to (6,5) since L to (5,6) occupied.\n\nMove D to (6,5), which has food, eat, grow to 5: positions (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 9, from (6,5), can move D to (6,4) or U to (6,6) occupied, so only D to (6,4)\n\nThen continue down.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat both foods on the right, but then I have a long snake and need to navigate carefully.\n\nAt turn 6, I could move down to (5,4) to avoid eating immediately.\n\nMove D to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U, D, L, R, but direction from moving down, so head direction D.\n\nCan move to (5,5) but occupied, or (5,3), or (4,4), or (6,4).\n\n(5,5) occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nMove U to (5,5) occupied, invalid.\n\nMove D to (5,3), possible.\n\nMove L to (4,4), possible.\n\nMove R to (6,4), possible.\n\nSo options.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,2) or back to food.\n\nBut food at (6,5) and (6,6) may expire soon.\n\nLife span: (6,6) expires after turn 9, so available turns 6,7,8,9.\n\n(6,5) expires after turn 10.\n\n(2,2) after turn 13.\n\nAt turn 6, if I don't eat, I might miss (6,6) if I don't go there soon.\n\nSince (6,6) has only 4 turns left, including turn 6, so if I don't eat it by turn 9, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger for the future.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) is under the snake? No, currently, snake is at (3,5),(4,5),(5,5), so (6,5) is not under snake, it's free.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but in this case, it's not.\n\nFor example, if food was under body, it could only be eaten when body moves away and head moves there.\n\nBut here, all food is free.\n\nNow, to prioritize long-term survival, eating both foods on the right might not be best because it leaves me with a long snake in a corner.\n\nI could eat only one or none and go for the center or left.\n\nBut (2,2) is on the bottom-left.\n\nLet's coordinate: assume (1,1) bottom-left, (6,6) top-right, with y increasing up.\n\nSo (2,2) is near bottom-left.\n\nSnake at (5,5) center-right.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,6), top-left corner blocked.\n\nSo to go to (2,2), I need to move left and down.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I move down to (5,4), then I can go left.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nSince the answer requires actions for multiple turns, I need to output a sequence starting from turn 6.\n\nI should aim for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to decide the first move.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 6, move right to (6,5) and eat, then at turn 7, instead of moving up, move down to (6,4) to avoid the corner.\n\nLet's try.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5), eat, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  length 4\n\nTurn 7: from (6,5), move D to (6,4), no food (assume), so just move, tail moves to (4,5)? Positions before: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nMove D to (6,4): no food, so head to (6,4), then body: (6,5) moves to (6,5)? Seg1 to previous head (6,5), seg2 to previous seg1 (5,5), seg3 to previous seg2 (4,5), and tail (3,5) moves off, so positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  tail at (4,5)\n\nLength 4.\n\nThen from (6,4), can move U to (6,5) occupied, D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R wall.\n\nSo move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nThen I can go down or left.\n\nFood at (6,6) is still there, but I didn't eat it, so I can go back up later, but with life span, by turn 10 it's gone.\n\nBut at turn 7, I moved down, so I'm at (6,4), and (6,6) is above.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move up to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by body, so I can't.\n\nOnly after the body moves.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, from (6,4), move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf move L to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5)? Before move: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nMove to (5,4): head (5,4), seg1 to (6,4), seg2 to (6,5), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (4,5) — tail at (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), can move to various places.\n\nBut (6,6) is still there, but I can't reach it easily from here because of the body.\n\nTo reach (6,6), I need to go around, but it might expire.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (6,5) is gone because I ate it or it's expired, but I ate it at turn 6.\n\n(6,5) is eaten, (6,6) is uneaten.\n\nAt turn 6, I ate (6,5), so it's gone.\n\n(6,6) is still there.\n\nBut from the current position at turn 7 or 8, I'm at (6,4) or (5,4), and (6,6) is at (6,6), with body at (6,5), so I can't move directly to it.\n\nI need to move away to free space.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (6,3), then left, etc., but by the time I come back, (6,6) may be gone.\n\nLife span of (6,6): at turn 6, life span 4, so turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10: gone.\n\nSo if I don't eat it by turn 9, it's gone.\n\nAt turn 6, I'm at (6,5), if I move up to (6,6) on turn 7, I eat it.\n\nIf I move down on turn 7, I miss the opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat at turn 6, I can eat later.\n\nLet's consider not eating at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), move R to (6,6), eat food, grow to 4: positions (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (6,6), move D to (6,5), which has food? (6,5) food was not eaten, but at turn 7, when I moved to (6,6), I didn't touch (6,5), so (6,5) food is still there with life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 6, (6,5) life span 5, turn 7:4, turn 8:3, etc.\n\nSo at turn 8, from (6,6), move D to (6,5), eat food, grow to 5: positions (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) or other, but only D possible.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr at turn 7, from (5,6), instead of moving R, move L to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)? Before move: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nMove L to (4,6): no food, so head (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)? After move: head (4,6), seg1 to (5,6), seg2 to (5,5), and tail (4,5) moves off, so positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), length 3.\n\nThen from (4,6), can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6) or U wall, R to (5,6) occupied.\n\n(4,5) is free, so move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nThen I can go down towards (2,2).\n\nAnd the foods on right are still there for a few turns, but I can choose to eat them or not.\n\nSince (2,2) has longer life span, I can go there first.\n\nBut it's at (2,2), and I'm at (4,6), so I need to move left and down.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), move D to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), tail (5,6)? Before: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nMove to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (5,6), and tail (5,5) moves off, so positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6) — tail at (5,6)\n\nThen from (4,5), can move to (4,4), (3,5), (5,5) but (5,5) may be free, etc.\n\n(5,5) is free now.\n\nThen I can move to (3,5), etc., towards (2,2).\n\nBut food at (6,6) expires soon, so I might miss it.\n\nSince it's only +1, and I have (2,2) with +1, it might not be worth the risk to go back.\n\nPrioritize long-term, so going for (2,2) might be better as it gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I can eat one food on the right and then go left.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 6 action.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (3,5), and if I move away, it might free space.\n\nBut no food under tail.\n\nI think for long-term survival, it's better to keep the snake shorter for now and go for the distant food, avoiding the corner.\n\nSo at turn 6, move U to (5,6) or D to (5,4).\n\nLet's choose U to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (4,6) to start going left.\n\nThen down to (4,5), etc.\n\nOr I can move R to (6,6) to eat, but that might corner me.\n\nSince the answer requires multiple turns, I need to output a sequence.\n\nLet's plan a path to (2,2).\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6) at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6), positions: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), move L to (4,6), positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)  (tail (4,5) moved off)\n\nPositions: head (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,6), move D to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), tail (5,6)\n\nBefore: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nMove D to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (5,6), and tail (5,5) moves off, so positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)  tail at (5,6)\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nBefore: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nMove L to (3,5): head (3,5), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (4,6), tail (5,6) moves off, positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)  tail at (4,6)\n\nTurn 10: from (3,5), move D to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAnd so on, towards (2,2).\n\nBut at turn 10, (6,5) food expires, (6,6) expired at turn 10? (6,6) life span 4 from turn 6, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) gone at turn 11? Life span 5, turn 6:5, turn 7:4, turn 8:3, turn 9:2, turn 10:1, turn 11: gone.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), from (3,4), I can move to (3,3), (2,4), etc., to reach (2,2) by say turn 12 or so.\n\nFor example, turn 10: at (3,4), move D to (3,3) or L to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 6 to some turn.\n\nSince the food at (2,2) has life span 8, it will be there.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat any food, length still 3, so I can eat (2,2) later.\n\nBut I might miss the other foods, but they are only +1 each, and with risk.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat one food if possible without risk.\n\nAt turn 6, move R to (6,5) to eat, then at turn 7 move D to (6,4) to avoid the corner.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nLet's say move L to (5,4) at turn 7.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5), eat, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  length 4\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,4), no food, positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  tail at (4,5)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5)  before: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nMove to (5,4): head (5,4), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5)  tail at (4,5)\n\nPositions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), can move to (5,3), (4,4), (6,4) occupied, (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nThen I can go down or left.\n\nAnd (6,6) food is still there, but I can't reach it directly, and it expires soon.\n\nSo I might not eat it.\n\nBut I ate one food, so length 4.\n\nThen I can go to (2,2).\n\nIn terms of score, eating one is better than none.\n\nIf I eat both, I have length 5, which might be harder to maneuever in small grid.\n\nGrid 6x6 with obstacle, 35 cells, snake length 5, 30 free, but with walls, it might be tight.\n\nBut possible to survive.\n\nBut for long-term, shorter snake is easier.\n\nSince there's only three food, all +1, eating all gives +3, but with risk.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should try to eat as many as possible while surviving.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 6, move R to (6,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 7, move U to (6,6) eat, grow to 5.\n\nThen turn 8, move L to (5,6), no eat, positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5)  after move, tail moves off (3,5), so positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,6), move L to (4,6), no food, positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)  before: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nMove to (4,6): head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (5,5), tail (4,5) moves off, positions: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)  tail at (5,5)\n\nThen from (4,6), can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6), etc.\n\nThen I can go down to (4,5), but (4,5) is free? In positions, (5,5) is occupied, but (4,5) is free.\n\nMove D to (4,5), no food, and so on.\n\nI can reach (2,2) eventually.\n\nAnd food at (2,2) is still there if I move fast.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 9, I'm at (4,6), (2,2) is at distance, I need to go to (3,5) or something.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 9, move D to (4,5) turn 10, then L to (3,5) turn 11, then D to (3,4) turn 12, then L to (2,4) turn 13, then D to (2,3) or (2,2) if possible, but (2,2) might expire.\n\nLife span of (2,2): 8 from turn 6, so turn 6:8, turn 7:7, ..., turn 13:1, turn 14: gone.\n\nSo at turn 13, it is still there if life span 1.\n\nAt turn 13, if I am at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) to eat.\n\nSo possible.\n\nIn this case, I ate two foods and can eat the third.\n\nWith snake length 5 after eating two, then eating (2,2) makes length 6.\n\nBut in small grid, it might be risky, but possible.\n\nIf I eat only one or none, I have lower score.\n\nSo best to eat all three.\n\nBut in the first scenario, if I go directly to (2,2) without eating right food, I can eat (2,2) with shorter snake.\n\nBut I miss the other two.\n\nSo eating all three gives higher score.\n\nNow, for the tail reward danger: in this path, when I eat (2,2), the head should not be adjacent to tail when the tail has food, but in this case, no food under tail, so should be fine.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (1,6) is not in the way for now.\n\nSo let's go with eating both on right and then to (2,2).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat food.\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (6,6) eat food.\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (5,6) no eat.\n\nNow, from (5,6), I need to go left and down.\n\nAt turn 8, positions after move: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5) as before.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,6), move L to (4,6) no eat.\n\nPositions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5) — tail at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 10: from (4,6), move D to (4,5) no eat.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5) — before move: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nMove to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (6,6), seg4 (6,5), tail (5,5) moves off, so positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n\nThen from (4,5), can move to (4,4), (3,5), (5,5) but (5,5) is free now? In positions, (5,5) is not there, so free.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nMove L to (3,5) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (2,2), move L to (3,5) at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), tail (6,6) — before: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)\n\nMove to (3,5): head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (6,6), tail (6,5) moves off, positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) tail at (6,6)\n\nThen turn 12: from (3,5), move D to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), tail (5,6)\n\nBefore: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\nMove to (3,4): head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (5,6), tail (6,6) moves off, positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6) tail at (5,6)\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,4), move L to (2,4), no food, positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nBefore: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nMove to (2,4): head (2,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (4,6), tail (5,6) moves off, positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,4), move D to (2,3), no food, positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 15: move D to (2,2), which has food, eat, grow to 6.\n\nAt turn 15, food at (2,2) life span: from turn 6, life span 8, turn 6:8, turn7:7, ..., turn13:1, turn14:0, so at turn 14 it is gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, disappears after N turns.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nAt turn 6, life span 8, so it has 8 turns including turn 6, so available until turn 13 (turn 13 life span 1), gone on turn 14.\n\nAt turn 13, life span is 1, so on turn 13, it is still there, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 13, it disappears, so on turn 14, it's gone.\n\nIn my plan, at turn 13, I am at (2,4), and (2,2) is at (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move directly to (2,2)? Not adjacent, need to go down.\n\nAt turn 13, from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3), then on turn 14, move D to (2,2).\n\nBut on turn 14, (2,2) is gone, since after turn 13 it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 6, N=8, so disappears after 8 turns, meaning after turn 13 it is gone.\n\nAvailable on turns when countdown >0.\n\nAt turn t, if life span at turn t is L, it can be eaten on turn t, and will be gone when countdown reaches 0.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t+N it is gone.\n\nFor (2,2), N=8 at turn 6, so disappears after turn 6+8=14? After N turns from current.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — after N turns from now.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, life span 4 for (6,6), disappears after 4 turns, so after turn 9, gone on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) life span 8, disappears after 8 turns, so after turn 13, gone on turn 14.\n\nSo at turn 13, it is still there (countdown 1), can be eaten on turn 13.\n\nAt turn 14, gone.\n\nIn the path, at turn 13, I am at (2,4), and (2,2) is two steps away.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move D to (2,3) on turn 13, but (2,2) is not adjacent, I need to move to (2,3) first.\n\nThen on turn 14, move D to (2,2), but on turn 14, (2,2) is gone.\n\nI cannot eat it on turn 14.\n\nI need to be at (2,2) on turn 13 to eat it.\n\nIn my earlier path, at turn 13, I am at (2,4), not at (2,2).\n\nI need to reach (2,2) by turn 13.\n\nLet's optimize the path to (2,2).\n\nFrom the beginning.\n\nTurn 6: head at (5,5)\n\nMove U to (5,6) to go left.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6), positions: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,6), positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,5), positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5), positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (3,4), positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (2,4), positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (2,3), positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: move D to (2,2), eat food, grow to 4.\n\nYes, on turn 13, eat (2,2).\n\nAnd I didn't eat the other foods, so score +1.\n\nBut if I eat the right foods, I can have +2 or +3.\n\nWith the earlier path eating two, I can reach (2,2) on turn 13? Let's see.\n\nFrom turn 6: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (2,4)? (2,4) not (2,2)\n\nFrom (3,4), to (2,2), I need to go to (2,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nAt turn 13, at (3,4), move L to (2,4), then turn 14 move D to (2,3), turn 15 move D to (2,2) but food gone.\n\nCannot eat (2,2) if I eat the right foods.\n\nSo trade-off.\n\nEat only (2,2) and one other, or all.\n\nBut to eat all, I need to be at (6,6) by turn 9 and at (2,2) by turn 13, which is difficult from the right corner.\n\nFor example, from (6,6) at turn 7, to (2,2) at turn 13, 6 turns, Manhattan distance 8, possible with snake moves.\n\nBut with body, it might not be direct.\n\nFrom turn 7: at (6,6) after eating, positions (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) if I ate both.\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (5,6) as before.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3), but not (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,2) is not adjacent; I can move to (2,4) or (3,3) or (2,3) not directly.\n\nSo on turn 13, I can be at (2,3) or (3,3), not (2,2).\n\nSo I miss (2,2).\n\nTherefore, it's better to go directly to (2,2) without eating the right foods to ensure I eat it, or eat only one.\n\nSince (6,5) has life span 5, I can eat it later, but it's on the right, and I'm going left.\n\nAt turn 6, move down to (5,4) then left.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nFor long-term, eating (2,2) is safer, and I can survive longer to find more food, but no more food is mentioned, so only these three.\n\nThe state has only these food, so I should try to eat as many as possible.\n\nBut to eat all, I need a better path.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,4) to avoid corner.\n\nThen from there, go left and down quickly.\n\nTurn 7: at (6,4), positions (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,4), positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4), no food, positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), tail (5,5)  before: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nMove to (4,4): head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (5,5), tail moves off, positions: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nAnd so on, not reaching (2,2) soon.\n\nI think it's not possible to eat both right foods and (2,2) with the life spans.\n\nSo perhaps eat only (2,2) or eat the right foods and forget (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) has value 1, same as others.\n\nSince the snake is shorter, going for (2,2) first might allow me to survive longer and possibly find more food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so only these three.\n\nThe state is given, so I think only these food are present.\n\nTo maximize score, eating two is better than one.\n\nFor example, eat (6,5) and (6,6), score +2, length 5, then survive.\n\nOr eat only (2,2), score +1, length 4.\n\nOr eat nothing, score 0, length 3.\n\nSo best to eat two.\n\nAnd (2,2) might be eaten if I can, but with life span, I may not reach in time.\n\nSo I'll go with eating the two on the right.\n\nFor the action sequence, I need to output from turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move R\n\nTurn 7: move U\n\nTurn 8: move L\n\nThen for turn 9, from (5,6), move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 10: from (4,6), move D to (4,5)\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to specify for 5+ turns.\n\nLet's output for 5 turns: turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6) no eat\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,6) no eat\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,5) no eat\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nIn turn 9, from (5,6), after move L to (4,6), positions as before.\n\nBut in the sequence, I don't need to specify positions, just actions.\n\nAlso, for the direction, after each move, the head direction changes.\n\nBut for the action, I just output the move.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: L\nTurn 9: L\nTurn 10: D\n}\n\nBut turn 9 move L from (5,6) to (4,6), which is left, so L.\n\nThen turn 10 move D from (4,6) to (4,5), down.\n\nThen I can add more if needed, but the format doesn't specify how many, but \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so 5 turns should be fine.\n\nTo be safe, I can do 6 turns.\n\nBut let's see if this is safe.\n\nIn this path, at turn 6 to 10, I ate two food, and I'm at (4,5) at turn 10, with snake length 5, and I can continue to move to open space.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nIf I move down at turn 7 instead of up, I eat only one, but then I can go to (2,2), but I may not reach in time.\n\nFor example, turn 6: move R eat (6,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3)\n\nThen from there, go to (2,2), but by turn 13 or 14, food may be gone.\n\nSo not better.\n\nSo the first plan is fine.\n\nI think move R then U is ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 6 to 10). The strategy involves eating the positive food at (6,5) and (6,6) immediately to gain +2 score, as they have short life spans (disappearing after turns 10 and 9, respectively). After eating, the snake grows to length 5, and moves are then focused on navigating away from the top-right corner to avoid dead ends and body collisions, while positioning to potentially reach the food at (2,2) later if possible (though it may expire by turn 14 based on its life span of 8).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Food Opportunity**: At turn 6, moving right to (6,5) eats the food (+1, length increases to 4). Then, moving up to (6,6) at turn 7 eats another food (+1, length increases to 5). Both foods are consumed before they expire.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - After eating at (6,6), the snake is in a corner with limited moves. Moving left to (5,6) at turn 8 avoids collision and starts escaping the corner.\n  - Subsequent moves (left to (4,6) at turn 9 and down to (4,5) at turn 10) open up space and reduce collision risks by moving toward the center of the grid.\n  - The food at (2,2) is not targeted immediately due to distance and life span; it can be pursued later if feasible, but survival is prioritized.\n- **Life Spans**:\n  - (6,6): Life span 4 at turn 6, disappears after turn 9 (eaten at turn 7).\n  - (6,5): Life span 5 at turn 6, disappears after turn 10 (eaten at turn 6).\n  - (2,2): Life span 8 at turn 6, disappears after turn 13; not eaten in this sequence but may be targeted in later turns if the snake navigates closer.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is right (R) at turn 6, so left (L) is invalid on turn 6 (no instant reverse).\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (1,6) are respected.\n  - Body collision is avoided by not moving into occupied cells (e.g., after turn 7, moving left from (6,6) is safe because (5,6) is free).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Eating both nearby foods quickly gains score, but moves from turn 8 onward focus on moving left and down to access open areas. The snake length (5) is manageable in the 6x6 grid (35 playable cells), and future moves can explore toward (2,2) or other areas to avoid trapping.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 6 to 10):\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (6,5) to eat the food (+1, length becomes 4). The head is now at (6,5), direction R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to (6,6) to eat the food (+1, length becomes 5). The head is now at (6,6), direction U.\n- **Turn 8**: Move left (L) to (5,6) to avoid the top-right corner and body collision (no food eaten). The head is now at (5,6), direction L.\n- **Turn 9**: Move left (L) to (4,6) to continue escaping the corner and open space (no food eaten). The head is now at (4,6), direction L.\n- **Turn 10**: Move down (D) to (4,5) to navigate toward the center and avoid walls (no food eaten). The head is now at (4,5), direction D.\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 10):\n- From (4,5) at turn 10, the snake can move left to (3,5) or down to (4,4) to approach (2,2), but the food at (2,2) expires after turn 13. Given the distance, it may not be reachable by turn 13, so survival should be prioritized by exploring open cells.\n- If (2,2) is not eaten, the snake can continue moving to avoid dead ends and seek new opportunities.\n\nThis sequence ensures +2 score with minimal risk, and the snake is positioned for further exploration.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: L\nTurn 9: L\nTurn 10: D\n}",
