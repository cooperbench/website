        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates:\n     - (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake is currently just a single segment at (3, 3), which is both its head and tail.\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food, all with a value of +1 and a life span of 10 turns:\n     - (2, 4)\n     - (1, 3)\n     - (4, 1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Left (L), it cannot make an instant reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, the possible moves are U, D, or L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: Current direction is L, so moving L is allowed.\n   - New head position: (3 - 1, 3) = (2, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: (2, 3) is an internal obstacle (from the list), so this is a wall. **Invalid move**.\n   \n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 3 + 1) = (3, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: (3, 4) is not in the border or internal walls.\n     - **Body**: The snake is only at (3, 3), so no body collision.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - After moving, the snake's new position would be [(3, 4), (3, 3)], but since the snake is length 1, it's just [(3, 4)].\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 3 - 1) = (3, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - **Wall**: (3, 2) is an internal obstacle. **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid moves are Up (U). \n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up leads to eating food:\n\n- New head position after U: (3, 4)\n- Food positions:\n  - (2, 4): Not (3, 4)\n  - (1, 3): Not (3, 4)\n  - (4, 1): Not (3, 4)\n  \nNo food is at (3, 4), so moving Up doesn't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Are There Other Valid Moves?\n\nFrom the initial check, only Up is valid. Left and Down hit walls, and Right is an instant reverse which is not allowed.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nEven though no food is eaten this turn, moving Up is safe and opens up more possibilities for future moves. Here's why:\n\n- After moving to (3, 4), next turn the snake can potentially move towards the food at (2, 4) or (1, 3), depending on the direction chosen next.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Currently, the snake is length 1, so the head is also the tail. After moving Up, the tail (which was at (3, 3)) is gone (since the snake moves entirely to (3, 4)). So, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move at this turn is Up (U). \n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\n   - This is the first turn of the game.\n\n2. **Cells occupied by walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n     - This means the grid is bounded by walls at these coordinates. The playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)]\n     - These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake cannot pass through.\n\n3. **Snake Positions**: [(3, 4)]\n   - The snake currently consists of only its head at position (3, 4).\n   - Since there's only one segment, the tail is also at (3, 4).\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: U (Up)\n   - The snake is currently moving upwards, meaning its last move was in the direction where y increases (from (3,3) to (3,4), assuming the previous position was (3,3)).\n\n5. **Food Positions, Life Span, and Value**:\n   - (2, 4, 9, 1): Position (2,4), value = +1, life span = 9 turns\n   - (1, 3, 9, 1): Position (1,3), value = +1, life span = 9 turns\n   - (4, 1, 9, 1): Position (4,1), value = +1, life span = 9 turns\n   - (6, 2, 10, 1): Position (6,2), value = +1, life span = 10 turns\n   - All foods are positive (+1 value), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the grid. The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Walls are at the borders and the specified internal obstacles.\n\n- **Snake Head**: (3,4)\n- **Food Locations**:\n  - (2,4)\n  - (1,3)\n  - (4,1)\n  - (6,2)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is U, the snake cannot instantly reverse to D (No instant reverse rule).\n\nSo, possible moves at this turn are: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the border, but (3,5) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: Check if (3,5) is in the list. It's not.\n     - Body collision: The snake has only one segment, so no body to collide with.\n   - Is there food at (3,5)? No.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (3,5), no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is border, (2,4) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is not in the list.\n     - Body collision: Only head at (3,4), moving to (2,4) is safe.\n   - Is there food at (2,4)? Yes, value = +1, life span = 9.\n     - Since the snake is length 1, the tail is at (3,4). After moving to (2,4), the tail moves away from (3,4), and the head is now on (2,4) where food is present.\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The head is moving to (2,4), and the tail is at (3,4). After eating, the snake grows to length 2, with new tail at (3,4). The head is at (2,4), which is adjacent to (3,4) (tail). This is the Tail Reward Danger scenario where the head is adjacent to the tail after eating, leading to a collision in the next move.\n     - Therefore, eating this food is deadly.\n   - Outcome: If we move left, we eat the food but die immediately after due to Tail Reward Danger. Hence, this is not a safe move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (4,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is border, (4,4) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is not in the list.\n     - Body collision: Only head at (3,4), moving to (4,4) is safe.\n   - Is there food at (4,4)? No.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (4,4), no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, no food.\n- **Left (L)**: Eats food but leads to death (Tail Reward Danger).\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, no food.\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe but don't eat food. Since the snake is length 1, moving towards food is generally good, but the immediate food at (2,4) is dangerous to eat. \n\nLooking at other foods:\n\n- (1,3): To reach this, from (3,4), possible path: Left to (2,4) (dangerous), then Down to (2,3) (but (2,3) is a wall), so not reachable safely.\n- (4,1): From (3,4), could go Right to (4,4), then Down to (4,3), then Down to (4,2), then Down to (4,1). But (4,5) and (4,6) are walls, but not blocking this path directly. However, this is multiple moves away.\n- (6,2): From (3,4), would need several right and down moves.\n\nGiven that, in the immediate next move, moving Up or Right are the only safe options, and neither leads to food. \n\nBetween U and R, moving Right might be slightly better as it opens up the possibility to go down towards (4,1) in future moves, whereas Up moves towards the top where there's no immediate food.\n\nHowever, since the snake is length 1, and the food at (2,4) is dangerous to eat, the safest immediate move is to avoid eating it and choose a direction that doesn't lead to immediate danger.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nIf we move Right to (4,4), next possible moves from there (assuming direction becomes R):\n- Cannot move Left (instant reverse).\n- Can move Up, Right, or Down.\n  - Up to (4,5): (4,5) is not a wall, but (4,5) is an internal obstacle (from the list: (4,5) is present). So cannot move Up.\n  - Right to (5,4): Safe.\n  - Down to (4,3): Safe.\n\nSo moving Right now allows more flexibility in the next move compared to moving Up, where from (3,5), possible moves would be U, L, R (no D), but no immediate food in those directions either.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Moving Left is deadly.\n- Moving Up or Right are safe but don't eat food.\n- Moving Right seems to offer slightly better future options.\n\nHowever, since the snake is length 1, and the food at (2,4) is dangerous to eat due to Tail Reward Danger, the safest immediate move is to avoid eating it and choose a direction that doesn't lead to immediate danger. \n\nBetween U and R, both are equally safe in the immediate turn, but R might be slightly better for future options.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the game state and the rules thoroughly. Here's what's given:\n\n- **Current Turn (t₀):** 2\n- **Walls:**\n  - **Border Cells:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7))\n  - **Internal Obstacles:** A list of coordinates where the snake cannot move.\n- **Snake Positions:** The snake is currently at [(4,4)], meaning it's just the head with no body segments (length = 1).\n- **Snake Head Direction:** Currently moving Right (R).\n- **Food Items:** Four pieces of food with their positions, values, and remaining life spans:\n  1. (2,4) with value 8, life span 1\n  2. (1,3) with value 8, life span 1\n  3. (4,1) with value 8, life span 1\n  4. (6,2) with value 9, life span 1\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n1. **Snake Length:** The snake is of length 1, meaning only the head exists. This simplifies movement because there's no body to collide with except itself (which isn't possible here).\n2. **Current Direction:** The snake is moving Right (R), so its next position if it continues Right would be (5,4).\n3. **No Instant Reverse:** Since the current direction is R, the snake cannot move Left (L) in the next turn.\n4. **Food Values:** All food items have positive values (+1), so eating any is beneficial. There's no negative food in this scenario.\n5. **Life Spans:** All food items have a life span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n6. **Wall and Obstacle Positions:** Need to ensure that the next move doesn't hit a wall or an internal obstacle.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current position (4,4) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U):** (4,5)\n- **Down (D):** (4,3)\n- **Right (R):** (5,4)\n- **Left (L):** (3,4) — but current direction is R, so L is the opposite and not allowed.\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move to see if it's safe and if it can lead to eating food.\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (5,4):**\n   - Check walls/obstacles: \n     - Border walls: x=7 is at the edge, (5,4) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,4) is not in the list.\n   - Food: No food at (5,4).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,5):**\n   - Check walls/obstacles:\n     - y=7 is the top border, (4,5) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is not listed.\n   - Food: No food at (4,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,3):**\n   - Check walls/obstacles:\n     - y=0 is the bottom, (4,3) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,3) is not listed.\n   - Food: No food at (4,3).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no reward.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But all food items have a life span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. So, if we don't eat any now, they'll be gone next turn.\n\nHowever, looking at the food positions:\n\n1. (2,4): Distance from (4,4) is |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 (Manhattan distance)\n2. (1,3): Distance is |4-1| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n3. (4,1): Distance is |4-4| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3\n4. (6,2): Distance is |4-6| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe closest food is at (2,4), which is 2 units away. But since we can only move one step per turn, we can't reach it this turn. \n\nWait, but the snake is at (4,4), and food is at (2,4). To reach (2,4), we'd need to move left twice, but:\n\n- Current direction is R. Next move cannot be L (opposite). So, we cannot move left this turn.\n  \nThus, (2,4) is inaccessible this turn because we can't move left immediately after moving right.\n\nNext closest is (4,1), which is 3 units away. To reach (4,1) from (4,4), we'd need to move down three times. \n\nBut can we start moving down this turn? Yes, D is allowed (not opposite to R).\n\nIf we move D to (4,3), then next turn we can move D again to (4,2), then D to (4,1). But the food at (4,1) will disappear after this turn (life span 1, current turn is 2, so it was there at turn 1, disappears after turn 1? Wait, need to clarify life span.\n\n**Life Span Interpretation:**\nThe food appears at some turn and disappears after N turns from appearance. Here, life span is 1, meaning it appears and disappears in the same turn? That doesn't make sense. Maybe life span is the number of turns it remains after appearing. \n\nGiven that at turn 2, life span is 1, so it disappears at the end of turn 2. So, we have this turn (turn 2) to eat it before it disappears at the end of turn 2.\n\nBut to eat (4,1), we'd need to be at (4,1) now, but we're at (4,4). So, can't eat it this turn.\n\nSimilarly for other foods:\n\n- (2,4): Can't reach this turn (need left move, but can't).\n- (1,3): Too far.\n- (6,2): Need to move right then down, but can't reach in one turn.\n\nThus, none of the food can be eaten this turn because they're all at least 2 units away, and we can only move one unit per turn.\n\nGiven that, the best we can do is move towards the closest food for future turns, even though they'll disappear after this turn. But since they'll be gone, maybe it's better to just move safely to a position where we can look for new food that might spawn next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nSince the snake has no body segments (only head), the only dangers are walls and obstacles. All possible moves (U, D, R) are safe in that regard.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, and all moves are safe, we can choose any of U, D, R. \n\nBut to maximize future opportunities, we might want to move towards areas where food is more likely to appear or where we can explore more of the grid. \n\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,4): Takes us towards the center-right.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,5): Towards the top.\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,3): Towards the bottom.\n\nGiven that there are internal obstacles like (4,5) is not an obstacle, but (4,6) is, but that's not immediately relevant. \n\nSince no immediate benefit, random choice is okay, but perhaps moving Right keeps us moving in the same direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to change.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down towards (4,1) food is not useful since it disappears, but maybe new food appears there. \n\nGiven no clear preference, and since the current direction is R, continuing R might be simplest.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, since no food can be eaten this turn and all possible moves are safe, the simplest action is to continue moving in the current direction, Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 3 \\)\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)]. These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake is currently just a single segment at [(5, 4)]. This means the snake's head is at (5,4), and since there's only one segment, there is no body or tail yet.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (\"R\").\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 4): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (4, 1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (6, 2): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is currently moving Right (\"R\"), the possible next moves are:\n- **Continue Right (R)**: Move to (6,4)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (5,5)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (5,3)\n  \nWe cannot move Left (\"L\") because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of current direction \"R\"), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check for walls:\n  - x=7 is a border wall, but we're moving to x=6, which is within bounds.\n  - No internal walls at (6,4).\n- Check for food:\n  - No food is listed at (6,4).\n- Safety:\n  - The snake has no body segments yet, so no risk of collision with itself.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't collect any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,5)\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- Check for walls:\n  - y=7 is the upper border, (5,5) is within bounds.\n  - No internal walls at (5,5).\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (5,5).\n- Safety:\n  - No body to collide with.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't collect food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for walls:\n  - y=0 is the lower border, (5,3) is within bounds.\n  - No internal walls at (5,3).\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (5,3).\n- Safety:\n  - No body to collide with.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't collect food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Collection\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate adjacent cells to the snake's head (5,4) contain food. The closest foods are:\n- (2,4): distance of 3 left (but moving left is not allowed currently)\n- (1,3): even further left\n- (4,1): down and left\n- (6,2): right and down\n\nGiven that moving Right doesn't immediately collect food but moves us closer to (6,2), which is at (6,2). From (6,4), we could then consider moving down to (6,3) and then to (6,2) to collect that food.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (5,3) doesn't immediately help in reaching any food, and moving Up to (5,5) also doesn't bring us closer to any food quickly.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe but don't collect food, the best strategy is to move towards the nearest food that can be safely reached in subsequent turns. The food at (6,2) is the closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (5,4):\n\n- Current position: (5,4)\n- To reach (6,2):\n  - First move Right to (6,4)\n  - Then Down to (6,3)\n  - Then Down to (6,2)\n\nThis path doesn't hit any walls and is safe given the current snake length (no body to collide with).\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (5,3) doesn't seem to lead us directly to any food quickly.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nSince the snake is length 1, there are no body segments to collide with. The only dangers are walls, which we've already checked for in each possible move.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Right is safe and moves us closer to the food at (6,2).\n- Moving Up or Down are safe but don't help in reaching food quickly.\n- Moving Left is not allowed (instant reverse).\n\nThe best immediate action is to continue moving Right to position ourselves for collecting the food at (6,2) in subsequent turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n- **Internal obstacles:** There are several internal walls at specific coordinates:\n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake:**\n- **Positions:** The snake is currently just a single segment at [(6,4)]. This means the snake's head is at (6,4), and since it's the only segment, there's no body or tail yet.\n- **Head Direction:** The snake is currently moving to the Right (\"R\").\n\n**Food Items:**\nThere are five food items on the grid, each with their position (x,y), life span, and value:\n1. (2,4) - life span: 6, value: +1\n2. (1,3) - life span: 6, value: +1\n3. (4,1) - life span: 6, value: +1\n4. (6,2) - life span: 7, value: +1\n5. (6,4) - life span: 10, value: +1\n\n**Observations:**\n- The snake is very short (length 1), so there's no body to collide with except walls and itself (which isn't possible yet).\n- The current head direction is Right (\"R\"), so the snake is moving towards increasing x-coordinate.\n- There's a food item at the same position as the snake's head: (6,4). However, according to the rules:\n  - Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n    1. The body moves away, and\n    2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n  - Since the snake's body is just the head, moving away would mean the head moves to a new position, leaving (6,4), but then the head cannot move back onto (6,4) in the same turn. So, the food at (6,4) cannot be eaten immediately.\n  \n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current head direction is \"R\", the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R):** (x+1, y) → (7,4)\n  - Check if (7,4) is a wall: x=7 is a border wall → cannot move here.\n- **Up (U):** (x, y+1) → (6,5)\n  - Check walls: y=5 is not a border (border is y=7), and (6,5) is not in the internal obstacles list → valid.\n- **Down (D):** (x, y-1) → (6,3)\n  - Check walls: y=3 is not a border, and (6,3) is not in internal obstacles → valid.\n- **Left (L):** (x-1, y) → (5,4)\n  - Check walls: x=5 is not a border, and (5,4) is not in internal obstacles → valid.\n  \nHowever, there's a rule about **no instant reverse**:\n- Current direction is \"R\", so the opposite direction is \"L\".\n- Therefore, the snake cannot move Left (\"L\") in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves excluding \"L\":\n- Up (\"U\"): (6,5)\n- Down (\"D\"): (6,3)\n  \n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves based on food positions and potential future moves.\n\n**Option 1: Up (\"U\") to (6,5)**\n- New head position: (6,5)\n- Check for food at (6,5): No food listed here.\n- Next possible moves from (6,5):\n  - Current direction would be \"U\", so cannot move \"D\" next.\n  - Possible: \"U\", \"L\", \"R\"\n    - \"U\": (6,6) → check walls: y=6 is not border, internal obstacles: (3,6), (4,6) are not (6,6) → valid.\n    - \"L\": (5,5) → no walls → valid.\n    - \"R\": (7,5) → x=7 is border → invalid.\n  \n**Option 2: Down (\"D\") to (6,3)**\n- New head position: (6,3)\n- Check for food at (6,3): No food listed here.\n- Next possible moves from (6,3):\n  - Current direction would be \"D\", so cannot move \"U\" next.\n  - Possible: \"D\", \"L\", \"R\"\n    - \"D\": (6,2) → check walls: y=2 is not border, internal obstacles: (3,2), (2,2) are not (6,2) → valid.\n      - Also, there's food at (6,2) with value +1. If we move to (6,2) next, we can eat it.\n    - \"L\": (5,3) → no walls → valid.\n    - \"R\": (7,3) → x=7 is border → invalid.\n\n**Comparing the two options:**\n- Moving \"U\" to (6,5) doesn't immediately lead to food, and the next moves are open but no immediate food.\n- Moving \"D\" to (6,3) allows the possibility to move to (6,2) next to eat the food there.\n\n**Food at (6,2):**\n- Value: +1\n- Life span: 7\n- Current turn: 4, so it will disappear at turn 4 + 7 = turn 11.\n- We can reach it by:\n  - Turn 4: \"D\" to (6,3)\n  - Turn 5: \"D\" to (6,2) → eat food, length becomes 2.\n\nThis seems like a good plan because:\n- We're moving towards food that won't disappear soon (life span 7).\n- No immediate danger in moving \"D\" to (6,3).\n  \n**Alternative Consideration: Other Foods**\n- (2,4): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- (1,3): Also far.\n- (4,1): Far.\n- (6,4): Cannot be eaten now as explained earlier.\n  \nThus, moving towards (6,2) seems optimal.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nSince the snake is length 1, there's no body to collide with. The only dangers are walls and the no-reverse rule, which we've already considered.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween \"U\" and \"D\", \"D\" leads us closer to the food at (6,2), which is the most accessible positive food. Therefore, the best immediate action is to move Down (\"D\").\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Information**:\n   - Snake positions: [(6, 3)]. This means the snake is only 1 segment long (just the head at (6,3)).\n   - Current direction: D (Down). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - There are five food items on the grid, each with their position, life span, and value.\n     - (2,4): value=1, life_span=5\n     - (1,3): value=1, life_span=5\n     - (4,1): value=1, life_span=5\n     - (6,2): value=1, life_span=6\n     - (6,4): value=1, life_span=9\n   - All food items are positive (value=1), and none are under the snake's body (since the snake is only at (6,3)).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is D (Down), the snake cannot move U (Up) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n   - Allowed moves: D, L, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an obstacle.\n   - Current position: (6,3)\n   - Possible moves from (6,3):\n     - D: (6,2) - Check if this is valid:\n       - y=2 is not a border wall (y=0 is).\n       - (6,2) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n       - There is food at (6,2), but we'll consider that later.\n     - L: (5,3) - Check:\n       - x=5 is not a border wall.\n       - (5,3) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - R: (7,3) - Check:\n       - x=7 is a border wall → cannot move here.\n     - U: (6,4) - Opposite direction, but also let's check:\n       - Even if not opposite, y=4 is not a border wall.\n       - (6,4) is not an internal obstacle.\n       - But since current direction is D, U is opposite → cannot move U.\n\n   So, valid moves are D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves: D and L\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two possible moves: D (Down to (6,2)) and L (Left to (5,3)).\n\n1. **Move D to (6,2)**:\n   - (6,2) has food with value=1, life_span=6.\n   - Eating food:\n     - Length increases by 1: new positions [(6,2), (6,3)].\n     - Score increases by 1.\n     - Check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - After eating, the tail is at (6,3), and the head is at (6,2).\n       - Adjacent cells to head (6,2):\n         - U: (6,3) - tail is here, and it has positive food? Wait, no, the food is at (6,2), which is now the head. The tail is at (6,3), which does not have food (food was at (6,2)).\n       - So no danger here.\n   - No collision with walls or obstacles.\n   - This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Move L to (5,3)**:\n   - (5,3) does not have any food (from the given list).\n   - New positions: [(5,3), (6,3)] (since length increases only if food is eaten, but no food here, so length remains 1? Wait, no: the snake is length 1 now, moving without eating means length stays 1, so new position is just [(5,3)].\n     - Wait, the initial length is 1 (only head). Moving without eating means the tail doesn't grow, so the new position is just [(5,3)].\n     - But the rules say \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, implying normally length doesn't change unless eating.\n     - So moving to (5,3) without food: new position is [(5,3)].\n   - No collision risks.\n   - But no score gain either.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Move D: gain +1 score, length increases to 2, no immediate risks.\n- Move L: no gain, length remains 1.\n\nBetween these, Move D is clearly better as it increases the score without introducing immediate risks.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other rules or considerations we might have missed?\n\n1. **Food under body**: Not applicable here since the snake is length 1.\n2. **Life span of food**: All foods have life spans >=5, and current turn is 5, so none disappear this turn.\n3. **Future moves**: As a non-thinking executor, we don't plan ahead, but we can note that after moving D, the next moves will have to consider the longer body.\n\n### Potential Risks with Move D\n\nAfter moving D to (6,2), the snake will be at [(6,2), (6,3)].\nNext turn, if we move back to (6,3), that would be a body collision (head at (6,3), body at (6,3) - but the tail would have moved away? Wait, no: if we move from [(6,2), (6,3)] in direction U to (6,3), the body is at (6,3), but the tail moves from (6,3) to ... where? The tail was at (6,3), and the head moves to (6,3), so the tail would have to move away, but since length is 2, the tail moves to where the head was, which is (6,2). So new positions would be [(6,3), (6,2)], which is safe. So moving U after D is safe.\n\nBut since we're only deciding the immediate move, this is not a concern now.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any other food that is reachable in one move that we missed? The other foods are at (2,4), (1,3), (4,1), (6,4). None of these are adjacent to (6,3) except (6,4), but we cannot move U (opposite direction). So D and L are the only possible moves, and D is better.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two valid moves (D and L), moving D to (6,2) is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat positive food without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 6 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls): \n     - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n     - These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3)] \n     - Head is at (6,2), body segment at (6,3).\n   - Current head direction: D (Down). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Each food is given as (x, y, life_span, value).\n   - Positive foods (value = +1):\n     - (2,4,4,1)\n     - (1,3,4,1)\n     - (4,1,4,1)\n     - (6,4,8,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) and direction D (Down), the possible moves are U (Up), L (Left), R (Right). We cannot move D again because that would be an instant reverse (from D to D is allowed, but from D to U is not allowed because U is the opposite of D).\n\nWait, no: the rule says \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\". The opposite of D is U. So possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nBut the snake is currently moving D. So next move can be D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n1. **Move D (Down)**:\n   - Current head: (6,2)\n   - Move D: (6,1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: \n       - Border walls: y=0 is a wall, y=1 is not.\n       - Internal walls: (6,1) is not in the list.\n     - Not a body segment: Body is at (6,3), so no collision.\n   - Food at (6,1)? No, no food there.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move L (Left)**:\n   - Current head: (6,2)\n   - Move L: (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: \n       - x=5 is not a border wall.\n       - Internal walls: (5,2) is not listed.\n     - Not a body segment: Body is at (6,3), no collision.\n   - Food at (5,2)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no food.\n\n3. **Move R (Right)**:\n   - Current head: (6,2)\n   - Move R: (7,2)\n   - Check if (7,2) is valid:\n     - x=7 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves are D and L, neither leads to food.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nLet's see where the foods are and if we can plan to reach them:\n\n1. (2,4,4,1): At (2,4), life span 4, value +1.\n   - Distance from (6,2): Manhattan distance is |6-2| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n   - Life span is 4, so it will disappear in 4 turns (including current turn). So it's not reachable in time (need at least 6 moves, but disappears in 4).\n\n2. (1,3,4,1): At (1,3), life span 4, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-1| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n   - Life span 4: also not reachable in time.\n\n3. (4,1,4,1): At (4,1), life span 4, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Life span 4: can reach in 3 moves (current turn + 2 more), so it will be there when we arrive.\n   - Path to (4,1):\n     - Current: (6,2)\n     - Next move: To minimize distance, probably move left first.\n     - Move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1), then L to (4,1).\n     - Or move D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1).\n     - Both paths take 3 moves.\n   - So, we can aim for this food.\n\n4. (6,4,8,1): At (6,4), life span 8, value +1.\n   - Distance: |6-6| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n   - Life span 8: plenty of time.\n   - But currently, the body is at (6,3), so the food is under the body.\n   - To eat it:\n     - Need to move the body away first, then move head onto it.\n     - Currently, body is at (6,3), head at (6,2).\n     - If we move D to (6,1), body moves to (6,2).\n     - Then next turn, move U to (6,2), but body is now at (6,2), so head would collide with body.\n     - Not safe to eat this food now.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action is to start moving towards the reachable positive food at (4,1). \n\nFrom (6,2), to reach (4,1), the shortest path is to move left first (to (5,2)), then down (to (5,1)), then left (to (4,1)).\n\nSo, first move should be L (Left) to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving D first to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1) is also valid. \n\nBut moving L first seems more straightforward as it starts reducing the x-distance immediately.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore deciding, let's ensure that moving L to (5,2) is safe:\n- (5,2) is not a wall or body.\n- Next possible moves from (5,2):\n  - Current direction would be L (since we moved L).\n  - Possible next moves: L (to (4,2)), R (opposite, not allowed), U/D.\n  - From (5,2), moving D to (5,1) is safe, then L to (4,1).\n\nNo immediate dangers seen.\n\n### Considering the Other Food Under Body\n\nThe food at (6,4) is under the body at (6,3). To eat it:\n- First move body away by moving head away from body.\n- Current body is at (6,3), head at (6,2).\n- Moving D to (6,1) moves body to (6,2).\n- Then next turn, move U to (6,2) to eat food at (6,4), but this would collide head with body at (6,2).\n- So, cannot safely eat this food now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to start moving towards the reachable positive food at (4,1) by moving Left to (5,2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, indicating an 8x8 grid (since coordinates range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at:\n   - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n   \n   These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n3. **Snake Position**: \n   - Head at (5,2)\n   - Body segment at (6,2)\n   - Length = 2 (only head and one body segment)\n   - Current direction: Left (L)\n\n4. **Food Items**: \n   - (2,4): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (1,3): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (4,1): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (6,4): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (6,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n   All food is positive (value > 0), but some have very short life spans (1 turn), meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (5,2) with Direction L\n\nFrom the current direction (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R). So possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,3)\n- Down (D): (5,1)\n- Left (L): (4,2)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (4,2)\n- Check if (4,2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: \n    - Border walls are x=0,7; y=0,7 → (4,2) is within bounds.\n    - Internal walls: (3,2), (2,2) are walls, but (4,2) is not listed.\n  - Not body: Current body is at (6,2), so no collision.\n  \n  Valid move.\n\n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n  \n  So, this is a safe move but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,3)\n- Check (5,3):\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal walls: None at (5,3).\n  - Not body: Body is at (6,2), no collision.\n  \n  Valid move.\n\n- Food at (5,3)? No food listed.\n\nSafe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n- Check (5,1):\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal walls: (3,1) is a wall, but (5,1) is not listed.\n  - Not body: Body is at (6,2), no collision.\n  \n  Valid move.\n\n- Food at (5,1)? No food listed.\n\nSafe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nAll food has life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn unless eaten now. So, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (5,2):\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,2):\n- Up (5,3): No food.\n- Down (5,1): No food.\n- Left (4,2): No food.\n- Right (6,2): Body segment is here, but no food listed at (6,2).\n\nWait, the food positions are:\n- (2,4), (1,3), (4,1), (6,4), (6,1)\n\nNone are adjacent to (5,2). The closest is (6,1) and (6,4), but:\n- (6,1) is two moves away (right then down or down then right).\n- (6,4) is two moves away (right then up or up then right).\n\nSince we can't reach any food in one move, we can't eat any this turn. Thus, the priority is to move safely towards potential food in future turns.\n\n### Potential Strategies\n\nGiven that food is scarce and all will disappear next turn, the immediate goal is to position the snake to be near where new food might spawn or to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the current position:\n- Head at (5,2), body at (6,2).\n- Moving left to (4,2) seems safe and opens up more space.\n- Moving up or down also safe but doesn't seem advantageous.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (6,2). Is there food at (6,2)? No, so no danger of eating tail food.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible and all moves are safe, the best is to continue left to (4,2), which moves the snake towards the center where more food opportunities might arise.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L). Opposite is Right (R), which is not allowed next. But we're not choosing R, so it's fine.\n\n### Final Choice\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Left (L) to (3,2)\n\n- **Check for Walls**: (3,2) is listed as an internal obstacle. **Cannot move here**.\n  \n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,3)\n\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: y=7 is the upper border, but y=3 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,3) is not listed as a wall. **Safe**.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: The snake's body is at (5,2). (4,3) is not part of the body. **Safe**.\n- **Check for Food**: \n  - Is (4,3) a food position? Looking at the food list: no. **No food here**.\n  \n**Potential Move**: U\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,1)\n\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: y=0 is the lower border, but y=1 is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is listed as an internal obstacle. **Cannot move here**.\n\n### Evaluating the Only Viable Move: Up (U) to (4,3)\n\nSince moving Left and Down are blocked by walls, the only possible move is Up to (4,3).\n\n**Additional Checks**:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: \n  - The tail is at (5,2). The head is currently at (4,2), so the tail is adjacent (right side).\n  - Is there positive food at the tail's current position (5,2)? Checking the food list: no food is at (5,2). So, no danger from tail reward.\n  \n- **Future Implications**:\n  - Moving Up doesn't immediately lead to food, but it keeps the snake alive.\n  - The next move from (4,3) would have more options unless new obstacles or food appear.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nWhile moving Up doesn't eat any food, let's see if any food is reachable soon to prioritize:\n\n1. **(2,4)**: \n   - Current head at (4,2). To reach (2,4), need to go Left twice and Up twice. Not immediately accessible.\n2. **(1,3)**: \n   - Similar to (2,4), not immediately accessible.\n3. **(4,1)**: \n   - Blocked by a wall.\n4. **(6,4)**: \n   - Opposite direction from current Left movement; would require reversing.\n5. **(6,1)**: \n   - Also opposite direction and blocked by walls if trying to go down.\n\nNo immediate food is accessible in the next move, so survival is the priority.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any other consideration that might make another move viable?\n\n- **Instant Reverse**: Cannot move Right (from Left).\n- **Other Directions**: Only Up is viable; Left and Down are blocked.\n  \nThus, **Up (U)** is the only safe move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the only safe and legal move is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Thus, it cannot be eaten this turn.\n- The food at (1, 3) is reachable in 2 moves (L then L), but its life span is also 1, so it cannot be eaten this turn.\n- The food at (6, 4) and (6, 1) have longer life spans but are farther away.\n\n### Best Action:\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, and all possible moves (U, L, R) are safe, we can choose any of them. However, moving towards the food at (6, 4) or (6, 1) might be a good long-term strategy, but this requires planning beyond the immediate turn. \n\nFor the immediate turn, since no food is reachable, we can choose a move that keeps the snake safe and doesn't box it in.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state provided:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: Entire rows or columns at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Specific cells that are walls: [(3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)].\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (5, 3), body segment at (4, 3).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Four food items with their positions, values, and life spans:\n     - (1, 3): value=1, life_span=1\n     - (6, 4): value=5, life_span=1\n     - (6, 1): value=7, life_span=1\n     - (1, 5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next turn. So, possible immediate actions are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (5+1, 3) = (6, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a wall, but x=6 is not a border wall. Check internal obstacles: (6,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - **Body**: Current body is at (4,3). New head at (6,3) doesn't collide with body.\n- **Food**: No food at (6,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (5, 3+1) = (5, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is a wall, y=4 is not a border. Check internal obstacles: (5,4) is not listed.\n  - **Body**: No body at (5,4).\n- **Food**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (5, 3-1) = (5, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is a wall, y=2 is not a border. Check internal obstacles: (5,2) is not listed.\n  - **Body**: No body at (5,2).\n- **Food**: No food at (5,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move or if moving in a certain direction sets up for future food collection.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n1. (1,3): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Distance from head (5,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 (Manhattan distance)\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (6,4): value=5, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Can reach in two moves (e.g., Right then Up, or Up then Right).\n3. (6,1): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n4. (1,5): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nGiven that all food has life_span=1, they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. However, none are adjacent to the head to be eaten in the next move. \n\nBut wait, the food at (6,4) is two moves away, but since life_span=1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning we cannot reach it in time to eat it. Similarly for others.\n\nThis suggests that none of the current food can be eaten in the next move, and they will all disappear after this turn.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food can be eaten now, the priority is to position the snake for potential future food spawns while avoiding getting trapped.\n\nCurrent snake length is 2 (head and one body segment). The tail is at (4,3). \n\nIf we move Right to (6,3), the tail moves to (5,3), leaving (4,3) empty. \n\nIf we move Up to (5,4), tail moves to (5,3), leaving (4,3) empty.\n\nIf we move Down to (5,2), tail moves to (5,3), leaving (4,3) empty.\n\nAll moves are safe in terms of immediate collisions. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. \n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,3). Adjacent cells to the head (5,3) are:\n- Left: (4,3) - tail\n- Right: (6,3)\n- Up: (5,4)\n- Down: (5,2)\n\nThe tail is adjacent to the head at (4,3), but there is no food at (4,3), so no danger from this rule.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince all moves are safe and no food can be eaten this turn, the choice is arbitrary in terms of immediate rewards. However, moving Right keeps the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to change.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up or Down could be better for exploring more of the grid, but without knowing future food spawns, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that moving Right is safe and maintains direction, and other moves don't offer immediate benefits, moving Right seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, looking at the internal obstacles, moving Right to (6,3) is safe, but then next moves could be limited if walls are nearby. \n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- Moving Right to (6,3):\n  - Next possible moves: Up to (6,4) or Down to (6,2) or Right to (7,3) but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move Right next.\n  - (6,4): is it a wall? Internal obstacles: (4,5), (3,6), (4,6) - (6,4) is not listed, so safe.\n  - (6,2): not listed as obstacle, safe.\n\nMoving Up to (5,4):\n  - Next possible moves: Left to (4,4), Right to (6,4), Up to (5,5), Down to (5,3) (but would reverse to current head position, not allowed).\n  - (4,4): not an obstacle.\n  - (6,4): not an obstacle.\n  - (5,5): not an obstacle.\n\nMoving Down to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves: Left to (4,2), Right to (6,2), Down to (5,1), Up to (5,3) (reverse, not allowed).\n  - (4,2): not an obstacle.\n  - (6,2): not an obstacle.\n  - (5,1): not an obstacle (but (3,1) is an obstacle, but (5,1) is not).\n\nAll options seem similarly safe. \n\nGiven that, and since no food is immediately accessible, moving Right maintains direction and is a safe choice.\n\n### Verifying No Better Option\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten in two moves? For example, if we move Right to (6,3), then next turn can we eat any food that might spawn?\n\nBut since food spawns are not predictable, and current food will disappear, this is not a consideration.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards the center might be better to avoid getting trapped near walls. Current head is at (5,3), which is already central. Moving Right to (6,3) is slightly towards the right wall, but not immediately dangerous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving Right is a safe and reasonable choice given the current state.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information to understand the current state of the game:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake consists of two segments:\n     - Head at (6, 3)\n     - Body segment at (5, 3)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food are present:\n     - (6, 4): value = +1, life_span = 5\n     - (6, 1): value = +1, life_span = 6\n     - (1, 5): value = +1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the snake cannot immediately move Left (L) in the next turn.\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by a wall or an internal obstacle.\n3. **Body Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by its own body, except for the tail segment, which will move away in the same turn.\n\nGiven the current head position at (6, 3) and direction R, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Right (R)\n- New head position: (6 + 1, 3) = (7, 3)\n- Check:\n  - Border wall at x=7: This is a wall, so moving Right would cause a collision. **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Up (U)\n- New head position: (6, 3 + 1) = (6, 4)\n- Check:\n  - Is (6,4) a wall or obstacle? \n    - Border walls: y=7 is the upper border, y=4 is within bounds.\n    - Internal obstacles: (6,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - Is (6,4) occupied by the snake's body?\n    - Current body segments: (5,3). (6,4) is not part of the body.\n  - Food at (6,4): Yes, there is positive food here with value +1.\n    - Check Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (5,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail before moving?\n      - Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right). (6,3) and (5,3) are adjacent (left-right).\n      - After moving to (6,4), the tail will move from (5,3) to (6,3) (since the snake moves forward).\n      - New tail position: (6,3)\n      - New head position: (6,4)\n      - Are they adjacent? (6,4) and (6,3) are adjacent (up-down).\n      - The food at (6,4) is being eaten, so the snake grows by 1, meaning the tail does not move, and the new tail is the old tail (5,3).\n      - But the new head is at (6,4), and the new tail is at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (6,4) and (5,3) are diagonally adjacent, not sharing a side. So no immediate collision.\n      - Wait, let's clarify Tail Reward Danger:\n        - It occurs if the head is adjacent to the tail AND the tail cell has positive food.\n        - Before moving: head at (6,3), tail at (5,3). Adjacent.\n        - Tail cell (5,3): Is there food here? No, food is at (6,4), (6,1), (1,5).\n        - So no Tail Reward Danger in this case.\n  - Conclusion: Moving Up is valid and results in eating positive food.\n\n#### 3. Down (D)\n- New head position: (6, 3 - 1) = (6, 2)\n- Check:\n  - Is (6,2) a wall or obstacle?\n    - Border walls: y=0 is the lower border, y=2 is within bounds.\n    - Internal obstacles: (6,2) is not listed.\n  - Is (6,2) occupied by the snake's body?\n    - Current body: (5,3). (6,2) is not part of the body.\n  - Food at (6,2): No food listed here.\n  - No immediate collisions or dangers.\n  - Conclusion: Moving Down is valid but does not eat food.\n\n#### 4. Left (L)\n- New head position: (6 - 1, 3) = (5, 3)\n- Check:\n  - Is (5,3) a wall or obstacle?\n    - Not listed as a border or internal obstacle.\n  - Is (5,3) occupied by the snake's body?\n    - Current body segment is at (5,3). Moving here would mean the head collides with the body.\n    - However, the tail is at (5,3), and tails move forward when the snake moves, so this is allowed unless it causes a collision after the move.\n    - After moving left to (5,3), the tail would move from (5,3) to (6,3) (since the head was at (6,3)), but the head is now at (5,3), so the body becomes [(5,3), (6,3)].\n    - No immediate collision since the head is at (5,3) and the only body segment is at (6,3), which is adjacent but not overlapping.\n    - But is this allowed? Typically, moving into the tail's current position is allowed because the tail moves away, but here the tail is the only body segment.\n    - Need to check if this causes a collision after the move:\n      - New head: (5,3)\n      - New body: [(5,3), (6,3)] -> wait, no, the original body was [(6,3), (5,3)], moving left would make the head go to (5,3), and the body becomes [(5,3), (6,3)], but the tail was at (5,3), which is now the head, and the new tail is (6,3).\n      - So the new positions: head at (5,3), body at (6,3). They are adjacent but not overlapping, so no collision.\n    - Food at (5,3): No food here.\n  - However, the current direction is R, and moving L is the opposite direction, which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n  - Conclusion: Moving Left is invalid due to instant reverse rule.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nFrom the above, the valid moves are:\n- Up (U): Eats positive food at (6,4)\n- Down (D): No food\n- Right (R): Invalid (wall)\n- Left (L): Invalid (instant reverse)\n\nBetween Up and Down, Up is preferable because it allows the snake to eat positive food, increasing its length and score.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing Up, let's ensure there are no immediate dangers after this move:\n\n- After moving Up to (6,4):\n  - New snake positions: head at (6,4), body at (6,3)\n  - The tail was at (5,3), but since we ate food, the length increases by 1, so the tail does not move. New body is [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n    - Wait, no: original length is 2 (head and one body segment). After eating, length becomes 3. So the tail is not removed; the new body is [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n    - But the movement is such that the head moves to (6,4), the segment that was at (6,3) stays, and the segment that was at (5,3) stays, so the new body is [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n    - But the snake only grows by adding one new segment where the head was, so the tail doesn't move. Original: [(6,3), (5,3)]. After moving up: head to (6,4), add new segment at (6,3), keep (5,3), so [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n    - So length is now 3.\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4):\n    - Cannot reverse to Down (D) (current move is U, so next cannot be D).\n    - Need to ensure that from (6,4), the snake has safe moves to continue.\n\nLooking at the surroundings of (6,4):\n- Right (R): (7,4) - wall (x=7). Invalid.\n- Left (L): (5,4) - check:\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Not part of the body (body is at (6,3) and (5,3)).\n  - No food there.\n- Up (U): (6,5) - check:\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Not part of the body.\n  - No food there.\n- Down (D): (6,3) - but this is part of the body. However, since the tail is at (5,3), and the body is [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)], moving down would put head at (6,3), which is the second segment. But the tail is at (5,3), which would move to (6,3) if the head moves to (6,3), causing a collision. So Down would be invalid next turn.\n\nSo after moving Up, the next move options are Left or Up, which are safe.\n\n### Alternative Move: Down\n\nFor completeness, let's consider moving Down to (6,2):\n\n- New snake positions: head at (6,2), body at (6,3) (tail moves from (5,3) to (6,3)).\n- Length remains 2 (no food eaten).\n- Next possible moves from (6,2):\n  - Cannot reverse to Up (U).\n  - Left (L): (5,2) - check:\n    - Not a wall or obstacle.\n    - Not part of the body (body is at (6,3)).\n    - No food there.\n  - Right (R): (7,2) - wall. Invalid.\n  - Down (D): (6,1) - check:\n    - Not a wall or obstacle.\n    - Not part of the body.\n    - Food at (6,1): value +1, life_span 6.\n    - Check Tail Reward Danger:\n      - Current head at (6,2), tail at (6,3). Adjacent? (6,2) and (6,3) are adjacent.\n      - Tail cell (6,3): No food here.\n      - So no danger.\n    - Eating this food would grow the snake to length 3.\n\nMoving Down now doesn't eat food, but next move could eat at (6,1). However, moving Up now allows eating immediately, which is better for score maximization.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (6,4), increasing the score and length safely without immediate dangers in the next moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 12.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n     - These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,4), then (6,3), then (5,3).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,1): value = +1, life_span = 5\n   - (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,4) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6,5)\n- **Left (L)**: (5,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (7,4) — but x=7 is a border wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Down (\"D\") because that's the opposite of current direction (\"U\"), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, valid moves: U or L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (6,5)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,5) is not a wall (x=6, y=5 is within borders, and not in internal obstacles).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (6,3) and (5,3). (6,5) is not in the body.\n- Food at (6,5)? No, food is at (6,1) and (1,5).\n- Next head position: (6,5)\n  - Adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,3). Distance from (6,5) to (5,3) is more than 1, so no adjacency.\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5,4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is at (6,3) and (5,3). (5,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (5,4)? No.\n- Next head position: (5,4)\n  - Adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,3). Yes, adjacent (directly below).\n  - Is there positive food at tail (5,3)? No, food is at (6,1) and (1,5).\n  - So, no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nBoth moves are safe with no immediate reward. Now, let's think about future possibilities:\n\n- **Move Up (6,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (6,5): Up (6,6), Left (5,5), Right (7,5) — but Right is wall.\n  - (6,6): not wall, not body (current body will move to (6,4), (6,3), tail (5,3) disappears).\n  - (5,5): not wall, not body.\n  - From (6,5), can potentially move towards food at (1,5) by going left.\n\n- **Move Left (5,4)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,4): Up (5,5), Down (5,3), Left (4,4).\n  - Down (5,3): current tail is at (5,3), but tail will move to (6,3), so (5,3) is empty — but moving down would reverse direction from initial left, which might not be allowed if next direction is considered from current move.\n  - Up (5,5): towards food at (1,5).\n  - Left (4,4): no immediate benefit.\n\n**Food Considerations**:\n- Food at (6,1): life_span = 5, current turn = 12, so disappears at turn 17. It's below the current head, but moving down is not possible now.\n- Food at (1,5): life_span = 8, disappears at turn 20. It's to the left and up.\n\nMoving left now to (5,4) can set up a path towards (1,5) by subsequent left and up moves.\n\nMoving up to (6,5) also allows moving left towards (1,5), but is slightly further away.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nLooking at the internal obstacles:\n- Moving left to (5,4) is safe, and from there can go up to (5,5), then left towards food.\n- Moving up to (6,5) is also safe, but may take longer to reach food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth moves are safe, but moving left seems slightly better for positioning towards the food at (1,5).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but:\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately (from Left to Right is not allowed).\n- So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (5,4)\n- New head position: (5-1,4) = (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,4) is not a wall (not in internal obstacles or borders).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (6,4) and (6,3). (4,4) is not in body.\n- Food at (4,4)? No food there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (5,4+1) = (5,5)\n- Check collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (5,5) is not in [(6,4), (6,3)].\n- Food at (5,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (5,4-1) = (5,3)\n- Check collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (5,3) is not in body segments.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **(6,1)**: value=1, life=4\n   - Distance from head (5,4): |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - To reach it in 4 turns (before it disappears), need to move towards it.\n   - Current move options don't directly help reach it quickly.\n\n2. **(1,5)**: value=1, life=7\n   - Distance: |1-5| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n   - Life span is 7, so can reach it if we start moving towards it.\n\n3. **(5,4)**: value=1, life=10\n   - This is currently under the snake's head!\n   - Special rule: can only eat if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n   - Currently, head is on (5,4), so can't eat it now unless we move away and then back.\n   - Not immediately useful.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten:\n- Tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4)\n- Food at these positions? No, closest is (6,1), not adjacent.\n- No immediate danger here.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe with no immediate food to eat. So, we should choose the move that positions us best for future food collection.\n\n- **(6,1)**: To reach it, need to go left then down (but left is already an option).\n- **(1,5)**: To reach it, need to go up then left multiple times.\n\nBetween U and D:\n- Moving Up (U) to (5,5) gets us closer to (1,5).\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,3) doesn't help much with current foods.\n- Moving Left (L) to (4,4) is neutral.\n\nBest seems to be Up, heading towards (1,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nWait, there's food at (5,4) under the head. Can we eat it?\n- Rule: can only eat if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n- Currently, head is on (5,4), body is at (6,4), (6,3).\n- If we move Left to (4,4), body moves to (5,4), (6,4). Then next turn, if we move Right back to (5,4), body would be at (4,4), (5,4), and head at (5,4) - but then the new tail would be at (5,4), same as head, causing collision.\n- So eating this food is dangerous (\"Tail Reward Danger\").\n- Better to avoid trying to eat (5,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate move is **Up (U)**, heading towards (1,5) while avoiding any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 14  \n**Walls**:  \n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))  \n- Internal obstacles:  \n  (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \n- Head: (5,5)  \n- Body: [(5,4), (6,4)]  \nSo the snake is 3 segments long: head at (5,5), then (5,4), then tail at (6,4).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, meaning last move was upwards, so from (5,4) to (5,5)).\n\n**Food**:  \n1. (6,1), value=1, life_span=3  \n2. (1,5), value=1, life_span=6  \n3. (5,4), value=1, life_span=9  \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,5), possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But we have to consider:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Last move was U (from (5,4) to (5,5)), so we cannot move D (down) next, as that would reverse the direction instantly.\n   - So, cannot move D.\n\n2. **Wall and obstacle collisions**:  \n   - U (Up): (5,5) → (5,6)  \n     - Check if (5,6) is a wall or obstacle:  \n       - Border walls: y=7 is top, so y=6 is okay.  \n       - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is not in the list.  \n     - Also, check if (5,6) is part of the snake's body:  \n       - Snake body is at (5,4) and (6,4), so no.  \n     - So, U is possible.\n\n   - L (Left): (5,5) → (4,5)  \n     - Check (4,5):  \n       - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is in the list! So cannot move L.\n\n   - R (Right): (5,5) → (6,5)  \n     - Check (6,5):  \n       - Border walls: x=7 is right, so x=6 is okay.  \n       - Internal obstacles: (6,5) is not listed.  \n       - Snake body: not on body.  \n     - So, R is possible.\n\nSo possible moves: U, R.\n\n### Checking Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving U or R can eat any food.\n\n**Food at (6,1)**:  \n- Current head is at (5,5). Moving U to (5,6) or R to (6,5) doesn't reach (6,1).  \n- So, no immediate eating from this food.\n\n**Food at (1,5)**:  \n- Similarly, far away from current head position.\n\n**Food at (5,4)**:  \n- This is interesting. (5,4) is the first body segment right after the head.  \n- According to the rules, food under the body can be eaten if:  \n  1. The body moves away, and  \n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.  \n\nCurrently, the body is at (5,4) and (6,4). If we move the head, the body will follow:\n\n- If head moves from (5,5) to (5,6), body becomes [(5,5), (5,4)] (tail at (5,4)).  \n  - Then, food at (5,4) is under the tail. Next move, if we move head to (5,4), we can eat it, but:  \n    - **Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the newly grown tail will collide with the head.  \n    - After moving U to (5,6), next move head is at (5,6), tail at (5,4). They are not adjacent (distance is 2), so no immediate danger, but planning to eat (5,4) later might be risky if we get adjacent.\n\n- If head moves from (5,5) to (6,5), body becomes [(6,5), (5,4)], tail at (6,4).  \n  - Then, food at (5,4) is under the second body segment.  \n  - Next move, if we move towards (5,4), we'd have to see if it's safe.\n\nBut for the immediate move, moving U or R doesn't directly eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move U to (5,6)**  \n- Pros:  \n  - Moves away from the body, opening space.  \n  - Doesn't immediately risk colliding with anything.  \n- Cons:  \n  - Not moving towards any visible food.  \n\n**Option 2: Move R to (6,5)**  \n- Pros:  \n  - Moves towards the center, possibly more options next move.  \n- Cons:  \n  - Not directly beneficial for food.  \n\nBetween U and R, both seem safe. Moving U might be slightly better because it moves away from the body segment at (5,4), giving more space to maneuver later, especially since there's food at (5,4) that we might want to eat later (but carefully to avoid tail collision).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving U or R?\n\n- Moving U to (5,6):  \n  - Next possible moves from (5,6):  \n    - Cannot move D (reverse).  \n    - Can move U to (5,7), but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.  \n    - Can move L to (4,6): check (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so no.  \n    - Can move R to (6,6): no walls or obstacles.  \n  - So from (5,6), only R is possible next move (to (6,6)).  \n\n- Moving R to (6,5):  \n  - Next possible moves from (6,5):  \n    - Cannot move L (reverse).  \n    - Can move U to (6,6): okay.  \n    - Can move D to (6,4): but tail is at (6,4), which will move away, so safe.  \n    - Can move R to (7,5): x=7 is wall, so no.  \n  - So from (6,5), can move U or D next.  \n\nMoving R gives more options next move (U or D), whereas moving U only allows R next. So R might be better for flexibility.\n\n### Re-evaluating Based on Flexibility\n\nGiven that moving R to (6,5) gives more options next move (U or D), whereas moving U to (5,6) restricts next move to only R, moving R seems better to maintain flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving **Right (R)** to (6,5) seems the better choice as it maintains more flexibility for future moves without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and some internal obstacles.\n   \n2. **Snake Position**:\n   - Head: (6, 5)\n   - Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4)]\n   - Current direction: Right (R)\n\n   So, the snake is moving to the right, with its head at (6,5), followed by the body at (5,5) and tail at (5,4).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (6, 1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (1, 5): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (5, 4): value=1, life_span=8\n\n   All foods are positive (value=1), and their life spans indicate how many turns they'll remain on the grid.\n\n4. **Internal Obstacles (Walls)**:\n   - (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the snake is currently moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (6, 6)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (6, 4)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (7, 5)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (Right), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a border wall → **Collision with wall** → **Invalid move**\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (6,6)\n- Check for walls: \n  - (6,6) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - y=7 is a wall, but (6,6) is one step below it → no immediate wall collision.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body is at (5,5) and (5,4) → (6,6) is not part of the body → **No collision**\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (6,6) → just move.\n  \nThis move seems safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (6,4)\n- Check for walls:\n  - (6,4) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - y=0 is a wall, but (6,4) is above it → no immediate wall collision.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Body is at (5,5) and (5,4) → (6,4) is not part of the body → **No collision**\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (6,4) → just move.\n\nThis move also seems safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next move or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |5-1| = 4 steps vertically.\n   - Life span: 2 turns → will disappear after turn 17.\n   - Not reachable in one move, but moving down could be a step towards it.\n\n2. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Distance: |6-1| = 5 steps horizontally.\n   - Life span: 5 turns → disappears after turn 20.\n   - Moving left would be towards it, but we can't move left this turn.\n\n3. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - Current position: tail is at (5,4), and this is also a food position.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: \n     - The head is at (6,5), tail at (5,4). Are they adjacent?\n     - Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right). \n     - (6,5) and (5,4) are diagonally adjacent (not directly adjacent) → no immediate danger.\n     - However, the food is under the tail. To eat it:\n       - The tail must move away (which it will if the snake moves).\n       - Then, the head must move onto (5,4).\n     - Currently, moving down to (6,4) doesn't help in eating (5,4).\n     - To eat (5,4), the snake would need to move left to (5,5), but that's the body segment → collision.\n     - Alternatively, next turn after moving down to (6,4), then left to (5,4) could eat it, but:\n       - After moving down to (6,4), the body becomes [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? Wait, no:\n         - Original: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n         - Move down: head to (6,4), body follows: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] → tail is at (5,5)\n         - Then next move left to (5,4): \n           - Head moves to (5,4), which is where the tail was, but tail is now at (5,5), so no collision.\n           - But the food was at (5,4), which is now (5,5)? Wait, food positions are fixed unless eaten or expired.\n           - Original food at (5,4) is still there unless eaten or expired.\n           - So moving left to (5,4) would eat it, but need to check if it's safe:\n             - After move down to (6,4), then left to (5,4):\n               - New body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] → tail is at (6,5)\n               - No collision.\n               - But is the food still there? Its life span is 8, so at turn 16, it's still there.\n               - So this seems possible, but requires two moves.\n     - However, the current task is to decide the immediate action at turn 15, not plan ahead.\n\nGiven that, neither moving up nor down directly eats any food this turn. \n\n### Choosing Between Up and Down\n\nBoth Up to (6,6) and Down to (6,4) are safe. Now, let's see which is better strategically:\n\n1. **Moving Up (6,6)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,6), direction U:\n     - Can't move D (opposite).\n     - Can move U (6,7) → but y=7 is wall → invalid.\n     - Can move L (5,6) or R (7,6):\n       - R (7,6): x=7 is wall → invalid.\n       - L (5,6): \n         - Check walls: not listed as internal obstacle.\n         - Body would be [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)] → no collision.\n   - Moving up seems to keep options open but doesn't directly approach any food.\n\n2. **Moving Down (6,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,4), direction D:\n     - Can't move U (opposite).\n     - Can move D (6,3), L (5,4), R (7,4):\n       - D (6,3): \n         - Not a wall.\n         - Body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] → no collision.\n       - L (5,4):\n         - Food at (5,4) could be eaten next turn as described above.\n       - R (7,4): x=7 is wall → invalid.\n   - Moving down allows the possibility to eat the food at (5,4) next turn by moving left.\n\nGiven that moving down offers a potential to eat food next turn, whereas moving up doesn't offer immediate food prospects, **moving down seems slightly better**.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Eating\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately this turn? \n\n- Current head at (6,5), moving to:\n  - (6,6): no food.\n  - (6,4): no food.\n  - (7,5): wall → invalid.\n  \nNo immediate food to eat, so the choice is based on future possibilities.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any danger with the food at (5,4)?\n\n- Currently, head at (6,5), tail at (5,4).\n- They are diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (not sharing a side).\n- The rule states: \"If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n- Here, head is not directly adjacent to tail (no shared side), so no immediate danger.\n- Even if we move to eat (5,4) next turn, the tail would have moved, so no collision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate move at turn 15 is to move **Down (D)** to (6,4), setting up the potential to eat the food at (5,4) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn:** 16  \n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding walls)\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (6,4)\n- Body: [(6,5), (5,5)]\n  \nSo, the snake is three segments long: head at (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** D (Down, which is decreasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items:**\n1. (6,1) - value: 1, life_span: 1\n2. (1,5) - value: 1, life_span: 4\n3. (5,4) - value: 1, life_span: 7\n4. (2,1) - value: 1, life_span: 10\n\nAll foods are positive (value = +1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,4) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (6,3)\n- Left (L): (5,4)\n- Right (R): (7,4) → but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction D (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, valid moves: D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (D) to (6,3)**\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Body: Snake body is at (6,5) and (5,5). (6,3) is not in the body.\n- Walls: (6,3) is within the grid (x=6 is not a wall, y=3 is not a wall).\n- Obstacles: Check internal obstacles. (6,3) is not in the list.\n  \nSafe move.\n\nCheck for food:\n- Is there food at (6,3)? No, none of the food items are at (6,3).\n  \nSo, moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (5,4)**\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Body: Snake body is at (6,5) and (5,5). (5,4) is not in the body.\n- Walls: (5,4) is within the grid.\n- Obstacles: (5,4) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n  \nSafe move.\n\nCheck for food:\n- Food at (5,4): Yes, there's food at (5,4) with value 1, life_span 7.\n  \nEating this food:\n- The head moves to (5,4), which is food.\n- The body grows by one, so new positions: head at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5).\n  \nCheck for Tail Reward Danger:\n- After eating, the tail is at (5,5).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (5,4), tail at (5,5): yes, they are adjacent (up/down).\n- Is there positive food at the tail? Currently, no food is at (5,5). The food is at (5,4), which is being eaten.\n  \nWait, the Tail Reward Danger is if the head is adjacent to the tail AND the tail cell has positive food. Here, the tail is at (5,5), and there's no food at (5,5), so no danger.\n\nThus, eating (5,4) is safe and beneficial.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- Move D: safe, no food.\n- Move L: safe, eats positive food.\n\nClearly, moving L is better as it increases the score.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nJust to ensure we're not missing anything:\n- (6,1): life_span 1, so will disappear next turn (after this move). Currently at turn 16, so at turn 17 it's gone.\n- (1,5): life_span 4, so will disappear at turn 20.\n- (5,4): life_span 7, disappears at turn 23.\n- (2,1): life_span 10, disappears at turn 26.\n\nNo immediate urgency with other foods.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After L\n\nAfter moving L to (5,4), the snake will be:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n  \nDirection will be L (since we moved L).\n\nNext possible moves from (5,4), direction L:\n- Continue L: (4,4)\n- U: (5,5) → but (5,5) is the tail, which will move to (6,5) after this move, so it's safe.\n- D: (5,3) → opposite of U, but current direction is L, so D is allowed.\n\nBut we don't need to plan ahead, just noting that future moves seem flexible.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving L?\n- No collision.\n- Eating positive food safely.\n- No Tail Reward Danger.\n  \nAll good.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to eat the positive food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 17  \n**Walls**:\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are:\n1. Head at (5,4)\n2. Next segment at (6,4)\n3. Then (6,5)\n4. Tail at (5,5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1,5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n2. (2,1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next turn. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nNew head position: (5-1, 4) = (4,4)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: \n  - x=0 is a wall, but we're moving to x=4, which is fine.\n  - No internal obstacles at (4,4).\n- **Body**:\n  - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n  - (4,4) is not in the body, so no collision.\n  \nIs there food at (4,4)? \n- Food is at (1,5) and (2,1), so no.\n\nSo, moving Left is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nNew head position: (5,4+1) = (5,5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: \n  - y=7 is the upper wall, we're at y=5, fine.\n  - No internal obstacles at (5,5).\n- **Body**:\n  - Current tail is at (5,5). \n  - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, but we need to check if there's positive food at the tail that could cause a \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nIs there positive food at (5,5)?\n- Food is at (1,5) and (2,1), so no food at (5,5).\n  \nSo, moving Up is safe. \n\nBut let's see if it's beneficial:\n- No food at (5,5), so no score change.\n- The tail is at (5,5), and the head moves there, but since there's no food, the tail will move away, and the head takes its place, so no collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\nNew head position: (5,4-1) = (5,3)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: \n  - y=0 is the lower wall, we're at y=3, fine.\n  - Internal obstacles: check if (5,3) is in the list.\n    - Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n    - (5,3) is not in the list, so safe.\n- **Body**:\n  - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n  - (5,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n\nIs there food at (5,3)?\n- No, food is at (1,5) and (2,1).\n\nSo, moving Down is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLet's look at the food positions:\n\n1. (1,5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (5,4):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-1| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - To reach it in one move, we'd need to be adjacent, which we're not (distance is 5), so can't eat it this turn.\n\n2. (2,1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (5,4):\n     - |5-2| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Also can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, none of the food can be eaten this turn, regardless of the move.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in any move?\n- Moving Left: safe\n- Moving Up: safe (no food at tail)\n- Moving Down: safe\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the priority is to stay safe and possibly position ourselves to reach food next turn.\n\nCurrent head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's see where each move takes us and how it positions us for future moves.\n\n1. Left (L) to (4,4):\n   - Next possible moves from (4,4): U, D, L (can't go R, since current move is L)\n   - From (4,4), distance to (1,5) is |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Distance to (2,1) is |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Both foods will disappear after this turn, so not helpful.\n\n2. Up (U) to (5,5):\n   - Next possible moves from (5,5): U, D, L (can't go D, since current move is U)\n   - Distance to foods: both foods are too far and will disappear, so not helpful.\n\n3. Down (D) to (5,3):\n   - Next possible moves from (5,3): U, D, R (can't go U, since current move is D)\n   - Distance to foods: both will disappear, not helpful.\n\nSince all moves are safe and none can reach food this turn, we can choose any. \n\nBut let's think about future moves. Moving Left takes us to (4,4), which is closer to the center, possibly giving more options next turn. Moving Up or Down takes us towards edges where there are more walls and obstacles.\n\nMoving Left seems slightly better for future flexibility.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for Moving Up\n\nWait, moving Up to (5,5) where the tail is. Is there food at (5,5)? No, so no danger. But let's confirm:\n\nTail is at (5,5), head moves to (5,5), tail moves away (original tail was at (5,5), body was [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], so next tail will be at (6,5) after moving head to (5,5)).\n\nNo food at (5,5), so no danger.\n\nBut since no food is reachable, and all moves are safe, Left seems fine.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAll moves are safe, none can reach food this turn, so choose Left to maintain direction unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nIf we go Left to (4,4), body becomes [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], tail (6,5) moves away from (5,5).\n\nIf we go Up to (5,5), body becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], tail (6,5) moves away from (5,5).\n\nIf we go Down to (5,3), body becomes [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], tail (6,5) moves away from (5,5).\n\nNo immediate advantage to any, but Left keeps us moving in the same direction, which is generally good unless we need to turn to avoid something.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, moving Left is safe and maintains the current direction without any immediate risks or missed opportunities since no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

But we need to check if that's safe.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: (4,4) -> (3,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (3,4) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,2), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (4,5), (4,6) — (3,4) is not in this list.\n     - Body collision: The body is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (3,4) is not in these.\n   - Safe to move left.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: (4,4) -> (4,5)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,5) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is in the list! So this is an obstacle. Cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: (4,4) -> (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (4,3) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,3) is not listed.\n     - Body: Not in body segments.\n   - Safe to move down.\n\n4. **Reverse Right (R)**: (4,4) -> (5,4)\n   - But the snake was moving left, so right is the opposite direction. The rules say \"No instant reverse\", so this is not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid moves are Left (L) and Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Value: +3 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Distance from head (4,4):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - To reach (1,5) in one move, not possible. Need multiple moves.\n   - Given life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so cannot be eaten now.\n\n2. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Value: +8 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head (4,4):\n     - |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Also cannot be eaten in one move, and will disappear.\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten immediately, they don't influence the immediate move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (6,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5).\n- Head is at (4,4), which is not adjacent to (6,5). So this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Choosing Between Left and Down\n\nNow, between Left (L) and Down (D):\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (4,4) -> (3,4)\n   - Next possible moves from (3,4):\n     - Left: (2,4) — check walls/obstacles: (2,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n     - Up: (3,5) — (3,5) is not an obstacle.\n     - Down: (3,3) — not an obstacle.\n   - Opens up more options for future moves.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,4) -> (4,3)\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n     - Left: (3,3) — not an obstacle.\n     - Right: (5,3) — not an obstacle.\n     - Down: (4,2) — not an obstacle.\n   - Also opens up options, but let's see if one is better than the other.\n\nLooking at the grid, moving left seems safe and keeps the snake moving towards the center where there might be more space to maneuver in the future. Moving down also seems safe, but left might be slightly better as it's the current direction, and changing direction isn't necessary unless there's a benefit.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nNeither move leads directly to food, and both are safe. Since there's no immediate benefit to changing direction, it might be better to continue in the current direction (Left) to maintain simplicity unless there's a reason to turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Threats\n\n- Moving left to (3,4): no walls, no obstacles, no body collision.\n- Moving down to (4,3): same checks, also safe.\n\nSince both are safe and no food can be eaten this turn, the choice is neutral. Continuing left seems reasonable.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is to continue in the current direction (Left), as it maintains the snake's path without unnecessary turns when no immediate benefits are present.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what constraints we're working with.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)]. So, the head is at (3,4), followed by segments at (4,4), (5,4), and the tail at (6,4).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     - (1,5): value = 2, life_span = 1\n     - (2,1): value = 7, life_span = 1\n     - (1,2): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (no instant reverse rule). So, possible immediate moves are U, D, or continue L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (3,4)\n- New head position: (3-1,4) = (2,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is a wall, but we're moving to x=2, which is not a wall.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (2,2), (2,3), (2,5) are obstacles, but (2,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n  - **Body Collision**: The body segments are at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). (2,4) is not part of the body.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (2,4)? Looking at the food positions: (1,5), (2,1), (1,2) — no food at (2,4).\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (3,4+1) = (3,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the upper wall, but y=5 is fine.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,6), (3,1), (3,2) are obstacles, but (3,5) is not listed.\n  - **Body Collision**: (3,5) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3,5)? No, food is at (1,5), (2,1), (1,2).\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (3,4-1) = (3,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is the lower wall, but y=3 is fine.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) are obstacles, but (3,3) is not listed.\n  - **Body Collision**: (3,3) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (3,3)? No.\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to eating food. However, let's look at the food positions to see if we can plan a path towards them in future moves.\n\n1. **(1,5)**: value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - Current turn is 19, so it will disappear at turn 20 (since life_span decreases this turn).\n   - To reach (1,5) from (3,4):\n     - Need to move left twice: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4), then up to (1,5).\n     - But it will disappear at turn 20, and we're at turn 19. Even if we move left now to (2,4), next turn (turn 20) the food will be gone before we can reach it.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (1,5).\n\n2. **(2,1)**: value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Disappears at turn 20.\n   - From (3,4), path could be:\n     - Left to (2,4), then down to (2,3) — but (2,3) is an obstacle.\n     - Alternative: Left to (2,4), down to (2,3) is blocked, so not reachable in one move after left.\n   - Seems unreachable before it disappears.\n\n3. **(1,2)**: value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Disappears at turn 20.\n   - From (3,4):\n     - Left to (2,4), then left to (1,4), then down to (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n     - But it disappears at turn 20, so cannot reach in time.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (1,2).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nEven though we're not eating food now, let's check if any food is under the snake's body that could be dangerous if we move in a certain way.\n\n- Snake body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Food positions: (1,5), (2,1), (1,2) — none are under the snake's body.\n- So, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince none of the food is reachable before it disappears, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive. All three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe in terms of not hitting walls, obstacles, or the body.\n\nHowever, moving Left continues the current direction, which might be preferable to avoid unnecessary turns unless there's a reason to change direction. \n\nAlternatively, moving Up or Down could position the snake better for future food that might appear, but since we don't have information about future food spawns, it's hard to optimize for that.\n\nGiven that all moves are equally safe and no food is immediately accessible, continuing Left seems reasonable to maintain a straight path unless there's a strategic reason to turn.\n\n### Verifying Future Moves After Left\n\nIf we move Left to (2,4), next possible moves (assuming no new food appears):\n\n- Current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n- Possible: U, D, L.\n   - U: (2,5) — but (2,5) is an internal obstacle. Cannot move there.\n   - D: (2,3) — (2,3) is an internal obstacle. Cannot move there.\n   - L: (1,4) — not a wall or obstacle. Safe.\n   \nSo, after moving Left, the only safe move next would be Left again to (1,4). Then from (1,4), possible moves would be U or D (since L would go to (0,4), which is a wall).\n\nThis path leads towards the left wall, which might limit future options, but since no food is currently accessible, it's not immediately detrimental.\n\n### Alternative: Moving Up or Down\n\nIf we move Up to (3,5):\n\nNext possible moves (current direction is L, but we're moving U, so new direction is U):\nCannot move D (reverse).\nPossible: L, R, U.\n   - U: (3,6) — (3,6) is an obstacle. Cannot.\n   - L: (2,5) — (2,5) is an obstacle. Cannot.\n   - R: (4,5) — (4,5) is an obstacle. Cannot.\n   \nSo, moving Up would trap us with no safe moves next turn — this is bad.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down to (3,3):\n\nNext possible moves (direction is D):\nCannot move U.\nPossible: L, R, D.\n   - D: (3,2) — (3,2) is an obstacle. Cannot.\n   - L: (2,3) — (2,3) is an obstacle. Cannot.\n   - R: (4,3) — not a wall or obstacle. Safe.\n   \nSo, moving Down allows us to move Right next turn to (4,3), which is safe. This seems better than moving Up, which traps us.\n\nBetween moving Left (which allows only Left next turn) and Down (which allows Right next turn), Down seems slightly better because it gives more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Left is safe but limits next move to only Left again.\n- Moving Down is safe and allows a Right move next turn, providing more flexibility.\n- Moving Up is unsafe as it traps the snake next turn.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: The following cells are also walls:\n     - (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (3, 3), followed by body segments at (3, 4), (4, 4), and tail at (5, 4).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving Down (\"D\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (2, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (1, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Surroundings\n\nLet's visualize the snake's immediate surroundings to assess possible moves.\n\n- **Head at (3, 3)**, moving Down (\"D\").\n- Possible moves from current direction:\n  - **Down (D)**: (3, 2) → But (3, 2) is a wall (internal obstacle). **Invalid**.\n  - **Left (L)**: (2, 3) → (2, 3) is a wall (internal obstacle). **Invalid**.\n  - **Right (R)**: (4, 3) → Need to check if this is free.\n  - **Up (U)**: (3, 4) → This is the snake's own body segment. **Invalid** (would cause collision).\n\nFrom the current direction \"D\", the only possible moves are D, L, R (since U is opposite and not allowed immediately). But D and L are blocked by walls, so only R is possible.\n\nBut let's verify the no instant reverse rule: current direction is D, so opposite is U. Moving U is not allowed next, but U is already invalid due to body collision, so this doesn't affect us here.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Right (R) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Is (4, 3) a wall? \n     - Border walls: x=7 is wall, x=4 is not border.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5) and (4,6) are walls, but (4,3) is not listed. So, free.\n   - Is (4, 3) occupied by snake body?\n     - Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). No, (4,3) is free.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n2. **Other Directions**:\n   - Down (D) to (3,2): wall. Invalid.\n   - Left (L) to (2,3): wall. Invalid.\n   - Up (U) to (3,4): body segment. Invalid.\n\nSo, the only possible move is **Right (R)**.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving right leads to eating food or any dangers.\n\n- Moving to (4,3):\n  - Is there food at (4,3)? \n    - Current food positions: (1,5), (2,1), (1,2). No food at (4,3).\n  - So, no food eaten in this move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous if eaten next?\n\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4)\n- Food at:\n  - (1,5), (2,1), (1,2) → None adjacent to tail.\n- So, no immediate tail reward danger.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Spans**:\n  - (1,5): life_span = 1 → will disappear after this turn.\n  - (2,1): life_span = 6.\n  - (1,2): life_span = 9.\n- But none are reachable in this move, so not immediately relevant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state:\n- Only possible move is **Right (R)** to (4,3).\n- No food is eaten in this move.\n- No immediate dangers from this move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 21\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles (walls where the snake can't go):\n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (4,3)\n- Body: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]\nSo the snake's body is: Head at (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), and tail at (4,4).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right, which is +x direction)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,1): value = 6, life_span = 1\n2. (1,2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Current direction is R, so it cannot move Left (L) next.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5,3)\n- Check if (5,3) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=5 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7.\n    - Border walls: x=7 is at the edge, but 5 is not.\n    - Internal walls: (5,3) is not in the list.\n  - Not part of the snake's body:\n    - Snake body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). (5,3) is not in these.\n  - So (5,3) is free.\n- Food at (5,3)? No, the foods are at (2,1) and (1,2).\n- So moving R is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n- (4,4) is the current tail position.\n- Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n  - If the tail has positive food and the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it kills the snake.\n  - Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (4,3), tail at (4,4): yes, adjacent (directly below).\n  - Is there positive food at the tail? Let's see:\n    - Foods are at (2,1) and (1,2), not at (4,4).\n    - So no food at tail, so no danger.\n  - Also, is (4,4) a wall? No.\n  - So moving U is safe, but no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n- Check (4,2):\n  - Walls: (4,2) is not in the internal walls list, and within borders.\n  - Snake body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — not (4,2).\n  - Food at (4,2)? No.\n  - So moving D is safe but no food.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\n- Food at (2,1): value = +6\n- Food at (1,2): value = +8\n\nCan we reach either this turn?\n\nCurrent head at (4,3). Distance to:\n- (2,1): |4-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 (Manhattan distance)\n- (1,2): |4-1| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nWe can only move one step per turn, so cannot reach either food this turn. They'll disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we can't reach any food this turn, and all possible moves (R, U, D) are safe without eating food, we can choose any. But we should prefer moves that keep options open for future turns.\n\n- Moving R to (5,3): heads towards the right side, but there are walls at x=7.\n- Moving U to (4,4): moves towards the tail, but since the tail will move, this is okay.\n- Moving D to (4,2): moves down, away from current body.\n\nMoving D seems better to avoid getting boxed in, as moving R might lead towards the right wall with limited space, and U is towards the body which might limit future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nLet's see where each move takes us and if it leads to immediate danger next turn.\n\n1. Move R to (5,3):\n   - Next head at (5,3), body: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n   - Possible next moves from R: U, D, R (can't go L)\n   - Check adjacent:\n     - U (5,4): not wall, not body (body is at (3,4), (4,3), etc. — (5,4) is free)\n     - D (5,2): not wall, not body\n     - R (6,3): not wall (x=7 is wall, but 6 is okay), not body\n   - Seems safe next moves.\n\n2. Move U to (4,4):\n   - Next head at (4,4), body: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n   - Current direction was R, but we moved U, so next can't be D.\n   - Possible next moves: U, L, R\n     - U (4,5): check (4,5) — wall? (4,5) is in internal walls: yes, (4,5) is a wall. Can't go U.\n     - L (3,4): is body (yes, (3,4) is body) — can't go L.\n     - R (5,4): not wall, not body.\n   - So only R is possible next move, which may limit options.\n\n3. Move D to (4,2):\n   - Next head at (4,2), body: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n   - Current direction was R, moved D, so next can't be U.\n   - Possible next moves: D, L, R\n     - D (4,1): not wall (internal walls: (3,1) is wall, but (4,1) is not), not body.\n     - L (3,2): wall (internal walls list has (3,2)) — can't go L.\n     - R (5,2): not wall, not body.\n   - So possible next moves: D, R.\n\nMoving D seems to leave more options (D or R next) compared to moving U (only R next). Moving R also leaves all options, but moves towards the right wall which might not be ideal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween R, U, D:\n- R: safe, but moves towards right wall.\n- U: safe, but limits next move to only R.\n- D: safe, allows D or R next.\n\nI think moving Down (D) is the best choice here to maintain flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Game State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border walls**: Any cell where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall and cannot be moved into.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: \n  - Head: (4, 2)\n  - Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]\n- **Direction**: Down (D) — This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n#### Food:\nThere are three food items:\n1. (2, 1): value = 5, life_span = 1\n2. (1, 2): value = 7, life_span = 1\n3. (6, 5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n\nSo, possible moves are: Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### Current Snake Position:\n- Head: (4, 2)\n- Body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n- New head position: (4, 1) — because moving Down decreases y by 1.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=1 is not a border wall (borders are y=0 and y=7). \n    - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n  - Body collision: \n    - Current body segments are at (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). \n    - (4,1) is not in these positions, so no body collision.\n- Food at new position: \n  - No food is at (4,1).\n- After moving, the tail will move forward, so the body will be: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]. The tail (3,4) is removed.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n- New head position: (3, 2) — because moving Left decreases x by 1.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - x=3 is not a border wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (3,2) is in the internal obstacles list → **Collision!**\n  - So, moving Left is invalid due to wall collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n- New head position: (5, 2) — because moving Right increases x by 1.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - x=5 is not a border wall (borders are x=0 and x=7).\n    - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision:\n    - (5,2) is not in [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4)].\n- Food at new position:\n  - No food is at (5,2).\n- After moving, the body will be: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]. The tail (3,4) is removed.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable in the next move or if we should plan to move towards them.\n\nFood:\n1. (2,1): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (4,2): \n     - Manhattan distance: |4-2| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Cannot be reached in one move.\n2. (1,2): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-1| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n   - Cannot be reached in one move.\n3. (6,5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-6| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Cannot be reached in one move.\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including the current one). Therefore, none of the food items will be available next turn, so we don't need to consider moving towards them for immediate consumption.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (3,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: \n  - (2,4), (4,4), (3,5), (3,3)\n- Head is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is |4-3| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3, not 1).\n- Also, there is no food at the tail position (3,4), so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Left (L): leads to collision with an internal wall → invalid.\n- Down (D) and Right (R) are both valid moves with no immediate food to eat.\n  \nWe need to choose between D and R. Since both are safe, we can consider which one might be better for future moves.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,1): \n    - Cannot move Up (reverse of D), so can move Down, Left, Right.\n    - Down to (4,0): y=0 is a border wall → invalid.\n    - Left to (3,1): \n      - (3,1) is an internal obstacle → invalid.\n    - Right to (5,1):\n      - Not a wall or body → valid.\n  - So, from (4,1), only Right is possible next move.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n    - Cannot move Left (reverse of R), so can move Up, Down, Right.\n    - Up to (5,3):\n      - Not a wall or body → valid.\n    - Down to (5,1):\n      - Not a wall or body → valid.\n    - Right to (6,2):\n      - Not a wall or body → valid.\n  - More options available after moving Right.\n\nGiven that moving Right provides more flexibility for future moves compared to moving Down (which would leave only one valid move next), **moving Right (R) is the better choice**.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nJust to confirm, none of the food items are at (5,2), so we're not eating any food this turn. Also, all foods will disappear after this turn, so we don't need to consider them for future planning in this step.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to visualize the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: The list provided includes specific cells that are also walls.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)].\n     - Head is at (5,2).\n     - Next segment is at (4,2), then (4,3), and tail at (3,3).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items:\n     1. (2,1): value = 4, life_span = 1\n     2. (1,2): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     3. (6,5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - All foods have a value of +1 (positive food) since their values are positive.\n   - Their life spans are all 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch a simple representation to visualize the positions:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=5: - - - - - - F - \ny=4: - - - - - - - - \ny=3: - - B B - - - - \ny=2: - - - H B - - - \ny=1: - F - - - - - - \ny=0: -----------------\n     x=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n- H: Head at (5,2)\n- B: Body segments\n- F: Food items\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) = (5,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) = (5,1)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) = (4,2)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1,y) = (6,2)\n\n**No instant reverse rule**: Since the current direction is R, we cannot move Left (L) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n\nSo, valid moves are U, D, R.\n\n### Checking Each Move for Safety and Benefits\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (6,2)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - x=6 is not a border wall (x=7 is).\n     - (6,2) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body is at [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]. (6,2) is not in these.\n   - Food at (6,2)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check walls:\n     - y=3 is not a border wall.\n     - (5,3) is not in internal obstacles.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - (5,3) is not in [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)].\n   - Food at (5,3)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (5,1)**:\n   - Check walls:\n     - y=1 is not a border wall.\n     - (5,1) is not in internal obstacles.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - (5,1) is not in body segments.\n   - Food at (5,1)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn. Let's see if any are reachable:\n\n1. (2,1):\n   - Distance from head (5,2): |5-2| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4 (Manhattan distance).\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n2. (1,2):\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n3. (6,5):\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the foods can be eaten this turn since they're all more than one move away.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that's adjacent to the head, which could be dangerous if eaten next turn.\n\nTail is at (3,3). Adjacent cells to head (5,2):\n- (4,2), (6,2), (5,1), (5,3).\nTail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to head (distance is |5-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 > 1).\nSo, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll possible moves (U, D, R) are safe with no immediate food to eat. We should choose a move that positions the snake favorably for future food collection.\n\nLooking at the foods:\n- (6,5) is at the top right, value=9 (highest among foods).\n- Moving Right (R) to (6,2) gets us closer to the x=6 column where (6,5) is.\n- Then next moves could be Up to reach (6,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving Up to (5,3) doesn't seem to help much in reaching any food quickly.\n\nMoving Down to (5,1) is safe but doesn't seem advantageous.\n\n**Best choice**: Right (R) to (6,2), as it aligns the snake towards the highest value food at (6,5).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions After Move\n\nAfter moving R to (6,2), the new snake positions would be:\n- Head at (6,2)\n- Body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n- Tail was at (3,3), which moves to (4,3) (since the segment before tail was (4,3), but actually, the tail was at (3,3), and the segment before was (4,3), so the tail moves to where (4,3) was, but (4,3) is now the third segment. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nOriginal body: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\nAfter moving R:\n- New head: (6,2)\n- Body shifts: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n- Tail (3,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nNo overlaps or wall collisions.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates:\n     - (3, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at the following coordinates, with the head first:\n     - Head: (6, 5)\n     - Body: (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2)\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards (increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (1, 2): value = 3, life_span = 1\n     - (5, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (6,5)\n  - Body segments at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)\n  \n  This means the snake is mostly vertical along x=6 from y=2 to y=5, with a turn at (6,2) to (5,2).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Positive food (value=3), life_span=1\n  - (5,1): Positive food (value=8), life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is currently moving Up (U), it cannot move Down (D) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n   \n   So, possible moves at this turn: U, L, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an obstacle.\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (6,5) → (6,6)\n  - Check (6,6):\n    - Is it a wall? Border walls are at y=7, so y=6 is not a border wall.\n    - Is it an internal obstacle? The internal obstacles are listed, and (6,6) is not among them.\n    - Is it part of the snake's body? The snake's body is at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2). (6,6) is not occupied by the body.\n    - Is there food at (6,6)? No, food is at (1,2) and (5,1).\n    - **Conclusion**: Valid move, no food eaten.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (6,5) → (5,5)\n  - Check (5,5):\n    - Walls: Not a border wall, not an internal obstacle.\n    - Snake body: Not occupied by the body.\n    - Food: No food here.\n    - **Conclusion**: Valid move, no food eaten.\n\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5) → (7,5)\n  - Check (7,5):\n    - Walls: x=7 is a border wall.\n    - **Conclusion**: Invalid move, would collide with wall.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U, L\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving in any of these directions would allow the snake to eat food in the next steps.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6,6)**:\n   - Next moves from (6,6):\n     - Cannot move D (reverse of U), so possible: U, L, R\n     - U: (6,7) - y=7 is a wall, invalid.\n     - L: (5,6) - check:\n       - Walls: Not a wall.\n       - Body: Not currently, but need to see if tail moves.\n       - Food: No.\n     - R: (7,6) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n   - From (6,6), best is L to (5,6), then maybe towards food at (5,1), but that's several moves away.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5,5)**:\n   - From (5,5), possible directions (since last move was L, cannot move R):\n     - U: (5,6)\n     - D: (5,4)\n     - L: (4,5)\n   - Food at (5,1) is below at y=1. Moving down from (5,5) to (5,4), then (5,3), then (5,2), then (5,1).\n     - But at (5,2), the snake's tail is currently at (5,2), but the tail will move as the snake moves.\n     - After moving L to (5,5), the snake's body will be:\n       - Head: (5,5)\n       - Body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n     - Next move D to (5,4):\n       - Body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n     - Next move D to (5,3):\n       - Body: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n     - Next move D to (5,2):\n       - Body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)\n       - Original tail was at (5,2), which has moved away, so (5,2) is now empty.\n     - Next move D to (5,1):\n       - (5,1) has food with value=8.\n       - But we need to check if the tail is adjacent when eating.\n       - Before moving to (5,1), the body is at (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5).\n       - Wait, the length increases by 1 when eating, so after eating, the tail would be at (5,2), but the head is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (5,2) (they are one apart vertically).\n       - So no immediate collision from tail growth.\n       - **However**, the food at (5,1) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n         - But we're at turn 27, and the food's life_span is 1, so at turn 28 it will disappear.\n         - So we cannot reach it in time unless we eat it now, but we're at (6,5), and (5,1) is not adjacent to (6,5).\n         - So we cannot eat (5,1) this turn.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,2) is too far to reach before it disappears (life_span=1).\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Food\n\nNeither food can be eaten this turn because:\n\n- To eat food, the head must move onto the food cell this turn.\n- Current head is at (6,5), food is at (1,2) and (5,1), neither is adjacent to (6,5).\n  - Adjacent cells to (6,5):\n    - U: (6,6)\n    - D: (6,4) - but cannot move D (reverse)\n    - L: (5,5)\n    - R: (7,5) - wall\n  - Neither (5,5) nor (6,6) have food.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Choosing Between U and L\n\nSince no food can be eaten immediately, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it for future food.\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (6,6)**:\n  - Next turn, from (6,6), can move L to (5,6), then possibly down towards where food might spawn.\n  - But moving up brings the snake closer to the top wall (y=7), limiting space.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (5,5)**:\n  - Opens more options to move down towards the center where food might appear.\n  - From (5,5), can move D to (5,4), etc., towards the lower half.\n\n**Potential Risk**:\n- Moving U to (6,6): The body is at (6,4), (6,3), etc., so no immediate collision.\n- Moving L to (5,5): The body is at (6,4), etc., no collision.\n\nBoth moves are safe, but moving left seems better as it keeps the snake more centered and allows more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Future Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at (5,1) is about to disappear, and (1,2) is also about to disappear. Since we can't reach them, we should ignore them for this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also ensure that the move doesn't lead the snake into a position where it can get trapped.\n\n- Moving U to (6,6):\n  - Next move could be L to (5,6), then options are limited as moving up is towards the wall.\n- Moving L to (5,5):\n  - More open space to maneuver.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. No food can be eaten this turn.\n2. Both U and L are valid moves.\n3. Moving left seems to offer more flexibility for future moves.\n\n**Final Decision**: Move Left (L)\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 28  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (5,5)\n- Body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are in a vertical line going down from (6,5) to (6,2).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so its head moved from (6,5) to (5,5).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,2): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (5,1): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (5,5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: Move to (4,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,5) is not in the wall list (internal obstacles include (4,5)? Wait, looking at internal obstacles: (4,5) is listed! So (4,5) is a wall. Cannot move left.\n   - **Invalid move**\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (5,6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the upper border, so y=6 is within bounds. Are there any internal walls at (5,6)? Not listed.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). (5,6) is not in these.\n   - Food at (5,6)? No food listed there.\n   - **Valid move**, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (5,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is the lower border, y=4 is within bounds. Any internal walls at (5,4)? Not listed.\n     - Body: (5,4) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n   - **Valid move**, but no immediate reward.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: Normally, this would be opposite to current direction (L), but since the snake just moved left to (5,5) from (6,5), moving right would take it back to (6,5). \n   - However, the rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n   - Current direction is L, so R is opposite. **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, valid moves are U and D.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food items:\n\n1. (1,2): value=2, life_span=1\n   - Distance from (5,5): |5-1| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n\n2. (5,1): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable in one move.\n\n3. (5,5): value=10, life_span=1\n   - This is directly under the snake's head! But the rules say:\n     - Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n       1. The body moves away, and\n       2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the head is at (5,5), which is where the food is. But the body is at (6,5), (6,4), etc., not overlapping with (5,5) except the head.\n   - Wait, the head is at (5,5), and the food is at (5,5). So the food is under the head.\n   - To eat it, the body must move away, then the head moves onto it. But the head is already on it. So can't eat it this turn.\n   - Also, even if we could, there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Here, the tail is at (6,2). Adjacent cells to head (5,5) are (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5). (6,2) is not adjacent, so no danger from that.\n   - But since the food is under the head, and we can't eat it unless the body moves away first, which isn't possible in one move, we can't eat it now.\n\nSo, none of the food is immediately eatable in the next move.\n\n### Choosing Between U and D\n\nBoth U and D are safe moves with no immediate reward. We need to consider which move sets us up better for future moves.\n\n- **Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,6): U (to y=7, which is a wall), D (back to 5,5), L (to 4,6), R (to 6,6)\n  - (4,6) is a wall (internal obstacle), (6,6) is free.\n  - So from (5,6), can move U (wall), D (back), R (to 6,6)\n\n- **Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,4): U (back to 5,5), D (to 5,3), L (to 4,4), R (to 6,4)\n  - (6,4) is part of the body (next turn, body will be [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)], so (6,4) is body, but tail is at (6,2) which will move to (6,3), so (6,4) is still body.\n  - (4,4) is free, (5,3) is free.\n\nBetween U and D, both are safe, but moving D might give more options next turn since moving U leads to a position where two moves are blocked (U and L), whereas D only has R blocked by body.\n\nHowever, moving D to (5,4) brings us closer to the food at (5,1), but that food disappears after this turn, so not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (5,6) is near the top border, which might limit future moves.\n\nGiven that, moving D seems slightly better as it keeps more options open next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving D to (5,4)?\n- Next turn, body will be [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n- Head at (5,4), body at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n- No walls at (5,4), no body collision unless we move into body next turn.\n\nSimilarly for U to (5,6):\n- Next turn, body: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n- Head at (5,6), body at (5,5), etc.\n- No immediate collision.\n\nBoth are safe, but D seems to keep more options open.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both U and D are safe and neither leads to immediate food, and D seems to offer slightly better future mobility, I'll choose D.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n   - Current direction: Down (D)\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1,2): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (5,1): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (5,5): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and the food positions:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (5,4)\n  - Body segments: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n  \n  Drawing this:\n  - (6,3) is the tail.\n  - The snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape from (5,4) to (6,3).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Far to the left, near the top.\n  - (5,1): Directly below the head, near the bottom wall.\n  - (5,5): On the body segment (5,5), which is the first segment after the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe current direction is Down (D). The possible moves are:\n- Up (U): Opposite direction → Not allowed (instant reverse).\n- Down (D): Continue down.\n- Left (L): Move left.\n- Right (R): Move right.\n\nSo, possible actions: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D)\n- Current head: (5,4)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: y=0 is at y=0, so y=3 is safe.\n- **Internal obstacles**: Check if (5,3) is an obstacle. From the list: no.\n- **Body collision**: Snake body is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). (5,3) is not in the body → safe.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- Food at (5,3)? No.\n  \nOutcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: x=0 is at x=0, so x=4 is safe.\n- **Internal obstacles**: (4,5) and (4,6) are obstacles, but not (4,4) → safe.\n- **Body collision**: (4,4) not in body → safe.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- Food at (4,4)? No.\n  \nOutcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- **Walls**: x=7 is at x=7, so x=6 is safe.\n- **Internal obstacles**: No obstacle at (6,4).\n- **Body collision**: (6,4) is currently occupied by the body segment before the tail. But according to the rules, moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail will move forward. However, (6,4) is not the tail; it's the second last segment. The tail is at (6,3). So moving to (6,4) would collide with the body → deadly.\n  \nOutcome: Collision with body → invalid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next move:\n\n1. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Currently under the body segment (5,5).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (5,5), and the head must move onto (5,5).\n   - Current head is at (5,4). To move to (5,5), we'd need to move Up (U), but current direction is D, and U is opposite → illegal.\n   - Alternatively, if the body moves away, but the head isn't moving onto it this turn → can't eat now.\n\n2. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - To reach (5,1) from (5,4), need to move Down three times.\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear next turn → cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **Food at (1,2)**:\n   - Far away, life span 1 → cannot reach in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4).\n- Head is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (6,3) → no immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- D: Safe, no food.\n- L: Safe, no food.\n- R: Collision → invalid.\n\nBetween D and L, both are safe with no immediate benefit. We can choose either. Typically, it's good to move towards areas with more space to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,3):\n  - Adjacent cells: (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4).\n  - (6,3) is tail (will move), (5,4) is body, (5,2) is safe, (4,3) is safe.\n  \n- Moving Left (L) to (4,4):\n  - Adjacent cells: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n  - (5,4) is body, (4,5) is obstacle, (3,4) is safe, (4,3) is safe.\n\nBoth moves leave some safe options next turn. Moving Left might open up more space since moving Down is towards the bottom wall (y=0), which is closer.\n\nGiven that, **Left (L)** seems slightly better to explore more space.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at Turn 30.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) are at:\n     - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n     - Head at (4,4), next segment at (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), tail at (6,4).\n   - Current head direction: Left (L). This means the last move was from (5,4) to (4,4).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Two food items:\n     - (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n     - (5,5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - Both are positive foods (value +1).\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the last move was Left (from (5,4) to (4,4)), the snake cannot move Right immediately (that would be reverse).\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L (but not R).\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety (no collision) and potential benefits (eating food).\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (x, y+1) → (4,5)\n\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) → (4,5) is not in these, so no body collision.\n  - Walls: Check if (4,5) is a wall.\n    - Internal walls: (4,5) is listed as an internal obstacle → **Collision!**\n  \nSo, moving Up is not safe.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (x, y-1) → (4,3)\n\n- New head position: (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (4,3) is not in [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)] → no body collision.\n  - Walls: Is (4,3) a wall?\n    - Internal walls list doesn't include (4,3).\n    - Borders: x=4 is between 0 and 7, y=3 is between 0 and 7 → no border collision.\n  \nSo, moving Down is safe.\n\nNow, check if moving Down leads to eating food:\n- Food at (5,1) and (5,5). (4,3) is not a food position → no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (x-1, y) → (3,4)\n\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (3,4) is not in [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)] → no body collision.\n  - Walls: Is (3,4) a wall?\n    - Internal walls: (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) are listed, but not (3,4).\n    - Borders: x=3 is between 0 and 7, y=4 is between 0 and 7 → no border collision.\n  \nSo, moving Left is safe.\n\nCheck for food:\n- Food at (5,1) and (5,5). (3,4) is not a food position → no food eaten.\n\n### Comparing Safe Moves: Down vs. Left\n\nBoth Down and Left are safe moves that don't eat food immediately. Now, let's see which is better strategically.\n\n1. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Currently at (5,5) is a body segment (third segment: (5,5)).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it.\n   - Currently, moving Left or Down doesn't help directly, but moving Down might help in future steps to reach other food.\n\n2. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Position (5,1): To reach this, the snake needs to move towards lower y.\n   - Current head at (4,4). To go to (5,1), possible path: move Down to (4,3), then Right to (5,3), then Down to (5,2), then Down to (5,1).\n   - Moving Down now aligns with this path.\n\n3. **Tail Position**:\n   - Tail is at (6,4). After any move, the tail will move forward (from (6,4) to (6,5)? Wait, no:\n     - Current body: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n     - If head moves to (new_pos), body becomes [ (new_pos), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) ], tail (6,4) is removed.\n     - So tail is moving from (6,4) to (6,5)? Wait, no, the segment before tail is (6,5), so tail moves to where (6,5) was, but since (6,5) is now one forward, tail moves to (5,5)? Hmm, need to clarify tail movement.\n     - Actually, the tail is the last segment. When the head moves, the last segment is removed unless eating food.\n     - So after moving, the new body is [new_head, (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)], and (6,4) is removed.\n     - So tail moves from (6,4) to (6,5) is incorrect; tail is now at (6,5), which was previously the second last segment.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but the main point is that moving Down or Left doesn't immediately affect the tail's position regarding food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (6,4).\n- Adjacent to head (4,4): adjacent cells are (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n   - (5,4) is adjacent and is the second segment.\n   - (6,4) is not adjacent to (4,4) (distance is 2 in x).\n   - So no adjacency to tail currently.\n\nThus, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Decision Between Down and Left\n\nBoth are safe, but:\n\n- Moving Down to (4,3):\n  - Opens possibility to go towards (5,1) food in future.\n  - Next moves could be Right to (5,3), then Down to (5,2), then Down to (5,1).\n\n- Moving Left to (3,4):\n  - Moves away from the (5,1) food.\n  - Next moves could be Down to (3,3), but not directly towards food.\n\nTherefore, moving Down seems more strategic to eventually reach the food at (5,1).\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately?\n\n- Food at (5,5): is under the body at (5,5). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away first, then head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, (5,5) is the third segment. To move away, the segment before it (5,4) must move, but that's the second segment.\n  - Not immediately possible to eat (5,5) in one move.\n\n- Food at (5,1): is at (5,1), not reachable in one move from (4,4).\n\nSo no immediate food to eat; must plan for future.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Down and Left), Down is better for future pathing towards the food at (5,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n\n- **Position**: (4,2)\n- **Check for Walls**: y=2 is not a border wall. Check internal obstacles: (3,2), (2,2) are obstacles, but (4,2) is not listed as an obstacle. So, no wall collision.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: Snake body is at [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)]. (4,2) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Check for Food**: (4,2) has food with value +1, life_span 10.\n  \n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (6,5). The head at (4,2) is not adjacent to (6,5) (distance is more than 1), so no danger from tail reward.\n  \n  - **Eating Food**: Moving to (4,2) would eat the food, increasing length by 1 and score by 1.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,3)\n\n- **Position**: (3,3)\n- **Check for Walls**: x=3 is not a border wall. Check internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) are obstacles, but (3,3) is not listed. So, no wall collision.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: Snake body is at [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)]. (3,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (3,3).\n  \n  - **Safety**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,3)\n\n- **Position**: (5,3)\n- **Check for Walls**: x=5 is not a border wall. Check internal obstacles: None at (5,3). So, no wall collision.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: Snake body is at [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)]. (5,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (5,3).\n  \n  - **Safety**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nFrom the possible moves, only moving Down to (4,2) allows eating food. The other moves are safe but don't provide immediate rewards.\n\n**Food at (4,2)**:\n- Value: +1\n- Life_span: 10 (so it will disappear after 10 more turns, including this one)\n  \nSince it's positive food and there's no danger from the tail, eating it is beneficial.\n\n### Checking Other Food Items for Future Planning\n\nWhile we're deciding the immediate move, it's good to note other food positions for future:\n\n1. (5,1): \n   - Current position: (4,3). To reach (5,1), path could be Right then Down twice, but need to check obstacles.\n   - Obstacles: (3,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc., but path seems possible.\n   \n2. (5,5):\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (5,5). Can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n   - Since the tail is at (6,5), moving the head to (5,5) now would mean the tail moves to (5,5) after, causing collision (head and new tail at same spot), which is deadly (\"Tail Reward Danger\").\n   - So, cannot eat (5,5) now.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving Down to (4,2) eats food, but need to ensure next moves are safe.\n  \n  After moving to (4,2), next possible moves would be from (4,2):\n  - Current direction would be D (since we moved D).\n  - Possible next moves: D (to (4,1)), L (to (3,2)), R (to (5,2)).\n  \n  - (4,1): y=1 is not border, but (3,1) is obstacle, (4,1) is safe.\n  - (3,2): obstacle.\n  - (5,2): no obstacle, safe.\n  \n  So, future moves seem manageable.\n\n### Alternative Safe Moves Without Eating\n\nIf we choose not to eat now:\n- Left to (3,3) or Right to (5,3) are safe but no reward.\n  \nHowever, since eating is safe and beneficial, it's better to eat now.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for (5,5)\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if moving to (5,5) is possible and safe:\n\n- Current head at (4,3), to reach (5,5):\n  - Need to move Right to (5,3), then Down to (5,4), then Left to (4,4), etc., but (5,5) is currently occupied by body.\n  \n  - Only way is if body moves away first, but currently the body is at (5,5), and tail is at (6,5). Next move tail moves to (5,5), so head cannot be at (5,5) at the same time as tail is moving there, hence collision.\n\nThus, cannot eat (5,5) safely now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to (4,2) to eat the positive food there, as it's safe and increases the score and length.\n\nOther moves are safe but don't provide immediate benefits.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

From (4,1), the next move could be Right to (5,1) to eat the food.\n  - Does not move towards the food under the body at (5,5), avoiding potential tail collision risk.\n  \n- **Cons**:\n  - Moving down to (4,1) doesn't immediately eat any food.\n  - Need to ensure that moving right next turn is possible to reach (5,1).\n\n**Option 2: Move Right (R) to (5,2)**\n\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves closer to the food at (5,1), setting up to move down next turn to (5,1).\n  - Avoids moving towards the body segment at (5,5).\n  \n- **Cons**:\n  - Similar to moving down, doesn't immediately eat food.\n  - Next move would be Down to (5,1), which is valid unless the snake's body moves in a way that blocks it.\n\n### Considering Food Under the Body at (5,5)\n\nThe food at (5,5) is under the snake's body. To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (5,5).\n2. The head must then move onto (5,5).\n\nCurrently, the snake's tail is at (6,5). Moving the head towards (5,5) is risky because:\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, but the head would be at (5,5), and the new tail would be at (5,5) (since the snake grows by 1), causing a collision.\n- This is the \"Tail Reward Danger\" scenario where eating food adjacent to the tail is deadly.\n\nThus, we should **avoid trying to eat the food at (5,5)**.\n\n### Deciding Between Down (D) and Right (R)\n\nBoth moves are safe, but let's see which one better positions us to eat the food at (5,1):\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (4,1)**:\n   - Next turn, can move Right to (5,1) to eat the food.\n   - Snake body will have moved: tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5), but this doesn't affect the path to (5,1).\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (5,2)**:\n   - Next turn, can move Down to (5,1) to eat the food.\n   - Snake body moves: tail at (6,5) moves to (5,5), but (5,1) is still accessible.\n\nBoth sequences lead to eating the food at (5,1) in two moves. However, moving Down first might be slightly better because:\n- After moving Down to (4,1), the next move Right to (5,1) is straightforward.\n- Moving Right first to (5,2) then Down to (5,1) is also fine, but perhaps less direct.\n\nHowever, both are equally valid in terms of reaching the food. \n\n### Checking Immediate Food Access\n\nIs there any immediate food we can eat in one move?\n\n- Current head at (4,2). Adjacent cells:\n  - Up (U): (4,3) - part of the body, cannot eat.\n  - Down (D): (4,1) - no food.\n  - Left (L): (3,2) - obstacle.\n  - Right (R): (5,2) - no food.\n\nNo immediate food to eat in one move.\n\n### Checking for Risks\n\n- Moving Down to (4,1):\n  - Next position: head at (4,1), body at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n  - Then can move Right to (5,1) to eat food.\n  - No collision risks in this path.\n\n- Moving Right to (5,2):\n  - Next position: head at (5,2), body at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n  - Then can move Down to (5,1) to eat food.\n  - Also no collision risks.\n\nBoth options are safe.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\n- Food at (5,1): life_span=4 (will disappear after 4 more turns, including current).\n- Food at (5,5): life_span=6 (will disappear after 6 more turns).\n\nWe have time to reach (5,1), but should prioritize it since it disappears sooner.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Down (D) and Right (R) are safe and lead to eating the food at (5,1) in two moves. \n\nChoosing **Down (D)** first seems slightly more straightforward because:\n- From (4,1), moving Right to (5,1) is a direct path to the food.\n- From (5,2), moving Down to (5,1) is also direct, but perhaps less intuitive.\n\nHowever, both are equally valid. Given that, and since the snake is currently moving Down, continuing in the same direction unless there's a reason to turn is a common strategy to avoid unnecessary turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating both options, the safest and most straightforward immediate action is to continue moving Down to position (4,1), setting up to eat the food at (5,1) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn:** 33  \n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head at (4,1)\n- Body segments: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body is:\n- Head: (4,1)\n- Next: (4,2)\n- Then: (4,3)\n- Then: (4,4)\n- Then: (5,4)\n- Tail: (5,5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving Down to reach its current head position at (4,1). The previous position was (4,2), so it moved from (4,2) to (4,1), which is Down (since y decreases).\n\n**Food:**\n1. (5,1) - value: 3, life_span: 1\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, snake length +1)\n   - Disappears after 1 more turn (since life_span decreases this turn)\n2. (5,5) - value: 5, life_span: 1\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, snake length +1)\n   - Disappears after 1 more turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,1) with direction D (Down), the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up):** (4,1) → (4,2)\n  - But the snake's next segment is at (4,2), so this would be a body collision (unless it's the tail, which it's not; the tail is at (5,5)). So, moving Up would collide with the body at (4,2) → **Deadly**\n- **D (Down):** (4,1) → (4,0)\n  - y=0 is a border wall → **Deadly**\n- **L (Left):** (4,1) → (3,1)\n  - Check for walls: (3,1) is an internal obstacle → **Deadly**\n- **R (Right):** (4,1) → (5,1)\n  - Check for walls: (5,1) is not listed as a wall or obstacle\n  - Check for body: Snake body is at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) → (5,1) is not in the body\n  - So, moving Right is safe in terms of collision.\n\nBut wait, there's food at (5,1). If we move Right to (5,1), we eat that food. Let's check the implications:\n\n### Eating the Food at (5,1)\n\n- Food at (5,1): value=3 (positive), life_span=1\n  - Eating it gives +1 score, snake length increases by 1\n  - After eating, the new head is at (5,1), and the body extends to include the old head (4,1)\n  - New snake positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n    - Length increases from 6 to 7\n  - Need to check if this causes any immediate collision next turn:\n    - The tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to the new head (5,1), so no tail reward danger\n    - The new body segments are all behind the head, no immediate collision\n\n### Alternative: Avoiding the Food at (5,1)\n\nBut moving Right is the only safe move, as other directions lead to death. So, we have to move Right to (5,1) and eat the food there.\n\nWait, is there any other consideration? The other food is at (5,5), which is where the tail is. \n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (5,5), head is at (4,1) → not adjacent (they are 4 units apart in x and y)\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Checking the Other Food at (5,5)\n\nThe other food is at (5,5), which is where the tail is. Currently, the head is at (4,1), not adjacent to (5,5). Even if we move towards it, by the time we reach near the tail, the tail would have moved unless we eat other food to make the snake longer.\n\nBut in the immediate next turn, the food at (5,5) is not accessible unless we can reach it in one move, which we can't from (4,1).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Right to (5,1), which also allows us to eat positive food there. Other moves lead to immediate death.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is D (Down). Last move was from (4,2) to (4,1) (Down). Next move cannot be U (Up), which is the opposite of D. But U is already deadly due to body collision, so it's not an option anyway.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 35  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first):\n- Head: (6,1)\n- Body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (right, meaning it was moving towards increasing x, i.e., from (5,1) to (6,1))\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5): value = 3, life_span = 1\n2. (4,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (6,1)\n  - Then (5,1), (4,1), then turns up to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), then right to (5,4)\n  \nSo the snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape with the tail at (5,4).\n\nFood:\n- (5,5): near the tail, value 3, disappears next turn\n- (4,4): part of the snake's body (the segment before the tail), value 9, disappears next turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is R (right). From (6,1), possible moves are:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: to (7,1)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly\n   - **Invalid**\n\n2. **Up (U)**: to (6,2)\n   - Check walls: no wall at (6,2)\n   - Check body: \n     - Snake body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n     - (6,2) is not in the body → safe\n   - **Valid**\n\n3. **Down (D)**: to (6,0)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a border wall → collision → deadly\n   - **Invalid**\n\n4. **Left (L)**: to (5,1)\n   - Opposite of current direction (R) → is this allowed?\n   - Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n     - Current direction is R, so L is opposite → **Invalid**\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Up (U)** to (6,2).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up leads us to any food or has any risks.\n\n- Moving to (6,2):\n  - Is there food at (6,2)? No.\n  - Food is at (5,5) and (4,4).\n    - (4,4) is part of the snake's body. Can we eat it?\n      - Rule: Food under body can only be eaten if:\n        1. Body moves away (i.e., the segment moves), and\n        2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n      - Currently, (4,4) is the 6th segment (from head). Next move:\n        - Head moves to (6,2)\n        - Body segments shift: new positions:\n          - (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n          - Wait, no: actually, the tail is at (5,4), and the segment before is (4,4).\n          - When head moves to (6,2), the tail (5,4) moves away (where does it go? It follows the body).\n          - Actually, the body moves forward: the segment at (5,1) moves to where the head was (6,1), etc., and the tail (5,4) is removed unless we eat food.\n          - Since we're not eating any food now, length stays the same, so tail (5,4) is removed, and the new tail is the previous segment's position.\n          - So new body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n          - (4,4) is still part of the body, so the food there is still under the body, not accessible this turn.\n    - (5,5): not reachable this turn.\n\n### Is There Any Risk?\n\n- Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n  - Current tail is at (5,4).\n  - Adjacent to tail: positions sharing x or y differing by 1:\n    - (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4)\n  - Head is at (6,1), moving to (6,2) → not adjacent to tail → no danger.\n  - Food at (5,5): adjacent to tail, but we're not moving there.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other move we can make? Only U is valid, others are invalid due to walls or reverse move.\n\n### Food Lifespan\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn. So if we don't eat them now, they're gone.\n\n- (5,5): value 3\n  - To eat it, we'd need to move to (5,5) from (6,1), which is not possible in one move (distance is (6-5=1 in x, 5-1=4 in y).\n- (4,4): value 9, under body\n  - To eat it, we'd need the body to move away and head to move onto it.\n  - Currently, (4,4) is the segment before tail.\n  - Next turn, if we move U to (6,2), body shifts:\n    - Head: (6,2)\n    - Body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n    - So (4,4) is still under body, can't eat it.\n  - Maybe if we could move in a way that the body moves away from (4,4), but only U is possible now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly valid move is Up (U) to (6,2). It doesn't lead to any food this turn, but it's safe. The foods will disappear next turn, but we can't reach them safely now.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot move D next.\n   - Allowed moves: U, L, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a wall or obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (6,2).\n   - Possible moves from (6,2):\n     - U: (6,3) - Check for walls/obstacles.\n       - y=3 is not a border wall.\n       - Check internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5).\n         - (6,3) is not in the list, so it's free.\n     - L: (5,2) - Check:\n       - Not a border wall.\n       - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is not listed, so free.\n     - R: (7,2) - Check:\n       - x=7 is a border wall, so cannot move R.\n\nSo, possible moves: U or L.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving U or L can lead to eating food:\n\n1. **Move U to (6,3)**:\n   - Next head position: (6,3).\n   - Is there food at (6,3)? No.\n   - Food is at (5,5) and (4,4).\n\n2. **Move L to (5,2)**:\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n   - Is there food at (5,2)? No.\n   - But moving left might help in reaching (5,5) in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail:\n\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (4,4), which has food (4,4,8,1).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n  - Head: (6,2), Tail: (4,4).\n  - Adjacent means one coordinate is the same and the other differs by 1, or both differ by 1 (for diagonal adjacency, but snake moves orthogonally).\n  - Distance: |6-4|=2, |2-4|=2. Not adjacent (needs at least one coordinate difference <=1).\n  - So, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\nBut if we move towards the tail food, we need to be careful not to make the head adjacent to the tail when the tail has food.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move U to (6,3)**:\n- Pros:\n  - Moves away from the tail, reducing risk.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves.\n- Cons:\n  - Doesn't directly lead to food.\n  - Food at (5,5) is two moves away (L then U), but life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn.\n\n**Option 2: Move L to (5,2)**:\n- Pros:\n  - Moves towards the food at (5,5).\n    - Next move could be U to (5,3), then U to (5,4), then U to (5,5).\n    - But food at (5,5) has life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn (current turn is 36, next is 37, food disappears).\n    - So cannot reach (5,5) in time.\n- Cons:\n  - Doesn't lead to immediate food.\n  - Moves towards the center where there are more obstacles.\n\nGiven that the food at (5,5) will disappear next turn and we can't reach it in one move, moving towards it is not beneficial.\n\n**Food at (4,4)**:\n- Currently under the tail.\n- To eat it:\n  - Need to move the tail away, then head onto it.\n  - This would require multiple moves where the head moves towards (4,4) while the tail moves away.\n  - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn.\n  - Cannot eat it in one move.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten in the next move?\n\n- No food is adjacent to the head (6,2):\n  - Adjacent cells: (6,3), (5,2), (7,2) (but R is blocked).\n  - No food at (6,3) or (5,2).\n\n### Safety of Moves\n\nCheck if moving U or L leads to a safe position:\n\n1. **Move U to (6,3)**:\n   - New head position: (6,3).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n     - (6,3) is not in the body, safe.\n   - Next possible moves from (6,3):\n     - Current direction would be U.\n     - Cannot move D.\n     - Can move U to (6,4), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) (but x=7 is wall, so only U or L).\n\n2. **Move L to (5,2)**:\n   - New head position: (5,2).\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (5,2) is not in the body, safe.\n   - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n     - Current direction would be L.\n     - Cannot move R.\n     - Can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2).\n     - (5,1) is in the body (second segment), so cannot move D.\n     - So possible: U or L.\n\nBoth moves seem safe, but moving U seems slightly better as it moves away from the tail and the crowded area near the walls and obstacles.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nAfter moving U to (6,3), next turn:\n\n- Food at (5,5) and (4,4) will disappear (life_span=1, current turn is 36).\n- New food may spawn.\n- From (6,3), can move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3), keeping options open.\n\nMoving L to (5,2) brings the head closer to the center where there are more obstacles, which might limit future moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- No immediate food can be eaten in the next move.\n- Both U and L are safe moves.\n- Moving U keeps the snake away from the crowded center and obstacles.\n- Moving L doesn't provide any immediate benefit and may limit future moves.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Up (U).**\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. The head is at (6,3), and the tail is at (4,3).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its last move was in the positive y-direction.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items:\n     - (5,5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n     - (4,4): value = 7, life_span = 1\n     - (4,3): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake's current direction is Up, it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible immediate moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) from (6,3) to (6,4)\n- **New Head Position**: (6,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - x=6 is not a border wall (x=0 or x=7 are borders).\n    - y=4 is not a border wall (y=0 or y=7 are borders).\n    - (6,4) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - **Body Collision**: \n    - Current body segments: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n    - (6,4) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food is at (6,4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) from (6,3) to (5,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - (5,3) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n  - **Body Collision**:\n    - (5,3) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food is at (5,3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) from (6,3) to (7,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (7,3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - x=7 is a border wall.\n  - **Body Collision**: N/A (already hitting wall)\n- **Conclusion**: Moving right would hit the wall → deadly collision. Not a valid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their implications:\n\n1. **(5,5)**: value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (6,3): \n     - Δx = |5-6| = 1, Δy = |5-3| = 2 → Manhattan distance = 3\n   - Not adjacent; cannot reach in one move.\n2. **(4,4)**: value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (6,3):\n     - Δx = |4-6| = 2, Δy = |4-3| = 1 → Manhattan distance = 3\n   - Not adjacent; cannot reach in one move.\n3. **(4,3)**: value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (6,3):\n     - Δx = |4-6| = 2, Δy = |3-3| = 0 → Manhattan distance = 2\n   - Not adjacent; cannot reach in one move.\n\nHowever, the food at (4,3) is currently under the snake's tail segment (the last position in the snake's body is (4,3)). \n\n**Special Case for Food Under Body**:\n- The food at (4,3) is under the tail.\n- To eat it:\n  - The tail must move away (which it will if the snake moves, as the tail follows).\n  - Then, the head must move onto (4,3) in a subsequent move.\n- But currently, the head is at (6,3), and the tail is at (4,3). The head cannot reach (4,3) in one move (distance is 2).\n  \n**Tail Reward Danger**:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it is dangerous because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, the head is at (6,3), tail at (4,3). They are not adjacent (distance is 2), so this isn't an immediate concern.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Actions\n\nGiven that none of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake to potentially reach high-value food in future moves.\n\nFrom the possible safe moves:\n- Up (U) to (6,4)\n- Left (L) to (5,3)\n\n**Choosing Between U and L**:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6,4)**:\n   - Moves away from the current body.\n   - Opens up more space; from (6,4), possible next moves could be towards higher-value food like (4,4) or (5,5).\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5,3)**:\n   - Moves towards the center of the grid.\n   - From (5,3), could potentially move towards (4,4) or other areas.\n\n**Potential Future Moves**:\n- The food at (4,4) has value 7, which is high. Moving towards it could be beneficial.\n  - From (6,4), to reach (4,4):\n    - Next move could be L to (5,4), then L to (4,4).\n  - From (5,3), to reach (4,4):\n    - Next move could be U to (5,4), then L to (4,4).\n\nBoth paths require two moves to reach (4,4). However, moving Up first might keep more options open as it moves away from the current body's position.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\n- After moving U to (6,4), the next possible moves would be U, L, R (not D, as that would be reverse from U).\n  - U to (6,5): \n    - Check walls: (6,5) is not a wall or body (current body will have moved; new tail is (6,1) removed, new segment at (6,3)).\n    - Safe.\n  - L to (5,4):\n    - Not a wall or body.\n    - Safe.\n  - R to (7,4):\n    - x=7 is wall → invalid.\n  \n- After moving L to (5,3), next possible moves would be U, D, L (not R, as that would be reverse from L).\n  - U to (5,4):\n    - Safe.\n  - D to (5,2):\n    - Check walls: (5,2) is not a wall.\n    - Body: The body will be [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] → (5,2) is not in body.\n    - Safe.\n  - L to (4,3):\n    - (4,3) is currently the tail, but after move L to (5,3), the tail moves to (6,1), so (4,3) is not body.\n    - But (4,3) has food with value 10.\n    - However, the food's life_span is 1, and this is turn 37. Assuming the food disappears after turn 37 + 1 = 38, so it's still there next turn.\n    - But to eat it, need to move to (4,3) from (5,3) via L.\n    - Then, the head moves to (4,3), eats food (value 10), length increases by 1, new tail is (6,1) (since the old tail was (6,1), now the new tail is the segment before that, which is (6,2)).\n    - Then, the head is at (4,3), body is [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)].\n    - Next move from (4,3):\n      - Cannot go R (reverse of L).\n      - Possible U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n      - (4,4) is food (value 7), but need to check if it's safe to eat.\n        - After moving U to (4,4), new head is at (4,4), body is [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), ...]\n        - Tail is at (4,2).\n        - Is (4,2) adjacent to (4,4)? No, distance is 2.\n        - So safe to eat (4,4) after eating (4,3).\n    - This seems like a high-reward path: eat (4,3) (value 10), then (4,4) (value 7).\n\nGiven this, moving Left now sets up a path to eat two high-value foods in the next two moves.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Eating (4,3)\n\nFrom current position (6,3), move L to (5,3), then L to (4,3):\n\n1. After first L to (5,3), body is [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)].\n   - Tail is at (4,2).\n2. Next move L to (4,3):\n   - (4,3) is food.\n   - Eat it: length increases by 1, new body is [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)].\n   - New tail is (4,2) (since the old tail was (4,2), now the segment before that is (4,1)).\n   - Now, head is at (4,3), tail is at (4,1).\n   - Next move options from (4,3):\n     - Cannot go R (reverse of L).\n     - U to (4,4): \n       - (4,4) is food (value 7).\n       - After move, head at (4,4), body is [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), ...], tail is at (4,1).\n       - Distance from head to tail is |4-4| + |4-1| = 3, not adjacent → safe.\n     - D to (4,2):\n       - (4,2) is body segment → collision.\n     - L to (3,3):\n       - Check walls: (3,3) is not a wall or body.\n       - Safe.\n   - So, after eating (4,3), can safely eat (4,4) by moving U.\n\nThis seems like a high-reward sequence with no immediate dangers.\n\n### Comparing with Moving Up First\n\nIf we move Up first to (6,4):\n\nNext moves to reach (4,4):\n\n1. U to (6,4)\n   - Body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n   - Tail: (4,2)\n2. Then L to (5,4)\n   - (5,4) is safe.\n   - Body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ...]\n   - Tail: (4,1)\n3. Then L to (4,4)\n   - (4,4) is food (value 7).\n   - Eat it: length increases by 1.\n   - New body: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ...]\n   - Tail: (4,1)\n   - Next moves from (4,4):\n     - Cannot go R (reverse of L).\n     - U to (4,5): \n       - Check walls: (4,5) is an internal obstacle → collision.\n     - D to (4,3):\n       - (4,3) is food (value 10), but life_span is 1, so by turn 39 it's gone (assuming it appeared at turn 37, disappears after turn 37 + 1 = 38).\n       - If we're at turn 39, it's gone.\n       - But if we're at turn 38, it's still there.\n       - Assuming we're at turn 39 after these moves, it's gone.\n       - So (4,3) is empty.\n       - Is (4,3) in body? \n         - Current body: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]\n         - (4,3) is not in body → safe.\n     - L to (3,4):\n       - Check walls: (3,4) is not a wall or body.\n       - Safe.\n   - So after eating (4,4), can move D to (4,3), but no food there now.\n\nThis path only gets the food at (4,4) (value 7), whereas the Left-first path gets both (4,3) (10) and (4,4) (7).\n\n### Decision\n\nThe Left-first path yields higher total reward (10 + 7 = 17) compared to the Up-first path (7). Also, the Left-first path is safe upon verification.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(4,3) is not in the body.\n   - Up (U) to (5,4): Not in body.\n   - Down (D) to (5,2): Not in body.\n   \nSo, possible moves: Left (L), Up (U), Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**1. Left (L) to (4,3)**:\n   - (4,3) has food with value=9, life_span=1.\n   - Eating this food:\n     - Reward: +1 (since value is positive).\n     - Length increases by 1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: \n       - Current tail is at (4,2).\n       - After eating, new tail will be at (4,2) (since the tail moves forward, but the snake grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move).\n       - New head at (4,3), new body: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)].\n       - Is head adjacent to tail? (4,3) and (4,2) are adjacent (directly below).\n       - Tail has no food (since food is at (4,3) which is now the head), so no danger from Tail Reward.\n   - However, the food at (4,3) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n   - This seems like a good move to get the high-value food.\n\n**2. Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - No food here.\n   - Next moves would need to be considered, but currently no immediate reward.\n\n**3. Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n   - No food here.\n   - Similar to Up, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food at (4,4)\n\nThe other food is at (4,4), value=7, life_span=1.\n- To reach (4,4) from (5,3), possible paths:\n  - Left to (4,3), then Up to (4,4).\n    - But after Left to (4,3), the food at (4,3) is eaten, and the snake grows.\n    - Then next move Up to (4,4) is possible unless the body blocks.\n    - But the food at (4,4) will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), so cannot reach it in one move from (5,3).\n  - Up to (5,4), then Left to (4,4).\n    - But (5,4) to (4,4) is Left, which would be opposite to current direction (if we moved Up first, then Left is allowed).\n    - But again, food at (4,4) disappears after this turn, so cannot reach in one move.\n\nThus, cannot eat (4,4) this turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Left (L) to (4,3) to eat the high-value food (value=9) before it disappears, and there are no immediate dangers (no body collision, no wall, no tail reward danger).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough:\n- After moving Left to (4,3), the snake will be:\n  - Head: (4,3)\n  - Body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n- Tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent to head (4,3).\n- But Tail Reward Danger only applies if the tail cell has positive food.\n  - Currently, tail is at (4,2), which has no food.\n  - The food was at (4,3), which is now the head.\n- So no danger.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes, the best immediate action is to move Left to eat the high-value food at (4,3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the last move was from (5,3) to (4,3).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There is one piece of food at (4,4) with:\n     - Value: +1 (positive food)\n     - Life Span: 6 turns (including the current turn, so it will disappear after turn 44)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- **Head**: (4,3)\n- **Adjacent Cells to Head**:\n  - Up (U): (4,4) - Food is here.\n  - Down (D): (4,2) - Part of the snake's body (tail segment).\n  - Left (L): (3,3) - Need to check if this is a wall or safe.\n  - Right (R): (5,3) - Part of the snake's body (next segment after head).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n   - Contains positive food.\n   - Need to check if eating this food is safe.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,3)\n   - Need to check if this cell is a wall or safe.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,3)\n   - This is the body segment immediately after the head. Moving right would cause the head to collide with the body, which is deadly.\n   - **Cannot move Right**.\n\nAdditionally, since the last move was Left, we cannot move Right (opposite direction) in the next move, but Right is already invalid due to body collision.\n\n### Checking Move Validity\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - **Food Check**: (4,4) has positive food with value +1.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: After eating, the snake's length increases by 1. The current tail is at (4,2). After moving up:\n     - New head: (4,4)\n     - Body: (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)\n     - New tail will be (5,1) because the tail moves forward (the segment at (4,2) is no longer the tail; the new tail is the second last segment before the addition).\n     - Is (4,4) adjacent to the new tail? The new tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (4,4) (distance is more than 1). So no immediate collision.\n   - **Body Collision**: (4,4) is not part of the current snake body.\n   - **Wall Check**: (4,4) is not a wall.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up and eat the food.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - **Wall Check**: Is (3,3) a wall?\n     - Internal walls include (3,2), (3,6), (3,1). (3,3) is not listed.\n     - Border walls: x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7. (3,3) is within borders.\n     - **Not a wall**.\n   - **Body Collision**: Is (3,3) part of the snake's body?\n     - Current body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). (3,3) is not in this list.\n     - **Safe**.\n   - **Food**: No food at (3,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Left, but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - **Body Collision**: (4,2) is part of the snake's body (tail segment).\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if the tail is the immediate next segment.\n     - Current tail is (4,2). After moving down:\n       - New head: (4,2)\n       - Body: (4,3), (5,3), ..., (5,1)\n       - The segment that was at (4,2) moves to where the head was, so the new tail is (4,1).\n       - But the head is now at (4,2), which was the old tail's position. Since the tail moves away, this is safe unless the head and new tail collide, which they don't immediately.\n     - However, the segment at (4,2) is the last segment, and moving into it is generally safe unless it's the only segment (which it's not here).\n     - **But** looking at the snake's positions: [(4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)], moving to (4,2) would place the head where the tail is, and the tail moves to (4,1), so no immediate collision.\n   - **Food**: No food at (4,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Down, but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nBetween the possible safe moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Eat positive food at (4,4), increasing length by 1.\n   - Benefits: Increases score, no immediate danger.\n   - Risks: Need to ensure that after eating, the new head position doesn't lead to a trap.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (3,3), no immediate benefit but safe.\n   - Benefits: Keeps options open for future moves.\n   - Risks: Misses the opportunity to score.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (4,2), no benefit.\n   - Benefits: None.\n   - Risks: None immediate, but not productive.\n\nGiven that moving Up allows us to eat positive food safely, and the other moves don't provide immediate benefits, **Up is the best choice**.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne critical rule is the **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (4,2).\n- Head is at (4,3), so adjacent to tail (since (4,3) and (4,2) are vertically adjacent).\n- However, the food is at (4,4), not at the tail. The tail does not have food.\n- Therefore, this rule does not apply here, and eating the food at (4,4) is safe.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions After Moving Up\n\nAfter moving Up to (4,4):\n- New head: (4,4)\n- New body: (4,3), (5,3), ..., (4,2)\n- Length increases by 1, so the tail remains at (5,1) (since the last segment before addition was (4,2), and the new tail is the segment before that).\n- Check if (4,4) is adjacent to (5,1):\n  - Distance: |4-5| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent.\n- No immediate collision.\n\n### Considering Future Moves After Eating\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), the snake's length increases, and the next moves need to be considered to avoid trapping oneself. However, since we're only deciding the immediate action, ensuring that the current move is safe is sufficient.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to eat the positive food at (4,4), as it is safe and increases the score.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n     - Head at (4,4), next segment at (4,3), and so on, with tail at (4,2).\n   - Current direction: U (Up, meaning the head is moving in the positive y-direction).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item: (6, 3, 10, 1)\n     - Position: (6,3)\n     - Value: 10 (positive food, so eating it increases length by 1 and score by 1)\n     - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand possible moves:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Adjacent body segments:\n  - Next segment is at (4,3), which is directly below the head (since direction is U, meaning the snake was moving up to reach (4,4) from (4,3)).\n\nPossible moves from (4,4) (current head) without reversing (cannot go D because current direction is U):\n- U: (4,5)\n- L: (3,4)\n- R: (5,4)\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check for walls/obstacles: \n     - (4,5) is not a border wall (y=7 is the top border).\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is listed as an obstacle. Cannot move here.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check for walls/obstacles:\n     - Not a border wall (x=0 is left border).\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (3,6) are obstacles, but (3,4) is not listed.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n     - (3,4) is not in the body.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Food at (6,3): Not relevant for this move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check for walls/obstacles:\n     - Not a border wall (x=7 is right border).\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,5), (4,6), etc., but (5,4) is not listed.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (5,4) is not in the body.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Food at (6,3): Not directly relevant unless moving towards it.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe food is at (6,3) with a life span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,4). To reach (6,3):\n- From (4,4), possible moves are L to (3,4), R to (5,4), U is blocked.\n- From (5,4), next move could be R to (6,4), then D to (6,3), but that's two moves away, and food disappears after this turn.\n- From (3,4), moving towards (6,3) would be even less direct.\n\nThus, it's impossible to reach the food at (6,3) in this turn from (4,4). Therefore, the food's presence doesn't influence the immediate move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (3,2), (5,2), (4,1), (4,3).\n   - (3,2) and (4,1) are obstacles.\n   - (5,2): not occupied by snake or walls.\n   - (4,3): is the second segment of the snake.\n- Head is at (4,4), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is |4-4| + |4-2| = 2, not 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger in current position.\n\n### Deciding Between Valid Moves: L or R\n\nBoth L to (3,4) and R to (5,4) are valid. Let's see which is better:\n\n1. **Move Left to (3,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,4):\n     - Current direction would be L (since we moved left).\n     - Cannot move R (reverse).\n     - Possible: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n     - (3,5): check obstacles - (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed. Not a border. Body will have moved, so need to check new body positions.\n     - (3,3): not an obstacle, not in body (current body is (4,4) will be new head, rest shifts).\n     - (2,4): not an obstacle, not in body.\n\n2. **Move Right to (5,4)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4):\n     - Current direction R.\n     - Cannot move L.\n     - Possible: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4).\n       - (5,5): not obstacle, not in body.\n       - (5,3): is part of current body (third segment), but by the time we move, the body would have shifted. Current body after move:\n         - New head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), etc.\n         - So (5,3) is the fourth segment, not adjacent to new head (5,4)'s possible moves.\n       - (6,4): not obstacle, not in body.\n\nBoth moves seem safe. Since the food is not reachable this turn, and both moves are equally safe, we can choose either. \n\nHowever, moving right to (5,4) might be slightly better because:\n- It moves the snake towards the center, giving more space to maneuver in future turns.\n- Moving left to (3,4) is closer to some obstacles like (3,2), (3,1), etc., which might limit future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to go **Right (R)** to (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's break down the current state of the Snake game to decide the best immediate action for Turn 41.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)].\n     - Head at (5,4), moving Right (R).\n     - Tail at (4,1).\n   - Current direction: Right (R), so last move was to the right (from (4,4) to (5,4)).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food at (6,3) with value=9, life_span=1.\n     - Value is positive (+9), so eating it is beneficial.\n     - Life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves and Their Consequences\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4) moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n\nBut we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (L) because that would reverse the current Right (R) direction.\n- **Wall and obstacle collisions**:\n  - Up (U) to (5,5): Check if (5,5) is a wall or obstacle.\n    - Border walls: y=7 is top, so y=5 is safe.\n    - Internal obstacles: (5,5) is not listed, so safe.\n  - Down (D) to (5,3): \n    - (5,3) is part of the snake's body (4th segment in the list). Moving here would collide with the body.\n  - Right (R) to (6,4):\n    - (6,4): Not a border wall (x=7 is wall, x=6 is safe).\n    - Not listed as an internal obstacle.\n    - Not part of the snake's body (only up to (6,3) is body).\n  \nSo, possible safe moves: Up (U) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThere's food at (6,3):\n- Current head is at (5,4). To reach (6,3), the head would need to move Right to (6,4), then Down to (6,3) next turn.\n- But the food's life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. We cannot reach it in this turn; it's adjacent diagonally, not directly.\n- Therefore, we cannot eat this food this turn; it will disappear regardless of our move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that's adjacent to the head:\n- Tail is at (4,1). Adjacent cells to head (5,4) are:\n  - (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n  - (4,1) is not adjacent to (5,4), so no danger here.\n\n### Choosing Between Up and Right\n\nNow, decide between Up (U) and Right (R):\n\n1. **Right (R) to (6,4)**:\n   - Next turn, possible moves from (6,4):\n     - Up to (6,5)\n     - Down to (6,3) (but (6,3) is currently part of the body, but the tail is moving, so need to see if it's still there next turn).\n     - Left to (5,4) (reverse, but current move is R, so next can't be L unless we change direction now).\n     - Right to (7,4) (x=7 is wall, so invalid).\n   - Currently, (6,3) is body, but the tail is at (4,1). After moving right, the tail moves from (4,1) to (?,?), but the body segments shift:\n     - New positions after moving R to (6,4):\n       - Head: (6,4)\n       - Body: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n       - Tail was (4,1), now the segment before it moves to (4,1), so tail is at (5,1).\n     - So (6,3) is still part of the body next turn (it's the 5th segment now), so moving Down to (6,3) next turn would collide.\n   - So from (6,4), possible next moves: Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4) (but Left is reverse of current R, so only if we change direction now).\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n   - Next turn, from (5,5), possible moves:\n     - Up to (5,6)\n     - Down to (5,4) (reverse, but current move is U, so next can't be D unless we change direction now).\n     - Left to (4,5) (internal obstacle, so invalid).\n     - Right to (6,5)\n   - So possible next moves: Up or Right.\n\nComparing both:\n- Moving Right leads to a position where next turn's options are limited (only Up or Left, with Left being reverse which may not be allowed unless we change direction now).\n- Moving Up gives more options next turn (Up or Right).\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After Up to (5,5), next turn can go Up to (5,6) or Right to (6,5).\n  - (5,6): Then can go Up to (5,7) (but y=7 is wall), Left to (4,6) (obstacle), Right to (6,6).\n    - So only Right to (6,6).\n  - (6,5): Then can go Up to (6,6), Left to (5,5) (reverse), Right to (7,5) (wall).\n    - So Up or Left (but Left is reverse).\n\nAlternatively, moving Right now to (6,4), then next turn Left to (5,4) (reverse) or Up to (6,5).\n  - Left to (5,4): Then can go Up to (5,5), Down to (5,3) (body), Right to (6,4) (reverse), Left to (4,4).\n    - So Up or Left.\n  - Up to (6,5): Then as above.\n\nBoth seem similarly constrained, but moving Up now avoids potential immediate dead ends.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nFrom (5,4):\n- Moving Right to (6,4): safe.\n- Moving Up to (5,5): safe.\nNo immediate collisions in either.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince we cannot eat the food this turn (it's at (6,3) and we can't reach it in one move), and both Up and Right are safe, but Up seems to offer slightly better future options:\n\n**Choose Up (U)** to (5,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

From the list, no, it's not.\n     - Body collision: Snake body segments are at (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). (5,6) is not in this list.\n   - Food: No food at (5,6).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is left border, (4,5) is within bounds.\n     - Internal walls: Check if (4,5) is an internal wall. From the list, (4,5) is not listed.\n     - Body collision: Is (4,5) in the body? No.\n   - Food: No food at (4,5).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is right border, (6,5) is within bounds.\n     - Internal walls: (6,5) is not listed.\n     - Body collision: Is (6,5) in the body? No.\n   - Food: No food at (6,5).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering the Food at (6,3)\n\nThe food at (6,3) is positive (+1 score, +1 length) with a life span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\nCurrently, the snake's body occupies (6,3) (part of the body). According to the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (i.e., the segment at (6,3) moves), and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell (6,3).\n\nCurrently, the segment at (6,3) is part of the body (not the tail). The tail is at (5,1). \n\nTo eat the food at (6,3), the head would need to move to (6,3), but currently, (6,3) is occupied by the body (not the tail), so moving there would cause a collision (head touches body segment), which is deadly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot eat the food at (6,3) this turn because it's under a body segment that isn't the tail, and moving there would cause a collision.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Head is at (5,5). Adjacent cells to the tail are (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2). Head is not adjacent to the tail, so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat the food at (6,3) safely this turn, and none of the possible moves lead to immediate food, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it better for future moves.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U to (5,6): Safe, no food.\n- L to (4,5): Safe, no food.\n- R to (6,5): Safe, no food.\n\nAll are equally safe with no immediate reward. However, moving right (R) to (6,5) might be slightly better because:\n- The food at (6,3) will disappear next turn, so no need to consider it further.\n- Moving right keeps the snake closer to the center, giving more options in future moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving left (L) to (4,5) is also safe and keeps options open.\n\nGiven that all moves are equally safe with no immediate benefit, we can choose any. Let's choose Right (R) to (6,5).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest immediate action is to move Right (R).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The distance is more than 1, so no danger.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,4)\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a border wall, and (6,4) is not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check body: (6,4) is not in the snake's body.\n   - No food at (6,4).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,5)\n   - Current direction is R, so moving L is opposite (instant reverse), which is not allowed.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,5)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall → collision, so cannot move here.\n\nSo, possible valid moves are U and D.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThere are two food items:\n\n1. (6,3):\n   - Current position: (6,3) is part of the snake's body (6th segment).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away first, then the head moves onto it. Not possible in one move.\n   - Life_span=1: It will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But since we can't eat it this turn, it will disappear.\n2. (6,6):\n   - Accessible by moving U this turn.\n   - Value=10, life_span=1: Will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger for (6,6)\n\nThe tail is at (6,1). The head is at (6,5). After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail would be the second last segment, which is (6,2). The new head would be at (6,6), which is not adjacent to (6,2) (distance is 4 in y-direction). So no danger.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- Moving D to (6,4) is safe but doesn't eat food.\n- Moving U to (6,6) eats high-value food (10) before it disappears.\n- No immediate threats or collisions from moving U.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the high-value food at (6,6) before it disappears, as it provides the highest reward (+10) and is safe.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls): \n     - (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2), (4,6), (2,3), (2,5)\n     - These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): \n     - Head: (6,6)\n     - Body: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n   - Current direction: U (Up, meaning the head is moving towards increasing y-coordinate).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item: (6,3) with value=6 and life_span=1.\n     - This means the food is at (6,3), gives +6 score, increases length by 1, and will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases to 0 next turn).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is U, so cannot move D next.\n- **Valid moves**: U, L, R (since D is opposite of U).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: (x,y) -> (6,6+1) = (6,7)\n   - Check if (6,7) is valid:\n     - y=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (x,y) -> (6-1,6) = (5,6)\n   - Check if (5,6) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not in border walls, and (5,6) is not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: \n       - Snake body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n       - (5,6) is not in this list.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - **Food consideration**: No food at (5,6).\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (x,y) -> (6+1,6) = (7,6)\n   - Check if (7,6) is valid:\n     - x=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5,6).\n\n### Considering the Food at (6,3)\n\nThe food at (6,3) is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the 7th segment: (6,3)). \n\nTo eat this food:\n1. The body must move away from (6,3).\n2. The head must move onto (6,3).\n\nCurrently, the head is at (6,6). To reach (6,3), the snake would need to move down multiple times, but:\n- Current direction is U, so next move cannot be D (instant reverse is not allowed).\n- Even if we could move D, it would take multiple moves to reach (6,3), and the food's life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So, it's impossible to eat this food in the current turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe tail is at (6,1). The head is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to the tail (adjacent would be same x or y with difference of 1). So, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5,6), which is safe:\n- Not a wall.\n- Not part of the body.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- Cannot eat the food at (6,3) this turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The body moves away (i.e., the segment occupying (6,3) moves), and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell (6,3).\n\nGiven that the food's life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent head direction is Left (L), so the snake was moving left in the previous turn. The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: Move to (4,6)\n   - Check if (4,6) is a wall or body:\n     - Walls: x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7, and internal obstacles include (4,6) → (4,6) is a wall. **Invalid move**.\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (5,7)\n   - (5,7): y=7 is a border wall. **Invalid move**.\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (5,5)\n   - (5,5): Check if it's body or wall.\n     - Snake body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ... → (5,5) is the 3rd body segment. **Collision with body**. **Invalid move**.\n4. **Reverse Right (R)**: Opposite of current direction (L). \n   - From the rules: \"No instant reverse\". Since the last move was L, moving R is not allowed. **Invalid move**.\n\n### Dead End Situation\n\nAll possible immediate moves from the current position and direction are invalid:\n- Left: wall\n- Up: wall\n- Down: body collision\n- Right: reverse not allowed\n\nThis means the snake cannot make a valid move without colliding or hitting a wall, leading to a game over.\n\n### Re-evaluating Food Consumption\n\nIs there a way to eat the food at (6,3) to possibly extend the game?\n\nThe food is under the body at (6,3). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (6,3).\n   - The tail is at (6,2), and the segment before it is at (6,3). \n   - Next move, the tail will move from (6,2) to where the next segment moves, but (6,3) is occupied by the 8th segment, which moves based on the head's movement.\n   - However, since the head cannot move without causing a collision or hitting a wall, the body cannot move away from (6,3) in this turn.\n2. The head must move onto (6,3).\n   - Even if we could move the head to (6,3), it's currently occupied by the body, and we can't move the body away first due to the above.\n\nThus, eating the food is impossible in this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that all possible moves lead to a collision or wall hit, and the food cannot be eaten under the current constraints, the snake has no valid moves left. \n\nHowever, since the task is to provide an immediate action, and all moves are invalid, the only possible action is to attempt a move that might seem least harmful, even though it leads to a collision. But in reality, any move would result in a game over.\n\nGiven that, the most \"correct\" action based on rules is to choose one, even if it's invalid, but since all are invalid, perhaps the system expects us to choose one that's not a reverse.\n\nBetween Left (wall), Up (wall), and Down (body), Down is into the body, which is a collision, same as others. \n\nBut since the snake must move, and all moves are fatal, the answer is to choose one, perhaps the one that's not a reverse, which is Down.\n\nBut actually, the only non-reverse moves are Left, Up, Down, all invalid. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the system expects us to choose one, so let's choose Down.\n\nHowever, looking back, the food is at (6,3), which is part of the body. The tail is at (6,2), and the segment before tail is at (6,3). \n\nIf we could move the head to (6,6) (but that's reverse), or (5,7) (wall), or (5,5) (body), or (4,6) (wall). \n\nNo possible move.\n\nGiven that, the only possible move is to continue left into the wall, as it's not a reverse.\n\nBut left is into (4,6), which is a wall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the head can move to (5,5), even though it's body, but the tail is moving away from (6,2), but (5,5) is the 3rd segment, so collision.\n\nThus, no valid move.\n\nBut the system requires an answer, so perhaps the answer is to move left into the wall.\n\n\\boxed{L}",
