        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant note: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\n- When the player moves (U, D, or S), the position update happens at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T which will determine y_{T+1}.\n\n- The key is: at the moment of being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at turn T, we must check that for that freeway row, at turn T, no car has a span that includes 0.\n\n- If we move from row A to row B at turn T, then at turn T we are still on row A. Only at turn T+1 we will be on row B.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n\nFor a car on a freeway at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s, then at a future turn T (>= t1), the car's span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: the given cars are all right-moving (from the data). So:\n\nRight-moving: the span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table: for a right-moving car, the head is the larger x? Actually, the table says for right-moving: \n  initial Span(t1) = [tau, h]? But wait, the table lists (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLooking at the table: \n  For freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> so head=-48, tail=-59? That would be from -59 to -48? But that is moving right? Actually, if head is at -48 and tail at -59, then the car is from -59 to -48? But then when moving right, the entire car moves to the right.\n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving says:\n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo if head is h and tail is tau, then the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (if tau <= h). But in the data, we have for freeway 1: \n  (-48, -59, right, 4): so h=-48, tau=-59 -> then the initial span is [-59, -48]. Then at turn T, it becomes:\n  [ -59 + 4*(T-12), -48 + 4*(T-12) ]\n\nSimilarly, the other cars.\n\nWe are starting at turn 12, and we are at (0,0). We want to go to (0,9). We can only move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But note: we start at y=0, and we want to get to y=9, so we must go up. However, we have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car at x=0 at the same turn.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to simulate the player moving upward (mostly) and check at each turn on which row we are and whether that row (if it's between 1 and 8) has a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are at turn 12: y=0 -> safe because freeways are 1-8, and y=0 is safe.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible. The minimal steps without cars would be 9 steps (each step up: U). But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nSo we must check for each freeway row we step on, at the turn we are on that row, that no car on that row at that turn has span covering 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet t start at 12 (current turn). We are at y0 = 0 (at t=12).\n\nWe choose actions for t=12, t=13, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible, but if going up would lead to a collision, we might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid, but note that going down from y=0 is not allowed (y must be in [0,9]) and we are at 0 so we cannot go below 0. Similarly, we are going to 9 so we don't want to go down unless necessary.\n\nBut note: we can only change by -1,0,1 per turn. So we must traverse each row from 0 to 9.\n\nWe are going to check for each row from 1 to 8, at the turn when we are on that row, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and for each car, the times (turns) at which the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial (at turn 12) head h, tail tau, direction right, speed s:\n\nThe car covers x=0 at a turn T if and only if:\n  tau + s*(T-12) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-12)\n\nBut note: in the representation, for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the head is the larger x? In the example: (-48, -59, right, 4): \n  head = -48, tail = -59 -> so the car is from -59 to -48. Then when moving right, the entire segment moves to the right.\n\nSo at time T, the car is at [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] = [-59 + 4*(T-12), -48 + 4*(T-12)]\n\nWe need 0 to be in [A, B] where A = -59 + 4*(T-12) and B = -48 + 4*(T-12).\n\nSo:\n  A <= 0 <= B\n  => -59 + 4*(T-12) <= 0 <= -48 + 4*(T-12)\n\nSolve:\n  -59 + 4*(T-12) <= 0  => 4*(T-12) <= 59  => T-12 <= 59/4 = 14.75 => T <= 26.75 -> T <= 26 (since T integer)\n  0 <= -48 + 4*(T-12) => 4*(T-12) >= 48 => T-12 >= 12 => T>=24\n\nSo for this car, T must be in [24, 26].\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every car.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nSo we must do for each freeway and each car on that freeway.\n\nWe'll create a set of \"bad\" (freeway, turn) pairs for which at that turn, that freeway has a car at x=0.\n\nBut note: multiple cars on the same freeway: we only need to know if at least one car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 12) whether the freeway k has a car that covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 12 until we reach 9. Since the minimal steps without obstacles is 9, we might need a few more. We'll try to find the minimal H.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS or Dijkstra? But the state is (turn, y) and we want minimal turns. Since we can only move one step per turn, we can do a BFS in the state (y, turn) but note turn can go high? We want minimal H so we can use BFS and stop when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, after a while the cars will have passed, so we can compute.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the bad events for each freeway and for a range of turns, say from turn 12 to turn 12+50 (we hope we don't take more than 50 turns).\n\nLet's precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the turns T (>=12) at which the car covers 0.\n\nFreeway 1:\n  Cars: \n    car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> [24,26] as above.\n    car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> \n        Condition: \n          -23 + 4*(T-12) <= 0 <= -12 + 4*(T-12)\n          => -23 + 4*(T-12) <= 0 => 4*(T-12) <= 23 => T-12 <= 5.75 => T<=17.75 -> T<=17\n          0 <= -12 + 4*(T-12) => 4*(T-12)>=12 => T-12>=3 => T>=15\n        So T in [15,17]\n\n    car3: (24,13,right,4) -> \n          13 + 4*(T-12) <= 0 <= 24 + 4*(T-12) -> \n          But 13 + 4*(T-12) <=0 -> 4*(T-12)<=-13 -> T-12<=-3.25 -> T<=8.75 -> but T>=12 -> no solution? \n          Actually, at T=12: the car is at [13,24] -> which is positive, so 0 is not covered. And as time increases, it moves to the right, so never covers 0? So no bad turn.\n\nSo freeway 1 has bad turns: \n  from car1: [24,26]\n  from car2: [15,17]\n  So overall: {15,16,17,24,25,26}\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  The table says: same cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4) -> same as freeway1 -> bad turns: {15,16,17,24,25,26}\n\nFreeway 3:\n  Cars:\n    (48,37,right,6) -> \n        37 + 6*(T-12) <= 0 <= 48 + 6*(T-12)\n        First: 37+6*(T-12) <=0 -> 6*(T-12)<=-37 -> T-12<=-37/6≈-6.16 -> impossible.

We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But we start at 0, so down is not allowed (we'd go to -1 which is invalid). So at turn 12, we can only choose U or S.\n\nWe'll simulate the path. We want the minimal H so we try to go up as fast as possible, but if we are going to step on a freeway at a bad turn, we must avoid.\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\nState: (turn, y)\n\nWe start at (12,0). We want to reach (turn,9) for some turn.\n\nWe consider the actions: U, D, S. But note: if y=0, D is invalid. Similarly, at y=9, U would be invalid? But we stop when we reach y=9.\n\nWe simulate:\n\nWe'll keep a queue of (turn, y, path) and also we mark visited states to avoid cycles? But since we are going upward and we want minimal turns, we can use the turn count and y: if we have a state (turn, y) and we can get to the same state with a lower turn? Actually, we are moving forward in time. We want minimal total turns, so we can use Dijkstra (with time as cost) or BFS by time.\n\nWe do BFS in increasing turn order.\n\nWe note that the bad events are only at specific turns and freeways. When we are at (turn, y) and y is between 1 and 8, we check if (y, turn) is a bad pair? i.e., if for freeway y, the turn is in the bad set we precomputed.\n\nIf it is, then we cannot be at that freeway at that turn -> collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nWe start:\n\nTurn 12: at y=0 -> safe.\n\nFrom (12,0), we can do:\n  a12 = U: then at turn13, y=1 -> but at turn13, we are at freeway1. Check: freeway1 bad turns: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 13 not in there -> safe.\n  a12 = S: then at turn13, y=0 -> safe.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we prefer to go up.\n\nWe'll try to go up as much as possible.\n\nLet me try the direct path: always U until 9.\n\nTurn 12: y0=0 -> choose U -> turn13: y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe (turn13 not bad for freeway1)\nTurn13: at y=1 -> choose U -> turn14: y=2 (freeway2) -> at turn14: freeway2 bad turns: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 14 not bad -> safe.\nTurn14: at y=2 -> choose U -> turn15: y=3 (freeway3) -> at turn15: freeway3 bad turns: {16,17} -> 15 not bad -> safe? \nBut wait: we are at freeway3 at turn15 -> bad set for freeway3: {16,17} -> 15 is not included -> safe.\n\nTurn15: at y=3 -> choose U -> turn16: y=4 (freeway4) -> at turn16: freeway4 bad turns: {16,17} -> 16 is included -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot do U at turn15 because that would put us at freeway4 at turn16, which is bad.\n\nSo at turn15 (when at y=3), we cannot go up. We can choose S or D.\n\nIf we choose S: then at turn16, we stay at y=3 -> but at turn16, we are at freeway3? \n  At turn16: we are at freeway3 -> bad set for freeway3: {16,17} -> 16 is bad -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot stay at y=3 at turn16.\n\nThen we must go down? \n  D: then at turn16, we go to y=2 (freeway2) -> at turn16: freeway2 bad turns: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 16 is bad -> collision.\n\nSo at turn15 (at y=3), we have no safe action? That cannot be. \n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nAt turn15, we are at freeway3? Actually, we are at y=3 at turn15 -> that is freeway3? Yes.\n\nBut the bad set for freeway3 is {16,17} -> meaning at turn16 and 17, freeway3 has a car? But at turn15, freeway3 does not have a car? So we are safe at turn15.\n\nThen at turn15, we choose an action that determines where we are at turn16.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway that is bad at the same turn.\n\nSo at turn15, we are at y=3 (freeway3) and we are safe because turn15 is not bad for freeway3.\n\nBut then we choose an action at turn15:\n\n  If we choose U: then at turn16 we are at y=4 (freeway4). Then at turn16, we are at freeway4 -> and freeway4 bad at turn16? -> yes, because freeway4 bad set: {16,17} -> collision.\n\n  If we choose S: then at turn16 we are at y=3 (freeway3). Then at turn16, we are at freeway3 -> bad set for freeway3: {16,17} -> collision.\n\n  If we choose D: then at turn16 we are at y=2 (freeway2). Then at turn16, freeway2 is bad -> collision.\n\nSo indeed, from y=3 at turn15, we cannot do any action? That would mean we are stuck.\n\nBut that cannot be the case because we can wait at a safe row until the bad time passes.\n\nBut note: we are at turn15 at y=3, and we must leave at turn15? But we cannot leave to a safe row at turn16 because all adjacent rows (2,3,4) are bad at turn16? \n\nWait, what about freeway1? At turn16, freeway1 is bad (because bad set:15,16,17) -> so y=1 is bad at turn16.\nFreeway2: bad at turn16.\nFreeway3: bad at turn16.\nFreeway4: bad at turn16.\nFreeway5: bad at turn14 only -> so at turn16, freeway5 is safe? But freeway5 is row5.\n\nSo if we were at row5 at turn16, that would be safe? \n\nBut we are at row3 at turn15. How can we get to row5 at turn16? We can only move one step per turn. So from row3, we can only go to row2,3,4 at turn16.\n\nSo we cannot jump to row5.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at row3 at turn15? \n\nBut how? We came from row2 at turn14 (by going up to row3 at turn15). So we must change our path.\n\nAlternative: at turn14, we are at row2. Instead of going up to row3, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut at turn14, we are at row2 (freeway2). Check: freeway2 bad at turn14? -> bad set: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 14 is safe.\n\nFrom row2 at turn14, we can choose:\n\n  U: to row3 at turn15 -> then we get stuck as above.\n\n  S: stay at row2 at turn15 -> at turn15, freeway2 is bad? -> bad set: {15,16,17} -> yes, 15 is bad -> collision.\n\n  D: to row1 at turn15 -> at turn15, freeway1 is bad? -> bad set: {15,16,17} -> 15 is bad -> collision.\n\nSo at turn14, we are forced to go up? But then we get stuck at turn15.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at row2 at turn14.\n\nBut how did we get to row2? From row1 at turn13 by going up.\n\nAt turn13, we are at row1 (freeway1). Bad set for freeway1: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 13 is safe.\n\nFrom row1 at turn13, we can choose:\n\n  U: to row2 at turn14 -> then we get stuck as above.\n\n  S: to row1 at turn14 -> at turn14, freeway1: bad set does not include 14 -> safe? \n        But then at turn14 we are at row1 -> safe.\n\n  D: to row0 at turn14 -> safe (row0 is not a freeway).\n\nSo let's try:\n\nTurn12: U -> turn13: row1\nTurn13: S (stay) -> turn14: row1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn14: not bad)\nThen at turn14, we are at row1. Now what?\n\nAt turn14, we can choose:\n  U: to row2 at turn15 -> freeway2 at turn15: bad set {15,16,17} -> 15 is bad -> collision.\n  S: to row1 at turn15 -> freeway1 at turn15: bad -> collision.\n  D: to row0 at turn15 -> safe.\n\nSo we go down to row0 at turn15.\n\nBut then we are at row0 at turn15. Then we can try again to go up.\n\nBut now we are at turn15 at row0. Then:\n\nTurn15: U -> turn16: row1 -> freeway1 at turn16: bad (because 16 in bad set) -> collision.\n\nTurn15: S -> turn16: row0 -> safe.\n\nTurn15: D -> not allowed.\n\nSo we stay at row0 at turn16.\n\nThen at turn16: we can go U to row1 at turn17 -> freeway1 at turn17: bad? -> 17 is in bad set -> collision.\n\nOr stay: row0 at turn17 -> safe.\n\nBut we are not making progress.\n\nWe need to wait until the bad time for freeway1 is over? The bad time for freeway1 is until 26? That is too long.\n\nWe must find a way to skip the bad rows at the bad times.\n\nNote that freeway5,6,7,8 have very few bad turns.\n\nWe might go up quickly to the higher freeways after the bad turns.\n\nBut note: freeway5 has a bad turn at 14, freeway7 and 8 at 14. So we must avoid row5,7,8 at turn14.\n\nWe are at turn12: row0.\n\nLet me try to wait at row0 for a few turns.\n\nBut we want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to row4 quickly? But row4 is freeway4, which has bad turns at 16,17.\n\nHow about we go up to row0 until turn14 is over? \n\nBut at turn14, the bad freeways are 5,7,8 -> we are at row0, so safe.\n\nThen after turn14, freeway5,7,8 are safe.\n\nBut freeway1,2,3,4 are bad at 15,16,17.\n\nSo we need to get above row4 by turn15? \n\nBut from row0 at turn14, we can go:\n\nTurn14: at row0 -> we can go U to row1 at turn15 -> but row1 at turn15 is bad.\n\nOr we can stay at row0 at turn15 -> safe.\n\nBut we want to get to row9.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip the lower rows by waiting until after the bad events.\n\nBut the bad events for rows1-4 go until turn26? That is too long.\n\nWe must go through rows1-4 during safe times.\n\nLet me list the safe times for each row:\n\nRow1: safe at turns: [12,13,14] and then 27+? (because bad at 15,16,17,24,25,26) -> so safe at turns: 12,13,14,18,19,20,21,22,23,27,...\nRow2: same as row1: safe at same turns: 12,13,14,18,...,23,27,...\nRow3: safe at: bad at 16,17 -> so safe at: 12,13,14,15,18,19,... \nRow4: same as row3: safe at 12,13,14,15,18,19,...\n\nRow5: bad only at 14 -> safe at 12,13,15,16,17,18,...\nRow6: always safe.\nRow7: bad at 14 -> safe at 12,13,15,16,...\nRow8: bad at 14 -> safe at 12,13,15,16,...\n\nWe want to traverse from row0 to row9, passing rows1 to8.\n\nWe are at turn12 at row0.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe can try to go up as much as possible during safe times.\n\nLet me try:\n\nTurn12: U -> row1 at turn13 (safe: row1 safe at 13? yes, because 13 is in [12,14])\n\nTurn13: U -> row2 at turn14 (row2 safe at 14? yes)\n\nTurn14: U -> row3 at turn15 (row3 safe at 15? yes, because row3 bad at 16,17 -> 15 is safe)\n\nTurn15: U -> row4 at turn16 (row4 at turn16: bad -> not safe)\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn15.\n\nAt turn15, we are at row3 (safe). What can we do?\n\nWe want to avoid row4 at turn16 (which is bad) and also row3 at turn16 is bad, row2 at turn16 is bad, row1 at turn16 is bad.\n\nThe only safe rows at turn16 are rows5,6,7,8? \n  row5: safe at 16? yes (after 14)\n  row6: safe\n  row7: safe\n  row8: safe\n\nBut we are at row3 at turn15. How to get to row5 at turn16? We need to move up by 2 in one turn? Impossible.\n\nSo we cannot reach row5 at turn16 from row3.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at row3 at turn15. We must be at row4 at turn15? But how?\n\nAt turn14, we were at row2. We could have chosen to go up twice? No, one step per turn.\n\nAt turn14, we are at row2. We could go up to row3 at turn15, but we just saw that leads to a problem.\n\nAt turn14, we could do something else.\n\nFrom turn14 at row2: \n  Instead of U to row3 at turn15, we could go down to row1 at turn15? \n      at turn15: row1 is bad -> collision.\n\n  Or stay at row2 at turn15: row2 at turn15 is bad -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at row2 at turn14 either.\n\nThen we must avoid being at row2 at turn14.\n\nHow? At turn13, we were at row1. Instead of going up to row2 at turn14, we could have stayed or gone down.\n\nIf at turn13: \n  S: then at turn14, we are at row1 -> safe (row1 safe at 14) \n  D: to row0 at turn14 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are at row1 or row0 at turn14.\n\nThen we have to wait until after the bad times for the lower rows? The next safe window for rows1-4 is from turn18 to 23.\n\nSo we can wait at row0 or row1 until turn18.\n\nBut that would take many turns.\n\nWe want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go to row5 or above at a safe time.\n\nNote that row5 is safe at turn15 (since bad only at 14).\n\nBut to be at row5 at turn15, we must come from row4 or row6 at turn14.\n\nAt turn14, we are currently at row0,1, or2? \n\nWe are at turn12: row0.\n\nTurn12: U -> turn13: row1.\n\nTurn13: U -> turn14: row2.\n\nThen from row2 at turn14, we cannot reach row5 at turn15.\n\nWhat if we go faster initially?\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we start earlier? But we start at turn12 at row0.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row4 by turn15? \n\nTurn12: U -> row1 at13\nTurn13: U -> row2 at14\nTurn14: U -> row3 at15 -> then we can go U at turn15 to row4 at16 -> but row4 at16 is bad.\n\nOr at turn14: from row2, we go U to row3 at15 -> then we are stuck.\n\nWe need to be at row5 at turn15. How?\n\nTo be at row5 at turn15, we must have been at row4,5,or6 at turn14.\n\nAt turn14, we can only be as high as: starting from row0 at turn12, then turn13: row1, turn14: row2 -> we are at row2 at turn14. So we cannot be at row4 at turn14.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at row5 at turn15.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at row6,7,8 at turn15 either.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row5 is turn15+ (steps from row0 to row5 is 5 steps) -> turn12+5 = turn17.\n\nAt turn17, row5 is safe? -> after turn14, row5 is safe -> yes.\n\nSimilarly, row6,7,8 are safe at turn17.\n\nAnd rows1-4: at turn17, row1 and row2 are bad (because 17 in bad set) but rows3 and4: bad set for row3 is {16,17} -> so at turn17, row3 and row4 are bad.\n\nSo at turn17, we can only be on rows5,6,7,8.\n\nSo we want to be at row5 (or higher) by turn17.\n\nHow many turns from turn12 to turn17? 5 turns. We need to go from row0 to row5 in 5 turns -> that is exactly one per turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn12: U -> row1 at13\nTurn13: U -> row2 at14\nTurn14: U -> row3 at15\nTurn15: U -> row4 at16\nTurn16: U -> row5 at17\n\nBut now check the safety:\n\nTurn13: row1 at13 -> safe (row1 safe at13)\nTurn14: row2 at14 -> safe (row2 safe at14)\nTurn15: row3 at15 -> safe (row3 safe at15)\nTurn16: row4 at16 -> row4 is freeway4, and freeway4 bad at16 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nAt turn15, we are at row3. Instead of going up to row4 at16, we could do something else.\n\nBut at turn15, row3 is safe, but then at turn16:\n\n  If we go U: row4 at16 -> bad.\n  S: row3 at16 -> bad.\n  D: row2 at16 -> bad.\n\nSo again stuck.\n\nWe must avoid being at row4 at turn16.\n\nHow about we wait at a lower row until turn16 is over? But then we would be late for getting to row5 by turn17.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at row5 at turn17 without going through row4 at turn16? \n\nBut to get to row5 at turn17, we must have been at row4,5,6 at turn16.\n\nAt turn16, we can be at row5,6,7,8 (safe), but not row4 (bad).\n\nSo we must be at row5,6,7, or8 at turn16.\n\nHow to get to row5 at turn16? \n\nWe must have been at row4,5,6 at turn15.\n\nAt turn15, we can be at row4? But row4 at turn15: freeway4 at turn15 -> bad set: {16,17} -> 15 is safe? -> yes, row4 safe at15.\n\nSo we can be at row4 at turn15.\n\nThen from row4 at turn15: \n  U: row5 at turn16 -> safe (row5 safe at16) -> then at turn16, we are at row5.\n\nThen from there we can continue.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn12: U -> row1 at13 (safe)\nTurn13: U -> row2 at14 (safe)\nTurn14: U -> row3 at15 (safe)\nTurn15: U -> row4 at16 -> wait, at turn15 we choose U: then at turn16 we are at row4? -> but row4 at16 is bad -> collision.\n\nBut we want to be at row4 at turn15, not turn16.\n\nAt turn14: we are at row2. We choose U: then at turn15 we are at row3.\n\nThen at turn15, we choose U: then at turn16 we are at row4 -> bad.\n\nBut we want to be at row4 at turn15. How?\n\nWe need to be at row4 at turn15.\n\nFrom turn14, we are at row2. We can only go to row1,2,3 at turn15.\n\nWe cannot be at row4 at turn15 from row2 at turn14.\n\nUnless we were higher at turn14.\n\nBut at turn14, we are only at row2.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row3 at turn14? \n\nBut how? \n\nTurn12: U -> row1 at13\nTurn13: U -> row2 at14\nThen at turn14, we are at row2.\n\nWe need to be at row3 at turn14? That's not possible because we are at row2 at turn14.\n\nUnless we use more than one step per turn? We cannot.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row4 is turn16: \n  turn12:0->1\n  turn13:1->2\n  turn14:2->3\n  turn15:3->4\n  turn16: at row4 -> but then row4 at turn16 is bad.\n\nSo we cannot be at row4 at a safe time until after turn17? \n\nRow4 safe after turn17: turn18 and beyond.\n\nThen we would be at row4 at turn18.\n\nThen we can go up to row5 at turn19, row6 at20, row7 at21, row8 at22, row9 at23.\n\nThat would be 11 turns (from turn12 to turn23: 11 steps? turn12 to turn23 is 12 turns? Let's count: turn12 is start, then we do 11 actions: turn12,13,...,22 to get to turn23 at row9.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nAlternatively, after turn17, rows1-4 become safe again (until turn24) so we can go through them quickly.\n\nBut we are already at row0 at turn12.\n\nAnother idea: use row6,7,8 which are safe most of the time.\n\nBut we still have to go through rows1-4.\n\nLet me try to avoid the bad turns by waiting at a safe row.\n\nFor example, at turn14, we are at row2. But we cannot stay or move down because they lead to bad rows at turn15.\n\nSo we must be at a row that is safe at turn15 and also safe to be there at turn15.\n\nAt turn15, safe rows are:\n  row0: safe\n  row3: safe (row3 safe at turn15)\n  row4: safe (row4 safe at turn15)\n  row5: safe\n  row6: safe\n  row7: safe\n  row8: safe\n  row9: safe\n  But row1 and row2 are bad.\n\nSo we want to be at row0,3,4,5,6,7,8, or9 at turn15.\n\nHow to get to row3 at turn15 from our path?\n\nWe are at row2 at turn14. We can go up to row3 at turn15 -> that's safe (row3 safe at15).\n\nThen at turn15, we are at row3.\n\nThen at turn16, we need to be at a safe row. Safe rows at turn16: row5,6,7,8 (row0,1,2,3,4 are bad).\n\nSo from row3 at turn15, we want to be at row5 at turn16? Impossible.\n\nOr row6? Impossible.\n\nSo we must be at row3 at turn15 and then at turn16 we are forced to move to row2,3,4 which are all bad.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nHow about at turn14, we are at row2, and we go down to row1 at turn15 -> but row1 at15 is bad.\n\nOr stay at row2 at turn15 -> bad.\n\nSo the only safe choice from row2 at turn14 is to go up to row3 at turn15, but then we get stuck at turn16.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at row2 at turn14.\n\nWe must be at row1 at turn14 and then do something else.\n\nHow to be at row1 at turn14? \n  turn12: U -> row1 at13\n  turn13: S or D -> \n      if S: row1 at14 -> safe.\n      if D: row0 at14 -> safe.\n\nSo let's choose at turn13: S -> then turn14: row1.\n\nAt turn14, we are at row1. Then at turn15, we want to be at a safe row. Safe rows at turn15: row0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom row1 at turn14, we can go:\n  U: to row2 at15 -> bad.\n  S: to row1 at15 -> bad.\n  D: to row0 at15 -> safe.\n\nSo we go down to row0 at turn15.\n\nThen at turn15, we are at row0.\n\nThen at turn16, we can go to row1 at16 -> but row1 at16 is bad.\n\nOr stay at row0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are not progressing.\n\nAt turn16, we can only be at row0 or row1 (from row0 at turn15: U to row1 at16 -> bad, S to row0 at16 -> safe, D not allowed).\n\nSo we are stuck at row0.\n\nWe need to wait until the bad times for row1 and row2 are over? The next safe time for row1 and row2 is turn18.\n\nSo at turn15: at row0, we can wait:\n\n turn15: S -> turn16: row0\n turn16: S -> turn17: row0\n turn17: U -> turn18: row1 (row1 safe at18? -> bad set: up to 17 and then 24, so 18 is safe)\n turn18: U -> row2 at19 (safe)\n turn19: U -> row3 at20 (safe)\n turn20: U -> row4 at21 (safe)\n turn21: U -> row5 at22 (safe)\n turn22: U -> row6 at23 (safe)\n turn23: U -> row7 at24 (row7 safe at24? -> freeway7 bad set: {14} -> safe)\n turn24: U -> row8 at25 (freeway8 at25: bad set for freeway8: only 14 -> safe)\n turn25: U -> row9 at26\n\nTotal turns from turn12 to turn26: 14 actions ( turns 12 to 25 inclusive -> 14 turns).\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAfter turn17, row1 and row2 are safe (until turn24). \n\nBut also, we can try to go faster to the higher rows.\n\nFor example, after turn17, we are at row0. Then:\n\n turn17: U -> row1 at18 (safe)\n turn18: U -> row2 at19 (safe)\n turn19: U -> row3 at20 (safe)\n turn20: U -> row4 at21 (safe)\n turn21: U -> row5 at22 (safe)\n turn22: U -> row6 at23 (safe)\n turn23: U -> row7 at24 (safe)\n turn24: U -> row8 at25 (safe)\n turn25: U -> row9 at26\n\nThat's 14 turns (from turn12 to turn25: actions at 12,13,...,25 -> 14 actions).\n\nBut we are at row0 at turn12. We then did:\n\n turn12: U (1) -> row1 at13\n turn13: S (2) -> row1 at14\n turn14: D (3) -> row0 at15\n turn15: S (4) -> row0 at16\n turn16: S (5) -> row0 at17\n turn17: U (6) -> row1 at18\n turn18: U (7) -> row2 at19\n turn19: U (8) -> row3 at20\n turn20: U (9) -> row4 at21\n turn21: U (10)-> row5 at22\n turn22: U (11)-> row6 at23\n turn23: U (12)-> row7 at24\n turn24: U (13)-> row8 at25\n turn25: U (14)-> row9 at26\n\nSo at turn26, we are at row9.\n\nH = 14.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe could avoid the initial down and save some turns.\n\nAt turn14, we are at row1. Instead of going down to row0 at turn15, can we go up to row2 at turn18? \n\nBut we are at turn14. How to wait? We have to survive turn15 and turn16 and turn17.\n\nAt turn14: at row1. We can:\n  turn14: S -> row1 at15 -> bad.\n  turn14: U -> row2 at15 -> bad.\n  turn14: D -> row0 at15 -> safe.\n\nSo only down is safe.\n\nThen at turn15: at row0. We can:\n  turn15: S -> row0 at16\n  turn16: S -> row0 at17\n  turn17: U -> row1 at18 (safe)\n\nThat's three turns (15,16,17) to wait.\n\nBut is there a way to be at a higher row at turn18 without using more turns? \n\nFor example, if we could be at row2 at turn18, then we save one turn.\n\nHow to be at row2 at turn18? \n  We must be at row1 or row2 or row3 at turn17.\n\nAt turn17, safe rows for row1: turn17 is bad for row1 -> collision.\n           row2: turn17 is bad.\n           row3: turn17 is bad ( because freeway3: bad at16,17) -> collision.\n           row4: freeway4: bad at16,17 -> collision.\n           row5 and above: safe.\n\nSo at turn17, we can only be at row0 or rows5-8.\n\nIf we are at row0 at turn17, then at turn17 we can go U to row1 at18 (safe).\n\nIf we are at row5 at turn17, then we can go down to row4 at18? but row4 at18 is safe (because after turn17, row4 is safe until turn24) -> but then we are at row4, which is below row5, and we want to go up.\n\nBut our goal is to go to row9, so we might not want to go down.\n\nSo the fastest is to be at row0 at turn17 and then go up.\n\nBut can we be at row5 at turn17? \n\nTo be at row5 at turn17, we need 5 steps from row0, so turn12,13,14,15,16,17 -> 6 actions: \n  turn12: U (1) -> row1 at13\n  turn13: U (2) -> row2 at14\n  turn14: U (3) -> row3 at15\n  turn15: U (4) -> row4 at16\n  turn16: U (5) -> row5 at17\n\nBut check safety:\n  turn13: row1 at13 -> safe\n  turn14: row2 at14 -> safe\n  turn15: row3 at15 -> safe\n  turn16: row4 at16 -> bad (freeway4 at16: collision)\n\nSo not safe.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to wait at row0 for turns 15,16,17 and then go up from turn17 onwards.\n\nBut that took 14 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can wait fewer turns by using the upper safe rows earlier.\n\nFor example, after turn14, the next safe turn for row1 and row2 is turn18. So we have to wait until turn18 to be on row1 or row2.\n\nThe earliest we can be at row1 again is turn18.\n\nSo we must spend turns 15,16,17 at row0.\n\nThen we go up from row0 to row1 at turn18.\n\nThen we have to go from row1 to row9, which takes 8 turns: turn18 to row1, then turn19 to row2, ..., turn25 to row8, turn26 to row9.\n\nThat is 8 actions for the ascent, plus the actions we already used:\n\n turns 12: U (1)\n turns 13: S or D? \n     We did at turn13: from row1 (at turn13) we did S to row1 at turn14.\n     then at turn14: D to row0 at15.\n     then turn15: S to row0 at16.\n     turn16: S to row0 at17.\n     turn17: U to row1 at18.\n\nThen from turn18 to turn26: 8 actions (U every turn).\n\nTotal actions: turn12 to turn26 is 15 actions? Let's count the actions:\n\n action at turn12: U\n turn13: S\n turn14: D\n turn15: S\n turn16: S\n turn17: U\n turn18: U\n turn19: U\n ...\n turn25: U -> then at turn26: row9.\n\nSo actions from turn12 to turn25 inclusive: 14 actions.\n\nAnd at turn26, we are at row9.\n\nBut can we avoid the down at turn14? \n\nAt turn14, we are at row1. We have to do an action. The only safe action is D to row0. \n\nIf we could be at a safe haven at turn15 without going down, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: at turn12, don't go up immediately.\n\n turn12: S -> then at turn13: still at row0.\n turn13: U -> row1 at14 (safe)\n turn14: then we are at row1 at14, and we have to do D to row0 at15 to avoid collision.\n\n same as before.\n\n turn12: S\n turn13: S\n turn14: U -> row1 at15 (bad) -> not allowed.\n\n so not helpful.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to use the 14-action path.\n\nBut we can try to optimize the later part.\n\nFrom turn18 onwards, we go up as fast as possible, and that is 8 turns from row1 to row9.\n\nBut we are at row0 at turn17, and we go to row1 at turn18, then row2 at19, ..., row9 at26.\n\n total actions: from turn12 to turn25: 14 actions.\n\nIs there a way to gain one turn? \n\nFor example, if we can be at row2 at turn18, then we save one turn in the ascent.\n\nBut to be at row2 at turn18, we must be at row1,2, or3 at turn17.\n\nAt turn17, row1,2,3,4 are bad. So we cannot be at row2 at turn17.\n\nTherefore, the minimal path is 14 turns.\n\nLet me write the actions:\n\nTurn 12: U   -> (0->1) at turn13\nTurn 13: S   -> (1->1) at turn14\nTurn 14: D   -> (1->0) at turn15  [Note: D from 1 goes to 0]\nTurn 15: S   -> (0->0) at turn16\nTurn 16: S   -> (0->0) at turn17\nTurn 17: U   -> (0->1) at turn18  [now safe for row1]\nTurn 18: U   -> (1->2) at turn19\nTurn 19: U   -> (2->3) at turn20\nTurn 20: U   -> (3->4) at turn21\nTurn 21: U   -> (4->5) at turn22\nTurn 22: U   -> (5->6) at turn23\nTurn 23: U   -> (6->7) at turn24\nTurn 24: U   -> (7->8) at turn25\nTurn 25: U   -> (8->9) at turn26\n\nBut wait, at turn25: we do U from row8 to row9, and at turn26 we are at row9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn25, and at turn26 we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns 12 to 25 (inclusive) -> 14 actions.\n\nAnd H=14.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nPerhaps we can use row6 which is always safe to wait? But we have to go through the lower ones.\n\nAnother idea: after turn14, instead of going down to row0, can we go up to a higher safe row by a different route? \n\nFor example, if we could be at row5 at turn15, then we are safe. But we cannot.\n\nOr at turn16, if we are at row5, we are safe. But to be at row5 at turn16, we need to be at row4 at turn15, and row4 at turn15 is safe, and then U to row5 at turn16.\n\nBut to be at row4 at turn15, we need to be at row3 at turn14, and then U to row4 at turn15.\n\nBut at turn14, we are at row1. How to be at row3 at turn14? \n\nWe would have to move from row1 to row3 in one turn? -> impossible.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the above 14-action path is the best.\n\nBut let's double-check the safety at each step:\n\n turn12: action U -> at turn13: y=1 (freeway1) -> turn13 not in bad set for freeway1 -> safe.\n turn13: action S -> at turn14: y=1 (freeway1) -> turn14 not in bad set for freeway1 -> safe.\n turn14: action D -> at turn15: y=0 -> safe (not a freeway).\n turn15: action S -> at turn16: y=0 -> safe.\n turn16: action S -> at turn17: y=0 -> safe.\n turn17: action U -> at turn18: y=1 (freeway1) -> turn18: freeway1 bad set: {15,16,17,24,25,26} -> 18 not in -> safe.\n turn18: U -> at19: y=2 (freeway2) -> turn19: not in bad set for freeway2 (bad at 15-17,24-26) -> safe.\n turn19: U -> at20: y=3 (freeway3) -> turn20: freeway3 bad set: {16,17} -> 20 not in -> safe.\n turn20: U -> at21: y=4 (freeway4) -> turn21: freeway4 bad set: {16,17} -> 21 not in -> safe.\n turn21: U -> at22: y=5 (freeway5) -> turn22: freeway5 bad set: {14} -> 22 not in -> safe.\n turn22: U -> at23: y=6 (freeway6) -> no bad set -> safe.\n turn23: U -> at24: y=7 (freeway7) -> turn24: freeway7 bad set: {14} -> safe.\n turn24: U -> at25: y=8 (freeway8) -> turn25: freeway8 bad set: {14} -> safe.\n turn25: U -> at26: y=9 -> goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd we reach at turn26.\n\nSo the sequence of actions for turns 12 to 25:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut wait, after turn25, at turn26 we are at 9, so we stop. The last action is at turn25.\n\nTotal actions: 14.\n\nIs there a way with 13 actions?\n\nSuppose we start at turn12 at row0.\n\nAfter 13 actions, we would be at turn25. We need to be at row9.\n\nThe net upward movement must be +9.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo the number of U minus number of D = 9.\n\nLet u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S.\n\nThen: u + d + s = 13 (total actions)\n      u - d = 9\n\nAdding: 2u + s = 22 -> u = (22 - s)/2\n\ns must be even and 0<=s<=13, and u = (22-s)/2 >= 9.\n\nAlso, u = (22-s)/2 must be integer.\n\ns can be 0,2,4,..., up to 22.\n\nMinimal u is 9 (when s=4, d=0) but then u= (22-4)/2 = 9, and d = u - 9 = 0, and s=4.\n\nSo one possibility: 9 U, 0 D, 4 S.\n\nNow, can we find a path with 9 U, 0 D, 4 S in 13 turns that avoids collisions?\n\nWe start at row0 at turn12.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at turn25.\n\nThe moves: U 9 times and S 4 times.\n\nThe positions at each turn (after the action) will be the cumulative U minus cumulative D, but since D=0, it's just the number of U so far.\n\nBut we have to interleave the S's.\n\nLet me denote the number of U after k actions as u_k, then the row at turn (12+k) is u_k.\n\nBut note: at the action at turn t, it affects the position at turn t+1.\n\nWe are at turn12: before any action, row0.\n\nAfter action at turn12: we go to row1 at turn13 if U, or stay at0 if S.\n\nWe need at turn25 (after 13 actions) to be at row9.\n\nSo after 13 actions, the row is the number of U's in the 13 actions.\n\nWe need exactly 9 U's and 4 S's.\n\nSo the row at the end of each action:\n\nLet the actions be a12, a13, ..., a24.\n\nThen at turn13: y = 1 if a12=U, 0 if a12=S or D (but we have no D) \n          = 1 if a12=U, 0 if a12=S.\n\nAt turn14: y = y13 + 1 if a13=U, or y13 if a13=S.\n\n...\n\nAt turn25: y24 = number of U's in a12 to a24.\n\nWe need y24=9.\n\nNow, the safety condition: at each turn t from 13 to 25, if the row y_t is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y_t must not be bad at turn t.\n\nWe know the bad (freeway, turn) sets.\n\nWe need to assign the 9 U's and 4 S's in the 13 actions such that the path avoids bad states.\n\nThe row at turn13: must be either 0 or 1.\n\nTo minimize the time, we want to go up as fast as possible, so we would put as many U's as possible early.\n\nBut we have to avoid the bad turns.\n\nThe bad turns for freeway1 and2 are at 15,16,17,24,25,26 -> turns 15 to 17 and 24 to 26.\n\nFreeway3 and4: 16,17.\n\nFreeway5,7,8: only 14.\n\nFreeway6: none.\n\nWe are only concerned from turn13 to turn25.\n\nWe need to be at row0, or at a safe freeway, at each turn from 13 to 25.\n\nLet's try to go up as fast as possible:\n\nActions: \n  a12: U -> turn13: row1 (freeway1) -> turn13: safe.\n  a13: U -> turn14: row2 (freeway2) -> turn14: safe.\n  a14: U -> turn15: row3 (freeway3) -> turn15: safe (freeway3 bad at16,17, not15)\n  a15: U -> turn16: row4 (freeway4) -> turn16: bad! (freeway4 bad at16)\n\nSo we cannot do U at a15.\n\nWe can do S at a15: then at turn16: still at row3 (freeway3) -> turn16: bad for freeway3.\n\nOr D? But we are not allowed D because we want 0 D's.\n\nSo we must not be at a freeway that is bad at that turn.\n\nAt turn16, freeway3 and4 are bad, and also freeway1 and2 are bad.\n\nThe only safe freeways at turn16 are 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut to be at row5 at turn16, we would need to have done 5 U's by turn16 (which is after 5 actions: turns12 to16).\n\nBut we have done 4 actions (a12 to a15) and done 4 U's -> at turn16, we would be at row4, not 5.\n\nSo we cannot be at row5 at turn16.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row0 at turn16? \n\nBut we are at row3 at turn15. To be at row0 at turn16, we would need to do three D's in one turn? -> impossible.\n\nOr, we could have not gone up so fast.\n\nSuppose at a14 (turn14 action): instead of U, we do S.\n\nThen:\n  a12: U -> turn13: row1\n  a13: U -> turn14: row2\n  a14: S -> turn15: row2\n  at turn15: freeway2 -> bad (because 15 in bad set for freeway2) -> collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr at a14: D -> then turn15: row1 -> freeway1 at turn15: bad.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the collision at turn15 or turn16 if we go up to row3 at turn15.\n\nTherefore, we must be below row3 at turn15.\n\nAt turn15, safe freeways are row0, row3, row4, row5, etc. (row1 and2 are bad).\n\nSo we can be at row0,3,4,5,... at turn15.\n\nHow to be at row3 at turn15? \n  a12: U -> row1 at13\n  a13: U -> row2 at14\n  a14: U -> row3 at15 -> safe.\n\nBut then at turn16: we are at row3 (if we do S) or row4 (U) or row2 (D) -> all bad.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nHow to be at row4 at turn15? \n  a12: U->1 at13\n  a13: U->2 at14\n  a14: U->3 at15? and then we need to be at row4 at15 -> but we are at row3 at15. To be at row4 at15, we would have to have done an extra U earlier? But we have only three actions -> row3.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe state at turn15 is row0 or row5+.\n\nBut we cannot be at row5+ at turn15 with only three actions.\n\nSo the only safe state at turn15 is row0.\n\nTo be at row0 at turn15, we must have done one D and two U's? \n  a12: U ->1 at13\n  a13: U ->2 at14\n  a14: D ->1 at15 -> not 0.\n\nOr \n  a12: U->1 at13\n  a13: D->0 at14\n  a14: S->0 at15 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn15: row0.\n\nThen we need to get to row9 in the remaining 10 actions (from a15 to a24) with exactly 7 U's and 3 S's? \n  because total U's: 9, already used 1 -> need 8 more? \n  and total actions: 13, already used 3 -> 10 left.\n\nBut we need 9 U's in total, so we've used 1 U, need 8 more U's in 10 actions, so 8 U's and 2 S's.\n\nThen the net from turn15 (row0) to turn25 (row9) is 9 rows, but we are at row0 at turn15, and then we do 8 U's and 2 S's: net +8, so we end at row8, not 9.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf we do two U's initially:\n  a12: U->1 at13\n  a13: U->2 at14\n  a14: D->1 at15 -> then at turn15: row1 -> but row1 at15 is bad.\n\nNot safe.\n\nOr:\n  a12: U->1 at13\n  a13: D->0 at14\n  a14: D->-1 -> invalid.\n\nSo we cannot be at row0 at turn15 with two U's and one D.\n\nThe only way to be at row0 at turn15 is to have done one U and one D and one S, for example.\n\nBut then we only have one net U, and we need 9, so we have to do 8 more U's in the next 10 actions, so we end at row0+1+8=9.\n\nThat is possible.\n\nExample:\n\n a12: U -> turn13:1\n a13: D -> turn14:0\n a14: S -> turn15:0  [safe]\n\nThen from a15 to a24: 10 actions: 8 U's and 2 S's.\n\nThen the row at turn25 will be 0 + 8 = 8? We need 9.\n\nWe need 9 U's in total, so far we have 1 U, so we need 8 more U's. And we have 10 actions: so 8 U's and 2 S's, net +8, so from 0 to 8.\n\nThen we are at row8 at turn25, not 9.\n\nWe need one more U.\n\nBut we have no more actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do 9 U's in the 13 actions, but then the net from the first three actions is +0 (1U,1D,1S) and then 8 U's and 2 S's in the next 10? but 1U,1D,1S and then 8U,2S -> total U=9, D=1, S=3 -> net +8, to row8.\n\nStill not 9.\n\nTo get to row9 with 9 U's and 4 S's and 0 D's, we cannot afford to go down.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have a path with only 13 actions.\n\nThus, the minimal is 14 actions.\n\nSo the answer is the 14-action path we found.\n\nNow, write the actions:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut note: at turn14: D from row1 to row0 -> that is valid.\n\nAnd the last action at turn25: U from row8 to row9 at turn26.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n}\n\nNote: The actions are for turns 12 to 25 (inclusive), and after the last action (at turn25), at turn26 the player is at (0,9).\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), a sequence of actions is determined that minimizes the number of turns \\(H\\).

So we only check the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn (i.e., the starting freeway for that turn) for collisions.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1 (which is 20) until the turn when the player reaches y=9.\n\nWe note the car movements:\n\nFor a car on a freeway at turn t1 with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n- If left-moving (but note: the problem says left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] -> span(T)= [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving: span(t1)=[tau, h] -> span(T)= [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, note the given cars: all cars in the current state are right-moving. So we'll use the right-moving formula.\n\nBut wait: the representation of the car in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (so the larger x-coordinate) and tail is the back (smaller x-coordinate). So at turn t1, the car's span is [tau, h] (since they are moving right, so tail is at the left and head at the right). So at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1=20. We need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe are starting at y0 = 0 (at turn t1=20). We want to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have obstacles on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T contains 0.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions.\n\nSince the grid is small (only 10 rows) and the moves are sequential, we can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9. The state will be (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=20) and y is the current row (0..9). We start at (20,0) and we want to reach any state (t,9).\n\nBut note: the turn counter: we are at turn 20. We can let the turn index start at 20 and then 21, 22, etc.\n\nHowever, the car positions change with time. We must compute for each freeway and each car, the span at a given turn T (relative to t1=20: so T = 20, 21, 22, ...).\n\nWe are going to precompute the car spans for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting at 20 and until we reach the goal) the set of positions (actually the condition: whether there is a car on freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway we are on at a given turn. So if at turn T we are on freeway y, then we check if at turn T on freeway y there is a car such that 0 is in [tau + s*(T-20), h + s*(T-20)] for a right-moving car.\n\nLet me denote:\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) on freeway k (which is right-moving as per data) at turn T (T>=20):\n   left_end = tau + s*(T-20)\n   right_end = h + s*(T-20)\n\nWe must check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (since for right-moving, the car spans from left_end to right_end).\n\nWe note that the car spans might wrap around? But the problem doesn't say anything about wrapping, so we assume the cars are in an infinite line. However, the collision only occurs when the car covers 0 at the exact turn.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (for T from 20 up to a sufficiently large number, say until we have a solution) whether the freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., no car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: each freeway has multiple cars. We have to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nSo for freeway k at turn T, we check every car on that freeway. If any car has left_end <= 0 <= right_end, then the freeway k is unsafe at turn T.\n\nWe are going to create a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k in [1,8] and T in [20, ...] (we'll simulate until we find a solution).\n\nBut we don't know how many turns we need. We can precompute for T from 20 to 20 + MAX_TURNS (say 100, which should be enough because without obstacles we only need 9 moves).\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> note: head is -48, tail is -59? But for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? So actually, the head is the larger number? But -48 > -59, so yes. So at T=20: span = [-59, -48] (because tail is -59, head is -48). But wait, the representation says (head, tail) and then direction right. So in the update: \n      at T: [tau + s*(T-20), h + s*(T-20)] = [-59 + 4*(T-20), -48 + 4*(T-20)]\n\n  Similarly, \n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> [-23+4*(T-20), -12+4*(T-20)]\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> [13+4*(T-20), 24+4*(T-20)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> same as above\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> same\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> same\n\nFreeway 3:\n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(T-20), 48+6*(T-20)]\n  car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-20), 12+6*(T-20)]\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*(T-20), -24+6*(T-20)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-20), 48+12*(T-20)]\n  car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-20), 12+12*(T-20)]\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*(T-20), -24+12*(T-20)]\n\nFreeway 6:\n  car1: (48,37,right,3) -> [37+3*(T-20), 48+3*(T-20)]\n\nFreeway 7:\n  car1: (-48,-71,right,24) -> [-71+24*(T-20), -48+24*(T-20)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nWe note: at turn T, for a freeway k, we must check if the player is on that freeway (i.e., y=k) and if at that turn T, any car on freeway k has a span that includes 0.\n\nSo we precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for T from 20 to 20+max_horizon (say 100) the safety.\n\nWe'll create a function: is_safe(y, t) that returns True if at turn t, the freeway y is safe (meaning if the player is on freeway y at turn t, then no collision) or if y is 0 or 9 (no cars on y=0 and y=9, so always safe). But note: the problem says cars are on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe by definition.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9). When we are at y=9, we are safe and we stop.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS:\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 20) and y in [0,9].\nWe start at (20,0). We want to reach (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\nFrom a state (t, y), we can choose an action: U, D, S.\n\nBut note the constraints on y: after action, we must have y_next in [0,9]. So:\n  If y==0, we cannot go D (would be -1 -> invalid) so D is not allowed at y=0.\n  Similarly, at y=9, we cannot go U (would be 10 -> invalid). But we stop at y=9.\n\nSo for a state (t,y) we can try:\n  U: if y<9 -> new state (t+1, y+1)\n  D: if y>0 -> new state (t+1, y-1)\n  S: if y in [0,9] -> new state (t+1, y)\n\nBut we must check that the move is safe. How?\n\nImportant: when we are at state (t,y) we are about to take an action at turn t. But note the collision condition: at the beginning of turn t, we are on freeway y_prev (which is the y from the previous turn). However, the move we take at turn t will change the y for the next turn. But the collision check for the current turn t is based on the freeway we started the turn on.\n\nWait: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\nSo at turn T, we are on the freeway that we were at the beginning of the turn. That is, the freeway we were at the end of turn T-1 (or at the start state for turn t1).\n\nTherefore, when we are in state (t, y) at the beginning of turn t, we are on freeway y. Then we choose an action. But before we move, we must check if at turn t, freeway y is safe? Actually, the collision check for the current turn t is based on the starting freeway y. So we must check that the freeway y at turn t is safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if ...\", meaning that if at turn T we are on a freeway that has a car covering 0, then we crash.\n\nSo in our state (t,y): we are at the beginning of turn t, and we are on freeway y. We must check that freeway y at turn t is safe. If not, this state is invalid.\n\nThen, after we choose an action, we move to the next state (t+1, y') and then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are on freeway y' and we check safety for turn t+1 at freeway y'.\n\nTherefore, the BFS:\n\nWe start at (20,0). We must check: at turn 20, we are on freeway 0 -> safe (because no cars on freeway 0). So we are safe.\n\nThen we can take actions from (20,0): \n  U -> (21,1)\n  S -> (21,0)\n  D is not allowed.\n\nBut when we are at (21,1): at the beginning of turn 21, we are on freeway 1. We must check freeway 1 at turn 21: is it safe?\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nWe maintain a queue: (t, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions from t1 to the current turn.\n\nWe start with (20,0, []).\n\nWe mark visited states: (t, y) to avoid cycles. But note: we can revisit the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary? For example, we might wait (S) for a few turns to let a car pass. So we don't mark (t,y) as visited because we might come to the same y at a different turn and that is different. However, if we come to the same (t,y) again, we can skip. But note: the state is (t,y) and we are going forward in time, so we can have multiple paths to the same (t,y). But we want minimal turns? So we are doing BFS by time (each step is one turn). So the first time we reach a state (t,y) we have the minimal time for that (t,y) but we are looking for the minimal total turns to reach (t,9). Since we are doing BFS by time (each edge is one turn), we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we might have a shorter path that reaches y=9 earlier. So we do BFS by increasing t.\n\nWe'll expand states in increasing order of t.\n\nWe'll use a queue and we'll check states with t from 20 upward.\n\nWe must compute for each state (t,y) we consider: \n  if y is in {1,2,...,8}, then we check the freeway y at turn t: if it is safe? \n  if y is 0 or 9, then safe.\n\nIf not safe, then we skip this state.\n\nIf safe, then if y==9, we output the path and H = (current t - t1) + 1? Wait: we are at the beginning of turn t, and we have taken actions from turn 20 to turn t-1. The number of actions is (t - 20). But the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t (after having taken actions at turns 20,21,...,t-1). So if at the beginning of turn t we are at y=9, then we have already reached the goal? Actually, the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the last turn. But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and the state we are in at the beginning of a turn is the position at that turn.\n\nBut note: the update: after action at turn T, we get y_{T+1}. So:\n\nAt the beginning of turn 20: we are at (0,0). \nAfter action at turn 20: we get y_{21} = y_{20} + delta.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn 21 is (0, y_{21}).\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t,y), it means that at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. We have taken (t - 20) actions (turns 20 to t-1). \n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of some turn t. Then we stop.\n\nSo when we generate a state (t, y=9), we are done.\n\nWe then output the actions that led to that state: which are the actions for turns 20,21,...,t-1.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions = t - 20.\n\nBut we output the actions from turn 20 to turn t-1.\n\nWe'll set a maximum horizon, say until t=20+50 (to be safe).\n\nNow, we must precompute the safety for freeways 1..8 for turns from 20 to 20+max_horizon.\n\nLet max_horizon = 50, so T from 20 to 70.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each T in [20,70] whether freeway k is safe at turn T.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k in [1,8] and T in [20,70]. We initialize as True.\n\nThen for each freeway, for each car on that freeway, we compute the car's span at turn T and check if 0 is in [left, right]. If for any car on freeway k at turn T, 0 is in the span, then safe[k][T] = False.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nFreeway 1 (and 2, same cars) at turn T:\n  Car1: left = -59 + 4*(T-20), right = -48 + 4*(T-20)\n        Condition: -59+4*(T-20) <= 0 <= -48+4*(T-20) \n        => 4*(T-20) >= 59? Actually, let me solve:\n        left <= 0 <= right  -> \n          -59 + 4*(T-20) <= 0  => 4*(T-20) <= 59 -> T-20 <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> T <= 34.75 -> T<=34 for the left condition to hold? \n        and 0 <= -48+4*(T-20) -> 4*(T-20) >= 48 -> T-20>=12 -> T>=32.\n\n        So for T in [32,34] (because T is integer) the car1 covers 0? Let's check:\n          T=32: left = -59+4*12 = -59+48 = -11, right = -48+48=0 -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> yes, 0 is the right_end.\n        T=33: left = -59+52=-7, right = -48+52=4 -> [ -7,4] -> 0 is included.\n        T=34: left = -59+56=-3, right = -48+56=8 -> includes 0.\n        T=35: left = -59+60=1, right = -48+60=12 -> 0 not included.\n\n        So car1 is unsafe for T in [32,34].\n\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,4) -> \n        left = -23+4*(T-20), right = -12+4*(T-20)\n        Condition: -23+4*(T-20) <= 0 <= -12+4*(T-20)\n        => 4*(T-20) <= 23 -> T-20 <= 5.75 -> T<=25.75 -> T<=25\n        and 0<=-12+4*(T-20) -> 4*(T-20)>=12 -> T-20>=3 -> T>=23.\n\n        So T in [23,25]:\n          T=23: left=-23+12=-11, right=-12+12=0 -> unsafe.\n          T=24: left=-23+16=-7, right=-12+16=4 -> unsafe.\n          T=25: left=-23+20=-3, right=-12+20=8 -> unsafe.\n\n  Car3: (24,13,right,4) -> \n        left=13+4*(T-20), right=24+4*(T-20)\n        Condition: 13+4*(T-20)<=0<=24+4*(T-20) -> \n          The left part: 13+4*(T-20)<=0 -> 4*(T-20)<=-13 -> which is impossible because T>=20 -> T-20>=0 -> 4*(T-20)>=0, so 13+...>=13>0. \n        So car3 never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 (and 2) is unsafe at T in [23,25] (from car2) and [32,34] (from car1).\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (and 4) at turn T:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,6) -> \n        left = 37+6*(T-20), right=48+6*(T-20)\n        Condition: 37+6*(T-20)<=0<=48+6*(T-20) -> \n          The left part: 37+6*(T-20)<=0 -> 6*(T-20)<=-37 -> impossible. So safe.\n\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> \n        left=1+6*(T-20), right=12+6*(T-20)\n        Condition: 1+6*(T-20)<=0<=12+6*(T-20) -> \n          left<=0: 1+6*(T-20)<=0 -> 6*(T-20)<=-1 -> impossible. Safe.\n\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> \n        left=-35+6*(T-20), right=-24+6*(T-20)\n        Condition: -35+6*(T-20)<=0<=-24+6*(T-20)\n        => 6*(T-20)>=24? -> T-20>=4 -> T>=24\n        and 6*(T-20)<=35 -> T-20<=35/6≈5.83 -> T<=25.83 -> T<=25.\n\n        So T in [24,25]:\n          T=24: left=-35+24=-11, right=-24+24=0 -> unsafe (0 included)\n          T=25: left=-35+30=-5, right=-24+30=6 -> unsafe.\n\nSo freeway 3 (and 4) unsafe at T=24,25.\n\nFreeway 5 at turn T:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> \n        left=37+12*(T-20), right=48+12*(T-20) -> always positive for T>=20 -> safe.\n\n  Car2: (12,1,right,12) -> \n        left=1+12*(T-20), right=12+12*(T-20) -> always positive -> safe.\n\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> \n        left=-35+12*(T-20), right=-24+12*(T-20)\n        Condition: -35+12*(T-20)<=0<=-24+12*(T-20)\n        => 12*(T-20)>=24 -> T-20>=2 -> T>=22\n        and 12*(T-20)<=35 -> T-20<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=22.916 -> T=22 only.\n\n        T=22: left=-35+24=-11, right=-24+24=0 -> unsafe.\n\n        So freeway 5 unsafe at T=22.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn T:\n  Car1: (48,37,right,3) -> \n        left=37+3*(T-20), right=48+3*(T-20) -> always positive -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 6 is always safe? \n\nBut wait: we have only one car? and it's always positive? So yes, freeway 6 is safe for all T>=20.\n\nFreeway 7 (and 8) at turn T:\n  Car1: (-48,-71,right,24) -> \n        left=-71+24*(T-20), right=-48+24*(T-20)\n        Condition: -71+24*(T-20)<=0<=-48+24*(T-20)\n        => 24*(T-20)>=48 -> T-20>=2 -> T>=22\n        and 24*(T-20)<=71 -> T-20<=71/24≈2.958 -> T<=22.958 -> T=22 only.\n\n        T=22: left=-71+48=-23, right=-48+48=0 -> unsafe.\n\n        So freeway 7 and 8 unsafe at T=22.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways:\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: T in [23,25] and [32,34]\nFreeway 3 and 4: T in [24,25]\nFreeway 5: T=22\nFreeway 7 and 8: T=22\nFreeway 6: always safe.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\nWe start at (20,0) -> safe (freeway0).\n\nWe consider actions from (20,0):\n  U: next state (21,1) -> at turn21, freeway1: safe? \n        freeway1: T=21 -> not in [23,25] or [32,34] -> safe.\n  S: next state (21,0) -> safe (freeway0)\n  D: not allowed.\n\nSo from (20,0) we can go to (21,1) and (21,0).\n\nNow, state (21,1): \n  Actions: U -> (22,2), D -> (22,0), S -> (22,1)\n\nBut we must check at the beginning of turn21: we are on freeway1 -> safe (as above).\n\nNow, for the next states at turn22:\n\n  For (22,2): at turn22, we are on freeway2 -> unsafe? \n        freeway2: T=22 -> safe? \n        But our unsafe periods for freeway2: [23,25] and [32,34] -> so safe at T=22.\n\n  For (22,0): safe (freeway0)\n  For (22,1): at turn22, freeway1 -> safe (since freeway1 unsafe starts at T=23)\n\nSo all three are safe.\n\nBut note: we also have state (21,0) from the S action at turn20. From (21,0):\n  Actions: U-> (22,1), S-> (22,0), D-> not allowed.\n\nSo we have two ways to get to (22,1): \n  one: (20,0)->U->(21,1)->S->(22,1)\n  two: (20,0)->S->(21,0)->U->(22,1)\n\nWe'll consider both.\n\nWe are going to do BFS by time. We'll consider all states at time 20, then 21, then 22, etc.\n\nWe'll use a queue. We start:\n\nLevel0 (t=20): \n   (20,0) -> path = []\n\nLevel1 (t=21):\n   (21,1) -> path = ['U']\n   (21,0) -> path = ['S']\n\nLevel2 (t=22):\n   From (21,1):\n        U -> (22,2) -> path = ['U','U']\n        D -> (22,0) -> path = ['U','D']\n        S -> (22,1) -> path = ['U','S']\n   From (21,0):\n        U -> (22,1) -> path = ['S','U']   -> but we already have (22,1) from above? We don't care, we'll consider both and then if we get to the same state with the same t, we don't need to store multiple paths? Actually, we are doing BFS and we want minimal time. So the first time we reach (t,y) we have the minimal time? But note: we might have multiple paths to the same (t,y) and they are equally good. We can store one path per (t,y). So we can mark visited (t,y) and skip if we have seen (t,y) already.\n\nBut we are going in increasing t. So when we generate (t,y), we haven't seen that (t,y) before because t is increasing. So we don't need to worry about duplicates at the same t? Actually, from different states at t-1 we can generate the same (t,y). We should avoid processing the same state twice? But we are doing BFS by time, so we are generating all states at time t together. We can store a visited set per time? Or we can simply store a set of visited states (t,y) and if we see (t,y) again, we skip.\n\nBut note: we might have a shorter path (in terms of number of moves) to (t,y) but we are going by time steps so we don't care about the path, we care about the time. And the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal time? Actually, we are expanding by time, so the first time we see a state (t,y) is the minimal time for that state. But we are generating states for increasing t. So we can break when we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll use a visited set: if we have seen (t,y) then we skip.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple paths to (t,y) and we want to consider all? Actually, we are doing BFS and we are generating at the same time t, we might get the same (t,y) from multiple paths. We can skip if we have already generated (t,y) at the same t? But we are generating at the same t: so we should mark (t,y) as visited at time t.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nLet visited be a set of (t,y).\n\nWe start with (20,0) and mark visited.\n\nThen for each state (t,y) we generate next states (t+1, y') and if (t+1, y') is not visited and the state (t+1,y') is safe (we check the freeway y' at turn t+1? Actually, wait: at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y'. So we check safety at turn t+1 for freeway y' (if y' is between 1 and 8). And we also check that the move from (t,y) to (t+1,y') is valid (y' in [0,9]).\n\nBut note: we already did the move? The state (t+1,y') is the result of the move. Then we check safety for that state: at turn t+1, we are at y', so we need freeway y' to be safe at turn t+1.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  for each state (t,y) in the queue for time t:\n      for each action in [U, D, S] that leads to a valid y_next (in [0,9]):\n          y_next = \n              if U: y+1\n              if D: y-1\n              if S: y\n          Then we have a candidate state (t+1, y_next)\n\n          Then we check: at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y_next -> so we check safety at turn t+1 for freeway y_next (if y_next in [1,8], then we use our precomputed safe; if 0 or 9, safe).\n\n          If safe and (t+1, y_next) not visited, then we add to the queue for next time step.\n\nWe break when we find (t+1, 9) and safe.\n\nNow, let's simulate:\n\nWe start:\n\nt=20: \n   state: (20,0) -> visited.add((20,0))\n\n   Actions: \n        U: (21,1) -> check safety at turn21 for freeway1: safe -> add to queue for t=21.\n        S: (21,0) -> safe -> add.\n        D: invalid.\n\n   Queue for t=21: [(21,1, path=['U']), (21,0, path=['S'])]\n\nt=21:\n   Process (21,1): \n        Actions:\n            U: (22,2) -> check freeway2 at turn22: safe? \n                  freeway2 at T=22: we have unsafe periods: [23,25] and [32,34] -> so safe. \n                  and not visited? -> we haven't seen (22,2) -> add with path ['U','U'].\n            D: (22,0) -> safe (freeway0) -> add with path ['U','D'].\n            S: (22,1) -> check freeway1 at turn22: safe? \n                  freeway1: T=22 -> safe (since unsafe starts at 23) -> add with ['U','S'].\n\n   Process (21,0):\n        Actions:\n            U: (22,1) -> check freeway1 at turn22: safe -> but we already generated (22,1) from (21,1) with action S? \n                  But we haven't visited (22,1) yet? We are processing t=21 and generating t=22. We are generating (22,1) twice? \n                  We can avoid by having visited set for the entire BFS. So when we generate (22,1) from (21,1), we mark visited (22,1). Then when we generate from (21,0) we see it's visited and skip.\n\n        So we must mark states as we generate them for the next time step.\n\n        We'll generate states for t=22 in order. We'll have a set for the current time step? Actually, we can generate all and then mark at the end? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a set for the entire BFS: we mark (t,y) as visited as soon as we generate it.\n\n        Let's do: \n\n          We have a queue that is per time step? But we are doing BFS by time so we process by increasing t.\n\n          We'll have a set visited that contains (t,y) for all states we have ever generated.\n\n          When we generate (t+1, y_next), we check if (t+1, y_next) is in visited? If not, we add to the queue and mark visited.\n\n        So:\n\n          Start: visited = {(20,0)}\n          t=20: generate (21,1) -> not visited -> add and mark visited (21,1); (21,0) -> add and mark visited (21,0)\n\n          t=21: \n              state (21,1): \n                 U: (22,2) -> not visited -> add and mark visited (22,2) -> path: ['U','U']\n                 D: (22,0) -> not visited -> add and mark (22,0) -> path: ['U','D']\n                 S: (22,1) -> not visited -> add and mark (22,1) -> path: ['U','S']\n\n              state (21,0):\n                 U: (22,1) -> already visited? (we just marked (22,1) from the previous) -> skip.\n                 S: (22,0) -> already visited? (we have (22,0)) -> skip.\n                 D: invalid.\n\n          So at t=22, we have states: (22,2), (22,0), (22,1)\n\nt=22:\n   Process (22,2): \n        Actions: \n            U: (23,3) -> check freeway3 at turn23: \n                  freeway3 unsafe at T=24,25 -> so T=23 is safe? -> safe.\n            D: (23,1) -> freeway1 at turn23: unsafe? freeway1 unsafe at T in [23,25] -> so T=23 is unsafe! -> skip.\n            S: (23,2) -> freeway2 at turn23: unsafe? freeway2 unsafe at T in [23,25] -> unsafe -> skip.\n\n        So only U is valid: (23,3) -> safe -> add and mark visited (23,3) -> path: ['U','U','U']\n\n   Process (22,0):\n        Actions:\n            U: (23,1) -> freeway1 at turn23: unsafe -> skip.\n            S: (23,0) -> safe -> add and mark (23,0) -> path: ['U','D','S']? \n                 Actually, the path: from (20,0): U to (21,1), then D to (22,0), then S to (23,0) -> path = ['U','D','S']\n            D: invalid.\n\n        So we add (23,0)\n\n   Process (22,1):\n        Actions:\n            U: (23,2) -> freeway2 at turn23: unsafe -> skip.\n            D: (23,0) -> already generated? we have (23,0) from above? -> skip.\n            S: (23,1) -> freeway1 at turn23: unsafe -> skip.\n\n        So no new states from (22,1).\n\n   So at t=23, we have: (23,3) and (23,0)\n\nt=23:\n   (23,3): \n        Actions:\n            U: (24,4) -> freeway4 at turn24: unsafe? freeway4 (same as freeway3) unsafe at T=24,25 -> unsafe -> skip.\n            D: (24,2) -> freeway2 at turn24: unsafe (freeway2 unsafe at T in [23,25]) -> skip.\n            S: (24,3) -> freeway3 at turn24: unsafe -> skip.\n\n        So no moves from (23,3) -> dead end.\n\n   (23,0):\n        Actions:\n            U: (24,1) -> freeway1 at turn24: unsafe -> skip.\n            S: (24,0) -> safe -> add (24,0) -> path: ['U','D','S','S'] -> but wait, we had two moves: \n                 Actually, the path: \n                    turn20: U -> turn21: D -> turn22: S -> turn23: S -> so path = ['U','D','S','S']\n            D: invalid.\n\n        So we have (24,0)\n\nt=24: \n   state: (24,0) -> \n        Actions:\n            U: (25,1) -> freeway1 at turn25: unsafe -> skip.\n            S: (25,0) -> safe -> add (25,0) -> path: ['U','D','S','S','S']\n            D: invalid.\n\nt=25:\n   state: (25,0) -> \n        Actions:\n            U: (26,1) -> freeway1 at turn26: safe? \n                  freeway1 unsafe at [23,25] and [32,34] -> so T=26 is safe -> add (26,1) -> path: ['U','D','S','S','S','U']\n            S: (26,0) -> safe -> add (26,0) -> path: ... with extra S.\n\nt=26:\n   state (26,1):\n        Actions:\n            U: (27,2) -> freeway2 at turn27: safe? T=27 -> safe -> add (27,2) -> path: ... then 'U'\n            D: (27,0) -> safe -> add (27,0)\n            S: (27,1) -> freeway1 at turn27: safe -> add (27,1)\n\n   state (26,0):\n        Actions: \n            U: (27,1) -> same as above -> skip if already generated? \n            S: (27,0) -> skip if generated?\n            D: invalid.\n\n        But we are generating (27,1) from (26,1) and (26,0) -> so we skip the duplicate.\n\n        So we have (27,2), (27,0), (27,1)\n\nWe continue until we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we might have a shorter path? We are at turn26 and we are only at y=1 or 0. We need to go up to 9.\n\nWe must avoid freeways at unsafe times.\n\nWe note that freeway1 and 2 become unsafe again at T=32,33,34. So we must avoid being on freeway1 or 2 at those turns.\n\nWe are at turn26. We have 6 turns to get to 9? But we can move up 8 more steps. But we might have to wait.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider a different path: at turn20, we did U, then D at turn21 to go back to 0. Then we waited until turn26 to go to 1. But maybe we can go faster.\n\nLet me try to go straight up without waiting:\n\nAt turn20: U -> (21,1) safe.\nAt turn21: U -> (22,2) safe.\nAt turn22: U -> (23,3) safe? at turn23 we are at freeway3: we computed freeway3 unsafe at T=24,25? But we are at turn23: freeway3 at T=23 is safe. Then we did U to (23,3) -> then at turn23 we are at 3, then at turn23 we try to go to 4? but then at turn24 we would be at freeway4 -> unsafe. So we cannot go through freeway4 at turn24.\n\nBut what if at turn23 we go to freeway4 at a safe time? We see freeway4 is unsafe at 24 and 25. So we must avoid freeway4 at turns24 and 25.\n\nBut we are at turn23 at freeway3. We can only move to freeway4 at turn24? We can wait at freeway3 for two turns? But freeway3 is unsafe at turn24 and 25. So we cannot wait at freeway3 at turn24: because at turn24 we would be at freeway3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo from (23,3) we must leave immediately? But we can only go to freeway2 or freeway4? freeway2 is unsafe at turn24, and freeway4 is unsafe at turn24. So we are stuck.\n\nSo that path is dead.\n\nWe need to wait at a safe row until the unsafe time passes.\n\nWe are currently at (23,0) at turn23. Then we wait until turn26 to go to 1. But then we can go up.\n\nWe are at turn26 at (26,1). Then we can go up:\n\nturn26: at (26,1) -> U -> turn27: (27,2) [freeway2 at turn27: safe? yes]\nturn27: U -> (28,3) [freeway3 at turn28: safe? yes, unsafe only at 24,25]\nturn28: U -> (29,4) [freeway4 at turn29: safe? yes]\nturn29: U -> (30,5) [freeway5: unsafe only at T=22 -> safe]\nturn30: U -> (31,6) [freeway6: always safe]\nturn31: U -> (32,7) [freeway7 at turn32: unsafe? freeway7 unsafe only at T=22 -> safe? \n        But wait: freeway7 unsafe at T=22 -> so at T=32, safe? yes]\nturn32: U -> (33,8) [freeway8 at turn33: safe? freeway8 unsafe only at T=22 -> safe]\nturn33: U -> (34,9) -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn34 we are at freeway9? Actually, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn34 -> goal.\n\nSo the path from (26,1) to (34,9) is 8 moves: U at every step.\n\nBut we started at (26,1) and we go to (27,2), (28,3), ... (34,9). So 8 moves.\n\nTotal turns: from turn20 to turn34? That's 14 turns? But the actions are from turn20 to turn33 (14 actions?).\n\nBut let's count:\n\nturn20: action0\n...\nturn33: action13 -> then at the beginning of turn34 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the number of actions is 14.\n\nBut we had a path to (26,1): \n   turn20: U\n   turn21: D\n   turn22: S\n   turn23: S\n   turn24: S\n   turn25: S\n   turn26: U   -> that's 7 actions to get to (26,1)\n\nThen from (26,1) we do 8 actions (U at turns26 to turn33) -> total 15 actions.\n\nBut wait: the actions:\n\nturn20: U -> then at turn21 we are at 1.\nturn21: D -> turn22 we are at 0.\nturn22: S -> turn23 we are at 0.\nturn23: S -> turn24 we are at 0.\nturn24: S -> turn25 we are at 0.\nturn25: S -> turn26 we are at 0? But then at turn26 we do U -> at turn27 we are at 1.\n\nBut we wanted to be at (26,1) at the beginning of turn26? \n\nActually, our state (26,1) is at the beginning of turn26. How did we get there? \n\nAt turn25: we were at (25,0) and we did U -> then at turn26 we are at (26,1). \n\nSo the path to (26,1) is:\n\n   turn20: U -> (21,1)\n   turn21: D -> (22,0)\n   turn22: S -> (23,0)\n   turn23: S -> (24,0)\n   turn24: S -> (25,0)\n   turn25: U -> (26,1)\n\nSo that's 6 actions.\n\nThen from (26,1) we do:\n\n   turn26: U -> (27,2)\n   turn27: U -> (28,3)\n   turn28: U -> (29,4)\n   turn29: U -> (30,5)\n   turn30: U -> (31,6)\n   turn31: U -> (32,7)\n   turn32: U -> (33,8)\n   turn33: U -> (34,9) -> goal.\n\nSo 8 more actions, total 14 actions.\n\nBut we must check safety for freeway7 at turn32? We are at freeway7 at turn32: \n   freeway7: unsafe at T=22 -> safe at T=32.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn33: safe.\n\nBut wait: we are at freeway8 at turn33: \n   freeway8: unsafe only at T=22 -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut we must also check the intermediate steps:\n\nAt turn32: we are at freeway7? Actually, at turn32: \n   we start at (32,7) -> then we do U to go to 8 at turn33. \n   But at the beginning of turn32, we are at y=7 -> freeway7. We check: freeway7 at T=32 -> safe.\n\nAt turn33: we start at y=8 -> freeway8 at T=33 -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is 14 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe might avoid the initial backtracking. \n\nFor example, at turn20: \n   U to 1 at turn21 -> safe.\n   Then at turn21: instead of going down, we stay? \n        S: (22,1) -> safe? freeway1 at turn22: safe (since unsafe starts at 23) -> safe.\n   Then at turn22: we must avoid freeway1 at turn23? \n        We can go up: U -> (23,2) -> freeway2 at turn23: unsafe -> not allowed.\n        Down: D -> (23,0) -> safe.\n        Or S: (23,1) -> unsafe.\n\n   So at turn22: from (22,1) we can only go down to (23,0).\n\n   Then we are at (23,0) at turn23 -> same as before.\n\n   Then we wait until turn26 to go up.\n\n   The path: \n        turn20: U\n        turn21: S\n        turn22: D\n        turn23: S\n        turn24: S\n        turn25: U -> then at turn26 we are at (26,1) -> then same as above.\n\n   That's 6 actions to (26,1) as well.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to freeway6 as soon as possible? freeway6 is always safe.\n\nBut we are at 0, and we need to go to 9. We can go up to 6 and then wait? But we don't need to wait because freeway6 is always safe.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times for the freeways in between.\n\nWe can try:\n\nturn20: U -> (21,1) [safe]\nturn21: U -> (22,2) [safe]\nturn22: U -> (23,3) [safe] \nBut then at turn23, we are at 3. Now we cannot go to 4 at turn24 because freeway4 is unsafe at 24,25. \nBut we can go down? \n   turn23: D -> (24,2) -> freeway2 at turn24: unsafe -> not allowed.\n   turn23: S -> (24,3) -> freeway3 at turn24: unsafe -> not allowed.\n   turn23: U -> (24,4) -> freeway4 at turn24: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nWe could have waited at freeway2 or freeway1? But freeway1 and 2 become unsafe at turn23. So we cannot wait at freeway1 or 2 at turn23.\n\nSo the only safe place to wait is at y=0 or y=6 or above? \n\nBut note: we can also wait at freeway5? freeway5 is unsafe only at T=22. So at other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and 4: unsafe only at 24,25 -> safe at turn26 and beyond.\n\nBut we are at freeway3 at turn23. We cannot wait at freeway3 at turn24 because it's unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway3 at turn23? But we have no safe move.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway3 at turn23? \n\nWe must be at freeway0 at turn23? \n\nSo the only safe path is to be at freeway0 during the unsafe periods for the low freeways.\n\nWe had a path that gets to (26,1) in 6 moves, then 8 moves to 9 -> 14 moves.\n\nBut can we get to 9 faster?\n\nWe could go to freeway6 and then go up quickly.\n\nHow?\n\nWe need to get to freeway6 as soon as possible. But we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe can try:\n\nturn20: S (wait at 0) -> turn21:0 -> safe.\nturn21: U -> turn22:1 -> freeway1 at turn22: safe.\nturn22: U -> turn23:2 -> freeway2 at turn23: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn22.\n\nAlternatively, at turn20: U (to1 at21) -> then at turn21: U (to2 at22) -> then at turn22: we have to avoid freeway2 at turn23? \n   We can only go down: to1 at23? but freeway1 at23: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at turn22? \n\nThen:\n\nturn20: U (to1 at21)\nturn21: D (to0 at22)\nturn22: S (0) -> safe\nturn23: S (0) -> safe\nturn24: S (0) -> safe\nturn25: U (to1 at26) -> then same as before.\n\nSo again 6 moves to get to 1 at turn26.\n\nBut what if we try to go up faster after turn26? \n\nWe are at (26,1) at the beginning of turn26. We want to go to 9. The minimal moves is 8 moves (U 8 times). And we have to do them in 8 consecutive turns? \n\nBut we can do them without waiting because:\n\nfreeway1: unsafe at [23,25] and [32,34] -> so at turn26: safe, turn27: safe, ... until turn32: then freeway1 is unsafe? but we are at freeway1 only at turn26? \nActually, we go:\n\n   turn26: at1 -> then U to2 at turn27 -> freeway2 at27: safe (since unsafe only at [23,25] and [32,34] -> 27 is safe)\n   turn27: at2 -> U to3 at28 -> freeway3: safe at28\n   turn28: at3 -> U to4 at29 -> freeway4: safe at29\n   turn29: at4 -> U to5 at30 -> freeway5: safe at30\n   turn30: at5 -> U to6 at31 -> freeway6: safe at31\n   turn31: at6 -> U to7 at32 -> freeway7: safe at32 (only unsafe at22)\n   turn32: at7 -> U to8 at33 -> freeway8: safe at33 (only unsafe at22)\n   turn33: at8 -> U to9 at34 -> goal.\n\nSo 8 moves, and we are safe.\n\nTotal turns: 14.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier? \n\nWe are at 0 at turn25. Instead of going to1 at turn26, we could go to1 at turn25? \n   But at turn25: we are at0 -> then U to1 at turn26? \n   Actually, at turn25: we are at0 -> we do U -> then at turn26 we are at1.\n\n   But if we try to go to1 at an earlier turn? \n\n   At turn24: we are at0 -> then U to1 at turn25: \n        then at turn25 we are at1 -> freeway1 at25: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n   So we must wait until turn26 to go to1.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time is 14 turns.\n\nBut we have a path: \n   turn20: U\n   turn21: D\n   turn22: S\n   turn23: S\n   turn24: S\n   turn25: S\n   turn26: U\n   turn27: U\n   turn28: U\n   turn29: U\n   turn30: U\n   turn31: U\n   turn32: U\n   turn33: U\n\nBut wait, the path above for the first part was:\n\n   turn20: U -> (21,1)\n   turn21: D -> (22,0)\n   turn22: S -> (23,0)\n   turn23: S -> (24,0)\n   turn24: S -> (25,0)\n   turn25: U -> (26,1)\n\nBut the actions:\n\n   Turn20: U\n   Turn21: D\n   Turn22: S\n   Turn23: S\n   Turn24: S\n   Turn25: U   -> then we are at (26,1) at the beginning of turn26.\n\n   Then:\n      Turn26: U -> (27,2)\n      Turn27: U -> (28,3)\n      Turn28: U -> (29,4)\n      Turn29: U -> (30,5)\n      Turn30: U -> (31,6)\n      Turn31: U -> (32,7)\n      Turn32: U -> (33,8)\n      Turn33: U -> (34,9)\n\nSo the last action is at turn33, and then at the beginning of turn34 we are at9.\n\nSo the actions are from turn20 to turn33 (14 actions).\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions starting at turn t1=20 to the last action.\n\nSo the answer should be 14 lines.\n\nBut note: we have 14 actions: \n   turn20: U\n   turn21: D\n   turn22: S\n   turn23: S\n   turn24: S\n   turn25: U\n   turn26: U\n   turn27: U\n   turn28: U\n   turn29: U\n   turn30: U\n   turn31: U\n   turn32: U\n   turn33: U\n\nBut wait: at turn25 we did U and then at turn26 we are at1. Then at turn26 we do U to go to2.\n\nBut we must check safety at the intermediate steps? \n\nWe already did: \n   turn20: at0 -> safe.\n   turn21: at1 -> safe? T=21: freeway1 safe -> yes.\n   turn22: at0 -> safe.\n   turn23: at0 -> safe.\n   turn24: at0 -> safe.\n   turn25: at0 -> safe.\n   turn26: at1 -> T=26: freeway1 safe -> yes.\n   turn27: at2 -> T=27: freeway2 safe -> yes.\n   turn28: at3 -> T=28: freeway3 safe -> yes.\n   turn29: at4 -> T=29: freeway4 safe -> yes.\n   turn30: at5 -> T=30: freeway5 safe -> yes.\n   turn31: at6 -> T=31: freeway6 safe -> yes.\n   turn32: at7 -> T=32: freeway7 safe -> yes.\n   turn33: at8 -> T=33: freeway8 safe -> yes.\n\nAnd then after the last action (turn33: U) we go to9 at turn34.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so H=14.\n\nBut we have 14 actions: for turns 20 to 33.\n\nWe can also have a shorter path? \n\nWhat if we go to freeway6 earlier? \n\nBut we are blocked at the lower freeways during turns 22 to 25. \n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to freeway5 at a safe time? freeway5 is only unsafe at T=22. \n\nBut to get to freeway5, we have to go through freeway1 to 4. And they are unsafe at various times.\n\nWe try:\n\n   turn20: S (wait at0) -> turn21:0\n   turn21: S -> turn22:0 -> at turn22 we are at0 -> safe.\n   turn22: U -> turn23:1 -> unsafe! (freeway1 at23: unsafe)\n\n   So we cannot.\n\nWe must be at0 during turn23? \n\n   turn20: U (to1 at21)\n   turn21: D (to0 at22)\n   turn22: S (to0 at23) -> safe\n   turn23: S (to0 at24) -> safe\n   turn24: U -> turn25:1 -> unsafe at25? freeway1 at25: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n   So we must wait until turn26 to go to1.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until turn26 to leave y=0.\n\nSo the minimal H is 14.\n\nBut note: we have another path that also reaches (26,1) in 6 moves: \n\n   turn20: U\n   turn21: S\n   turn22: D\n   turn23: S\n   turn24: S\n   turn25: U\n\nBut that is also 6 moves. Then same 8 moves to 9 -> 14 moves.\n\nSo we can choose any.\n\nWe'll output one.\n\nWe choose the first one we found.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=14.\n\nIs there a path with H<14?\n\nSuppose we try to be at y=6 at turn26? \n\nWe start at0. We need to get to6 in 6 moves? \n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   turn20: U (1 at21)\n   turn21: U (2 at22)\n   turn22: we cannot go to3 at23? because then at23 we are at3 -> then at24 we cannot be at3 or4? \n\n   Instead, at turn22: we go down to1? but then at23: unsafe.\n\n   Or wait at2 at22: then at turn22 we are at2 -> safe. Then at turn23: we must leave because freeway2 at23 is unsafe -> but we can only go to1 (unsafe) or to3? \n        U: to3 at23 -> safe? freeway3 at23: safe -> yes.\n        Then at turn23: we are at3. Then at turn24: we must avoid freeway3 (unsafe) and freeway4 (unsafe). \n        So we can go down to2? but freeway2 at24: unsafe -> not allowed.\n        Or up to4: unsafe.\n        Or stay: unsafe.\n\n   So stuck.\n\nAlternatively, we try to skip freeway1 and 2 quickly? \n\n   turn20: U (1 at21)\n   turn21: U (2 at22)\n   turn22: U (3 at23) -> safe? freeway3 at23: safe -> yes.\n   turn23: then we are stuck? as above.\n\n   So we cannot progress.\n\nTherefore, we believe the minimal is 14.\n\nSo we output the sequence:\n\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n\nBut wait: at turn25 we are at0, then we do U to go to1 at turn26. Then we do U at turn26 to go to2 at turn27. \n\nBut we must check: at turn26 we are at1 -> safe. Then we do U -> then at turn27 we are at2 -> safe.\n\nBut what about the freeway6? It's always safe, so we don't have to worry.\n\nWe'll code the BFS to be sure, but since we are writing by hand, we trust our reasoning.\n\nBut let me check a different path: \n\n   turn20: S (wait) -> (21,0)\n   turn21: S -> (22,0)\n   turn22: S -> (23,0)\n   turn23: S -> (24,0)\n   turn24: S -> (25,0)\n   turn25: U -> (26,1) -> then same as above.\n\nThat also takes 6 moves to get to (26,1). Then 8 moves to9 -> 14 moves.\n\nBut we started with a wait. \n\nThe problem doesn't require the minimal path to be unique.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut the initial move: we did U at turn20. We could do S at turn20.\n\nWe'll output the one we have.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So H=14.\n\nIn the answer format, we output the actions for turns 20 to 33.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n\nBut wait: we have 14 lines, but the last action is at turn33.\n\nWe must make sure that after the last action (at turn33) we are at9 at the next turn (turn34). And we are.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}\n\nBut we can also have a path that doesn't go down at turn21? \n\nFor example:\n\n   turn20: U -> (21,1)\n   turn21: S -> (22,1)  [safe because freeway1 at22: safe]\n   turn22: D -> (23,0)  [because freeway1 at23: unsafe, so we go down to0 -> safe]\n   then we wait at0: \n        turn23: S -> (24,0)\n        turn24: S -> (25,0)\n        turn25: U -> (26,1)  -> same as before.\n\n   That is also 6 moves: \n        turn20: U\n        turn21: S\n        turn22: D\n        turn23: S\n        turn24: S\n        turn25: U\n\n   Then same 8 moves.\n\n   So we can output that as well.\n\n   The actions:\n\n        Turn20: U\n        Turn21: S\n        Turn22: D\n        Turn23: S\n        Turn24: S\n        Turn25: U\n        Turn26: U\n        Turn27: U\n        Turn28: U\n        Turn29: U\n        Turn30: U\n        Turn31: U\n        Turn32: U\n        Turn33: U\n\nThis is also 14 moves.\n\nWe can choose any minimal path.\n\nWe'll choose the second one because it has fewer direction changes? But the problem doesn't care.\n\nWe'll output the first one we found.\n\nBut to be safe, let me check the safety for the second one:\n\n   turn20: U -> at21:1 -> safe (T=21: freeway1 safe)\n   turn21: S -> at22:1 -> safe (T=22: freeway1 safe)\n   turn22: D -> at23:0 -> safe (freeway0)\n   turn23: S -> at24:0 -> safe\n   turn24: S -> at25:0 -> safe\n   turn25: U -> at26:1 -> safe (T=26: freeway1 safe)\n   then the rest same.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nWe can output either.\n\nI'll output the first one.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have H=14.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 0\\) to avoid unsafe freeways during turns 23 to 25, waiting at \\(y = 0\\), and then moving up consecutively starting at turn 26 when the freeways become safe again.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 21, move down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) to avoid freeway 1 at turn 23 (unsafe).\n- At turns 22, 23, and 24, stay (S) at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid unsafe freeways during turns 23 to 25.\n- At turn 25, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 is safe at turn 26).\n- From turns 26 to 33, move up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 34. The freeways 1 to 8 are safe during these turns:\n  - Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe only at turns 23–25 and 32–34, but \\(y = 2\\) is reached at turn 27 (safe) and \\(y = 1\\) is left before turn 32.\n  - Freeways 3 and 4 are unsafe only at turns 24–25, and \\(y = 3\\) and \\(4\\) are reached at turns 28 and 29 (safe).\n  - Freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 22, and \\(y = 5\\) is reached at turn 30 (safe).\n  - Freeway 6 is always safe, and \\(y = 6\\) is reached at turn 31.\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe only at turn 22, and \\(y = 7\\) and \\(8\\) are reached at turns 32 and 33 (safe).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 14 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 24 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where for some car, 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new row until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the row I'm currently on when I land there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each turn, starting from t=24.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=24. For any future turn T, the car positions will be based on their state at t=24.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*(T - 24), τ - s*(T - 24)]\n\nBut looking at the data, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 2: same, right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 3: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 4: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 5: right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right, speed 3\n\nFreeway 7: right, speed 24\n\nFreeway 8: right, speed 24\n\nAll are right-moving. So for each car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s*(T - 24), h + s*(T - 24)] since for right-moving, it's [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] where Δt = T - 24.\n\nIn the car update rule, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nAnd head and tail: in the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). -48 is greater than -59? -48 > -59, yes, so head is the right end, tail left end for right-moving cars. Similarly, (24,13,right,4): 24 > 13, so head=24, tail=13.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head] at t1, and at T, it's [tail + sΔt, head + sΔt].\n\nBut collision occurs if 0 is in [tail + sΔt, head + sΔt] for some car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nSince I'm at (0, y_T), I collide if y_T is the freeway and 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at t=24. y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so no cars there. So at t=24, I'm safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nThe path is through y=1 to 8, where cars are.\n\nEach turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need min H to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and I start at y=0, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the rows.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway row y=1 to 8, at which times it is occupied by a car, meaning that for some car on that row, 0 is in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, but I just need if there is any car causing 0 to be covered at time T.\n\nFor each row and each time T, I can compute if the row is \"blocked\" at T, i.e., if there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] for Δt = T - 24.\n\nThen, when I am at row y at time T, I will collide if the row is blocked at T.\n\nBut I only care about the times when I am on a freeway row.\n\nAlso, since I move step by step, I need to ensure that at each step when I land on a row, it's not blocked.\n\nNow, let me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nSpeed 4 for all.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is [τ + 4*(T-24), h + 4*(T-24)]\n\nFor first car: τ = -59, h = -48\n\nSo span at T: [ -59 + 4(T-24), -48 + 4(T-24) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ = -23, h = -12? Wait, (-12, -23, right,4), so h=-12, τ=-23? -12 > -23, so head=-12, tail=-23.\n\nIn the state, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head is larger.\n\nSo car1: head=-48, tail=-59\n\nCar2: head=-12, tail=-23\n\nCar3: head=24, tail=13\n\nAll on freeway 1.\n\nNow, 0 in span if for some car, min(τ +4Δt, h+4Δt) <= 0 <= max, but since right-moving, τ +4Δt <= h +4Δt, so 0 in [τ +4Δt, h+4Δt] if τ +4Δt <= 0 <= h+4Δt.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's compute for each car when it covers 0.\n\nFor car1: τ +4Δt <= 0 <= h+4Δt ⇒ -59 +4Δt <= 0 <= -48 +4Δt\n\nSo -59 +4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +4Δt\n\nFrom 0 <= -48 +4Δt ⇒ 4Δt >= 48 ⇒ Δt >= 12\n\nFrom -59 +4Δt <= 0 ⇒ 4Δt <= 59? No:\n\n-59 +4Δt <= 0 ⇒ 4Δt <= 59 ⇒ Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so Δt <= 14 since integer turns? Δt is integer, T integer.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt = T - 24 integer.\n\nSo for car1: 0 <= -48 +4Δt and -59 +4Δt <= 0\n\nFirst inequality: 0 <= -48 +4Δt ⇒ 48 <= 4Δt ⇒ Δt >= 12\n\nSecond: -59 +4Δt <= 0 ⇒ 4Δt <= 59 ⇒ Δt <= 14.75, so Δt <= 14\n\nThus Δt = 12,13,14\n\nSimilarly, for car2: head=-12, tail=-23\n\n0 <= -12 +4Δt and -23 +4Δt <= 0\n\n0 <= -12 +4Δt ⇒ 12 <= 4Δt ⇒ Δt >= 3\n\n-23 +4Δt <= 0 ⇒ 4Δt <= 23 ⇒ Δt <= 5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nThus Δt =3,4,5\n\nFor car3: head=24, tail=13\n\n0 <= 24 +4Δt always true since 24 +4Δt >0 for Δt >=0\n\n-23 +4Δt <=0? 0 <= 24 +4Δt always, and 13 +4Δt <=0? 13 +4Δt <=0 ⇒ 4Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt>=0.\n\n0 in [τ +4Δt, h+4Δt] = [13 +4Δt, 24 +4Δt]\n\nSince both positive for Δt>=0, and 0 not positive, so 0 never in span for car3.\n\nSimilarly, car1 covers Δt=12,13,14\n\nCar2 covers Δt=3,4,5\n\nCar3 never.\n\nSo for freeway 1, blocked at T when Δt=3,4,5 (from car2) or Δt=12,13,14 (from car1)\n\nT = 24 + Δt, so at T=27,28,29 and T=36,37,38.\n\nT=24 + Δt, Δt=3,4,5 → T=27,28,29\n\nΔt=12,13,14 → T=36,37,38\n\nNow freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1? Look: freeway 2 has same entries: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSo identical to freeway 1, so same blocked times: T=27,28,29 and 36,37,38.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) all speed 6.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? (48,37,right,6) so head=48, tail=37? 48>37, yes.\n\nSpan [37 +6Δt, 48 +6Δt]\n\n0 in it? 37+6Δt <=0 <=48+6Δt? But 37+6Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1\n\nSpan [1+6Δt, 12+6Δt] >=1>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35\n\n0 in [ -35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt ]\n\nSo -35 +6Δt <=0 <= -24 +6Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -24 +6Δt ⇒ 24 <=6Δt ⇒ Δt >=4\n\nSecond, -35 +6Δt <=0 ⇒ 6Δt <=35 ⇒ Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nThus Δt=4,5\n\nSo at T=24+4=28, T=29? Δt=4,5 → T=28,29\n\nT=24+4=28, 24+5=29.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSo same, blocked at T=28,29.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) speed 12.\n\nFirst car: [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt] >0, no.\n\nSecond car: [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt] >0, no.\n\nThird car: [-35+12Δt, -24+12Δt]\n\n0 in it: -35+12Δt <=0 <= -24+12Δt\n\n0 <= -24+12Δt ⇒ 24 <=12Δt ⇒ Δt >=2\n\n-35+12Δt <=0 ⇒ 12Δt <=35 ⇒ Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so Δt <=2? Since integer, Δt=2? Let's see:\n\nΔt=2: -35+24= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔt=3: -35+36=1 >0, so -35+12Δt=1 >0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <=1 is true, but min is 1, max 12, 0 not in [1,12].\n\n[ -35+12Δt, -24+12Δt ]\n\nAt Δt=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [-11,0], so 0 is included? Since tail + sΔt = -11, head + sΔt =0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is the endpoint, included? Probably, since span includes endpoints I assume.\n\nSimilarly, collision if 0 is in the closed interval.\n\nSo at Δt=2: [ -11, 0], 0 is in it.\n\nAt Δt=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only Δt=2.\n\nNow Δt=2: T=24+2=26.\n\nFor freeway 5, only at T=26 it is blocked by the third car.\n\nFirst and second cars never cover 0.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,3) head=48, tail=37, speed 3.\n\nSpan [37+3Δt, 48+3Δt] >0 always, so never covers 0. So freeway 6 is never blocked.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24) head=-48, tail=-71, speed 24.\n\nSpan [ -71 +24Δt, -48 +24Δt ]\n\n0 in it: -71+24Δt <=0 <= -48+24Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -48+24Δt ⇒ 48 <=24Δt ⇒ Δt >=2\n\nSecond, -71+24Δt <=0 ⇒ 24Δt <=71 ⇒ Δt <= 71/24 ≈2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nΔt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2.\n\nAt Δt=2: [ -71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=1: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=26.\n\nFreeway 8: same car (-48,-71,right,24), so same, only blocked at T=26.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway row, the times when it is blocked (collision if on that row at that time):\n\ny=1: blocked at T=27,28,29,36,37,38\n\ny=2: same as y=1, T=27,28,29,36,37,38\n\ny=3: blocked at T=28,29\n\ny=4: same as y=3, T=28,29\n\ny=5: blocked only at T=26\n\ny=6: never blocked\n\ny=7: blocked at T=26\n\ny=8: blocked at T=26\n\ny=6 is never blocked, good.\n\nI start at y=0, t=24.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum moves to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, but since I want min time, probably go up as fast as possible, avoiding blocked times.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t=24 to t=24+H-1, and at turn t=24+H-1, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 in min steps.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=24, and I act at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position after action at t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nAfter action a_t, I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, I am on a freeway y_T, and that freeway is blocked at T.\n\nFor example, at t=24, I am at y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nI perform action a_{24}, which moves me to y_{25} at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 25, I am at y_{25}, and if y_{25} between 1 and 8, I need to check if freeway y_{25} is blocked at T=25.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no need to be on freeway.\n\nNow, min H: since I start at t=24, position y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at turn t=24 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=24, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=24, I go to y_{25} at t=25.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, I am at turn t=24 + k, with y_{24+k}.\n\nI want y_{24+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=24 to t=24 + (k-1), so H = number of actions, and at turn t=24 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: t=24, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions: actions at t=24, 25, ..., 24+H-1, resulting in y_{25}, y_{26}, ..., y_{24+H}.\n\nI want y_{24+H} =9.\n\nAnd H min.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from t=24 to t=24 + H -1, and at t=24 + H, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at t=24, y=0, not 9.\n\nIf I do U at t=24, then at t=25, y=1.\n\nThen if U again at t=25, at t=26, y=2, and so on.\n\nNow, to min H, I need to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is blocked.\n\nNow, the blocked times:\n\nList the freeway and when blocked:\n\ny=1: blocked T=27,28,29,36,37,38\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: blocked T=28,29\n\ny=4: blocked T=28,29\n\ny=5: blocked T=26\n\ny=6: never blocked\n\ny=7: blocked T=26\n\ny=8: blocked T=26\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\ny=5,7,8 blocked only at T=26.\n\ny=1,2 blocked at T=27-29 and 36-38, but since we are starting from t=24, and want min time, probably we don't care about later times like 36, since we can reach before that.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4 blocked at 28,29.\n\nNow, I start at t=24, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach step I can increase y by 1.\n\nMin steps: 9 ups, but I might need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can go directly to y=6 and stay if needed, but I need to get to y=9.\n\nAlso, from y=0 to y=1, etc.\n\nNow, let me think about the times.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=24: y=0, do U, go to y=1 at t=25\n\nt=25: at y=1, which is freeway. Is it blocked at t=25? From above, y=1 blocked at 27,28,29,36-38, not at 25. So safe. Then do U, go to y=2 at t=26\n\nt=26: at y=2. y=2 blocked at? T=27,28,29, etc., not at 26. At t=26, y=2 is not blocked, since blocked only at 27,28,29,36-38. So safe at t=26. Then do U, go to y=3 at t=27\n\nt=27: at y=3. y=3 blocked at T=28,29, not at 27? From above, y=3 blocked at 28,29, so at t=27 not blocked. So safe. Do U, go to y=4 at t=28\n\nt=28: at y=4. y=4 blocked at T=28,29. At t=28, blocked! So collision if I go to y=4 at t=28.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this path: at t=28, I am on y=4, which is blocked at T=28.\n\nSo I collide.\n\nIf I go up, at t=28 I land on y=4 which is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, at t=27 I was on y=3, not blocked, but at t=28 on y=4 blocked.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=4 at t=28 or t=29.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=28 or 29.\n\nBut in the direct path, I hit y=4 at t=28.\n\nNow, I could stay or move down to avoid.\n\nBut I want min time.\n\nAnother issue: at t=26, some rows are blocked.\n\nIn the above, at t=26, when I was on y=2, not blocked.\n\nBut y=5,7,8 are blocked at t=26.\n\nBut I am not on them.\n\nNow, back to min path.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 quickly and then to 9.\n\nBut from below, y=1 to 5 have some blocks.\n\nList the safe times for each row, or rather, when I can be on each row.\n\nSince I move step by step, I need to plan the path.\n\nI start at t=24, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=1 at some t.\n\ny=1 is blocked only at t=27,28,29,36,etc. So at t=25,26,30,etc. it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same.\n\ny=3 blocked at 28,29, so safe at t=25,26,27,30,... etc. except 28,29.\n\nAt t=27, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\ny=4 safe except t=28,29.\n\ny=5 blocked only at t=26, so safe at t=25,27,28,etc. except t=26.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 blocked at t=26, safe other times.\n\ny=8 blocked at t=26, safe other times.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach step, y changes by -1,0,1.\n\nTo min time, probably go up, but avoid the blocked times.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=4 at t=28 or 29.\n\nIn the direct up path, I reach y=4 at t=28, which is bad.\n\nSo I need to slow down or speed up.\n\nI can go faster? From t=24, I start at y=0.\n\nAfter first U, t=25 y=1\n\nThen U, t=26 y=2\n\nThen if I U, t=27 y=3\n\nAt t=27 y=3 is safe.\n\nThen if I U, t=28 y=4 blocked.\n\nSo I cannot go up to y=4 at t=28.\n\nI could stay on y=3 at t=28.\n\nAt t=27, I am at y=3, I choose S (stay), then at t=28, I am still at y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 at t=28: but y=3 is blocked at t=28! Yes, from above, blocked at 28 and 29.\n\nSo at t=28, if I am on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, to y=2, but y=2 at t=28: y=2 blocked at 28? y=2 blocked at 27,28,29? Earlier y=1 and 2 blocked at same times, T=27,28,29.\n\nAt t=28, y=2 is blocked.\n\nSo if at t=27 I am on y=3, and I choose to stay or down, I go to y=3 or y=2 at t=28, both blocked at t=28.\n\ny=2 blocked at 28, y=3 blocked at 28.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=2 or y=3 at t=28.\n\nAt t=27, if I am on y=3, I have to go up? But going up to y=4 at t=28 is also blocked.\n\ny=4 blocked at t=28.\n\nSo all options bad if I am on y=3 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=27, y=3 is safe, but the next step is problematic.\n\nI need to not be on rows 2,3,4 at t=28 and t=29, since all blocked.\n\ny=2,3,4 all blocked at t=28 and 29? Let's see:\n\ny=1 and 2 blocked at 27,28,29\n\ny=3 and 4 blocked at 28,29\n\nSo at t=28, y=1,2,3,4 all blocked.\n\nSimilarly at t=29.\n\nNow, at t=26, what is blocked? y=5,7,8 blocked at t=26.\n\ny=6 not blocked.\n\ny=1,2 not blocked at t=26.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=26, I am at y=2, which is not blocked, safe.\n\nThen at t=27, I go to y=3, which at t=27 is safe (since y=3 blocked at 28,29, not 27).\n\nThen at t=27, I am at y=3, safe. But for next action, if I choose U, go to y=4 at t=28 blocked.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=3 at t=28 blocked.\n\nIf I choose D, go to y=2 at t=28, but y=2 blocked at t=28.\n\nSo all choices lead to collision at t=28.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=3 at t=27, because I have no safe action for t=28.\n\nIf I am on y=3 at t=27, no matter what I do at t=27, at t=28 I will be on y=2,3, or 4, all blocked at t=28.\n\nTherefore, I must avoid being on y=3 at t=27.\n\nSimilarly, I should not be on rows near there at that time.\n\nI need to reach higher rows before t=28 or after t=29.\n\nBut t=28 and 29 are bad for rows 1-4.\n\nNow, t=26 has issues for rows 5,7,8.\n\nBut I can plan to be on safe rows at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=28 and 29, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo I need to be on y<=0 or y>=5 at t=28 and 29.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=5 to 9 safe except specific blocks.\n\ny=5 blocked only at t=26, so at t=28 it is safe.\n\ny=6 always safe, etc.\n\nSo at t=28 and t=29, I should be on y=0, or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=26, I should avoid y=5,7,8.\n\ny=5,7,8 blocked at t=26.\n\ny=6 safe, y=1,2,3,4 safe at t=26? y=1 and 2 blocked at 27,28,29, not 26. y=3 blocked at 28,29, not 26. y=4 blocked at 28,29, not 26. So all y=1-4 safe at t=26.\n\nOnly y=5,7,8 blocked at t=26.\n\nNow, I start from y=0 at t=24.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nMin steps: 9 ups, but with delays.\n\nPossible to go up to y=5 quickly or something.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 as soon as possible and stay there during bad times, then go to 9.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=6, min 6 steps.\n\nAt t=24, y=0.\n\nt=25: after U, y=1\n\nt=26: y=2 (if U)\n\nt=27: y=3 (if U)\n\nBut at t=27, if I am at y=3, I have problem for t=28.\n\nIf at t=26 I am at y=2, I could go to y=3 at t=27, but then stuck.\n\nAt t=26, I am at y=2, I could stay or go down, but that delays.\n\nFor example, at t=26, on y=2, I choose S, so at t=27, I am at y=2.\n\nBut y=2 at t=27: blocked? y=2 blocked at t=27, yes, from above.\n\nT=27 is blocked for y=1 and 2.\n\nSo if at t=27 I am on y=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=1 at t=27, y=1 blocked at t=27.\n\nSo at t=26, if I am on y=2, I cannot stay or go down; I must go up to y=3 at t=27.\n\nBut then on y=3 at t=27, which is safe, but then at t=28, I have no safe move.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on y=2 at t=26 or something.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nI need to be at higher y before t=27 or after t=29.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 or above at t=27, then I can be safe.\n\ny=5 at t=27: is it safe? y=5 blocked only at t=26, so at t=27 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8,9 all safe at t=27 except y=7 and 8 blocked at t=26, but t=27 safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 blocked only at t=26, so t=27 safe.\n\nSo if I can be at y=5 or higher at t=27, then at t=27 I am safe, and I can go up from there.\n\nThen at t=28, I can be on y=6 or higher, all safe except y=5,6,7,8: y=5 safe at t=28, y=6 always safe, y=7 safe at t=28 (blocked only t=26), y=8 safe at t=28.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nNow, can I reach y=5 by t=27?\n\nt=24: start y=0\n\nAfter action at t=24: go to y=1 at t=25\n\nAction at t=25: go to y=2 at t=26\n\nAction at t=26: go to y=3 at t=27\n\nBut y=3 at t=27, which is not y=5.\n\nI need to be at y=5 at t=27.\n\nFrom t=24 to t=27, I have 3 actions: at t=24,25,26 determining y at t=25,26,27.\n\nStart y_24=0\n\nAfter a_24, y_25 = 0 + Δy\n\nAfter a_25, y_26\n\nAfter a_26, y_27\n\nI want y_27 >=5.\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so max y_27 = y_24 + 3*1 = 3, if all U.\n\ny_27 <=3, since start from 0, after 3 steps, y=3 max.\n\nCannot reach y=5 by t=27.\n\ny_27 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, max y=3.\n\nSo I cannot be at y>=5 at t=27.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y<=3 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=27, y=1 and 2 are blocked, so I must be at y=3 at t=27, since y=0 or y=3? y=3 at t=27 is safe, but then I have the problem for t=28.\n\ny=0 at t=27: how? If I stay or go down, but from start.\n\nAt t=24, y=0.\n\nIf I do S at t=24, then at t=25, y=0.\n\nThen I can do U at t=25, to y=1 at t=26.\n\nThen at t=26, on y=1, which is safe at t=26 (not blocked), then I can do U to y=2 at t=27, but y=2 blocked at t=27, collision.\n\nIf at t=26 on y=1, I do S, stay at y=1 at t=27, blocked.\n\nOr D to y=0 at t=27, but y=0 is not freeway, safe, but then I am at y=0 at t=27, which is safe, but I need to go up later.\n\nThen at t=27, on y=0, I can go to y=1 at t=28, but y=1 blocked at t=28, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 at t=27, then at t=28, still y=0, safe, since not freeway.\n\nThen at t=28, I can go to y=1 at t=29, but y=1 blocked at t=29, collision.\n\ny=1 blocked at 27,28,29, so from t=27 to 29, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4 at t=28,29.\n\nBut at t=28 and 29, I can be on y=0 or y>=5.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo one way is to stay at y=0 during t=27,28,29.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=24: y=0, do S, stay at y=0 at t=25\n\nt=25: at y=0, do S, stay at y=0 at t=26\n\nt=26: at y=0, do S, stay at y=0 at t=27\n\nt=27: at y=0, do S, stay at y=0 at t=28\n\nt=28: at y=0, do S, stay at y=0 at t=29\n\nt=29: at y=0, now t=30, I can start going up.\n\nBut this is many turns, H large.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nI can go up to some point before.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=4 or something, but let's see.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and stay during bad times, but that takes time.\n\nOr, go to y=6 which is always safe.\n\nBut to go to y=6, I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nThe critical period is t=28 and 29 for rows 1-4.\n\nIf I can be on y=5 or above at t=28, then I am safe.\n\ny=5 at t=28 is safe, since blocked only at t=26.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8,9 all safe at t=28.\n\nNow, at t=28, what y can I be?\n\nFrom start t=24, after 4 actions, I can be at y=4 at t=28, for example.\n\nBut y=4 at t=28 is blocked, as we saw.\n\nIf I go slower, y less.\n\nBut I want y>=5 at t=28.\n\nMax I can be at t=28 is y=4, since from y=0, after 4 steps, y<=4.\n\ny_28 = y after 4 actions from t=24.\n\ny_24=0\n\na_24: y_25\n\na_25: y_26\n\na_26: y_27\n\na_27: y_28\n\nSo y_28 <=4.\n\nCannot be y=5 at t=28.\n\nSimilarly, at t=29, y_29 <=5.\n\nBut at t=29, if I am on y=5, it is safe, since not blocked.\n\ny=5 blocked only at t=26.\n\nSo possible to be at y=5 at t=29.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nNow, to be at y=5 at t=29.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=24, to y=5 at t=29, that takes 5 steps, but I can do it in 5 ups, but need to avoid blocks.\n\nFirst, let's list the actions to reach y=5 at t=29.\n\nStart t=24, y=0\n\nI need to have y_29 =5.\n\nThe position at each turn:\n\nt=24: y=0\n\nAfter a_24, y_25\n\nAfter a_25, y_26\n\nAfter a_26, y_27\n\nAfter a_27, y_28\n\nAfter a_28, y_29\n\nI want y_29=5.\n\nAlso, at each step, when on freeway, not blocked.\n\nNow, y_29=5, so from y_28, I go to y_29=5 by U or S or D, but since increasing, probably U from y_28=4 or S if y_28=5, but let's see.\n\nTo min time, I want to go up fast, but with constraints.\n\nThe constraining times are t=26, t=27, t=28.\n\nAt t=26, avoid y=5,7,8\n\nAt t=27, avoid y=1,2\n\nAt t=28, avoid y=1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, at t=29, avoid y=1,2,3,4 but since I want to be at y=5, it's ok.\n\nFirst, at t=25: I must be on some y.\n\nAfter a_24, at t=25, y_25.\n\ny_25 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nIf y_25=1, freeway, must not be blocked at t=25. y=1 not blocked at t=25, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y_25=0, safe.\n\ny_25=2, safe at t=25.\n\nNow, at t=26, y_26 must not be on blocked freeway: avoid y=5,7,8.\n\nSo y_26 can be 0,1,2,3,4,6,9 but y=9 not reachable yet, so 0,1,2,3,4,6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, y_27 must avoid y=1,2, so can be 0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 but realistically 0,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSince at t=27, y=1 and 2 blocked.\n\nAt t=28, y_28 must avoid y=1,2,3,4, so can be 0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=5 at t=29.\n\ny_29=5.\n\nSo at t=28, y_28 must be such that I can go to y_29=5.\n\nSo y_28 could be 4,5, or 6.\n\nIf y_28=4, then a_28=U to y=5\n\nIf y_28=5, a_28=S to y=5\n\nIf y_28=6, a_28=D to y=5\n\nBut since I want to min time, and go to 9, probably not down, so y_28=4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=28, y_28 must be in {0,5,6,7,8,9} to be safe.\n\nSo for y_28, it must be 5 or 6 or 0, etc., but if y_28=4, it is not in safe set, since y=4 blocked at t=28.\n\ny_28 must be in {0,5,6,7,8,9} for t=28.\n\nBut y_28=4 is not in this set, and if y_28=4, it is blocked, so I cannot have y_28=4.\n\nSimilarly, y_28=3,2,1 all blocked.\n\nSo y_28 must be 0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, for y_29=5, if y_28=5, then a_28=S, stay at 5.\n\nIf y_28=6, a_28=D to 5.\n\nIf y_28=0, a_28=U to 1, but y=1 at t=29 blocked, not good.\n\ny_28=0, then to go to y=5, I need to go up multiple steps, not in one action.\n\nFrom y_28, to y_29, only one action, so y_29 = y_28 + {-1,0,1}, so to have y_29=5, y_28 must be 4,5, or 6.\n\nBut y_28 cannot be 4, because y_28=4 is not in safe set for t=28.\n\ny_28 must be in {0,5,6,7,8,9}\n\nBut to have y_29=5, y_28 must be 4,5,6.\n\nThe intersection: y_28 can be 5 or 6.\n\ny_28=4 not possible because not safe.\n\ny_28=5 or 6.\n\nIf y_28=5, then a_28=S to y_29=5\n\nIf y_28=6, a_28=D to y_29=5\n\nNow, y_28=5 or 6.\n\nNow, similarly, I need to reach y_28=5 or 6 at t=28.\n\nt=28 is after 4 actions from start.\n\ny_28 <=4? From y=0, after 4 actions, max y=4.\n\ny_24=0\n\na_24: y_25 <=1\n\na_25: y_26 <=2\n\na_26: y_27 <=3\n\na_27: y_28 <=4\n\nSo y_28 <=4.\n\nBut y_28 must be 5 or 6 for the above, but 5 or 6 >4, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, I cannot have y_29=5 with y_28=5 or 6 because y_28 cannot be 5 or 6.\n\ny_28 max is 4.\n\nBut y_28=4 is not safe at t=28, and also not in the set to go to y_29=5 easily.\n\nIf I want y_29=5, I need y_28=4, but y_28=4 is blocked at t=28, so I cannot be on y=4 at t=28.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=5 at t=29 by going directly, because to reach y=5 at t=29, I must come from y=4,5, or6 at t=28, but y=4 not safe at t=28, y=5 or6 not reachable at t=28.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=5 at t=29.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at y=5 at t=28 or t=27 as we saw.\n\nNow, what about at t=30?\n\nAt t=30, I can be at y=5 or higher.\n\nAt t=30, all rows are safe except possibly, but from above, the blocks are only at specific times: y=1,2 blocked at 27,28,29; y=3,4 at 28,29; y=5 at 26; y=7,8 at 26. So at t=30, all freeways are safe, since 30 not in any block list.\n\nSimilarly, t=31, etc.\n\nSo at t=30, I can be on any y from 1 to 8 safely.\n\nNow, I can reach y=5 at t=30, for example.\n\nThen go to y=9.\n\nBut let's find the minimal H.\n\nFirst, to avoid the critical times, I can stay at y=0 until t=30 or something.\n\nBut that takes many turns.\n\nI can go up to y=6 before t=28.\n\nBut y=6 at t=27: possible?\n\ny_27 <=3, as max from start in 3 steps.\n\nCannot.\n\ny_27=3 max.\n\nAt t=27, I am at y=3, which is safe, but then at t=28, I have to move to a safe row.\n\nBut at t=28, safe rows are y=0 or y>=5.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=27, I can go down to y=2 or y=3 or up to y=4, but all not safe at t=28.\n\ny=2,3,4 all blocked at t=28.\n\nI cannot go to y=5 in one step from y=3.\n\nSo impossible to escape.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to not be on the critical rows at critical times, so I must be at y=0 at t=27, t=28, t=29.\n\nFor example, be at y=0 at t=27,28,29.\n\nThen at t=30, I can go up freely.\n\nSo let's plan that.\n\nStart t=24, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=27,28,29.\n\nAt t=24, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at t=24, a_24=S, then at t=25, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=25, if I stay, a_25=S, at t=26, y=0.\n\nAt t=26, on y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=26, I need to stay or move, but I want to be at y=0 at t=27, so at t=26, I can choose S, stay at y=0 at t=27.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, choose S, stay at y=0 at t=28.\n\nAt t=28, choose S, stay at y=0 at t=29.\n\nAt t=29, on y=0, I can start going up.\n\nNow, at t=29, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I can go up each turn to y=9.\n\nBut at t=29, when I go to y=1 at t=30, which is safe, since t=30 not blocked.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=31, safe, and so on, to y=9 at t=39.\n\nBut this takes many turns: from t=24 to t=39 for y=9, so H=15 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=38, 15 actions, to be at y=9 at t=39.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt t=26, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nInstead of staying, I could go up to y=1 at t=27, but y=1 at t=27 blocked, not good.\n\nMust stay at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, during t=27,28,29, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=0 from t=24 to t=29.\n\nt=24: y=0, do S, to y=0 at t=25\n\nt=25: y=0, do S, to y=0 at t=26\n\nt=26: y=0, do S, to y=0 at t=27\n\nt=27: y=0, do S, to y=0 at t=28\n\nt=28: y=0, do S, to y=0 at t=29\n\nt=29: y=0, do U, to y=1 at t=30\n\nt=30: y=1, do U, to y=2 at t=31\n\nt=31: y=2, do U, to y=3 at t=32\n\nt=32: y=3, do U, to y=4 at t=33\n\nt=33: y=4, do U, to y=5 at t=34\n\nt=34: y=5, do U, to y=6 at t=35\n\nt=35: y=6, do U, to y=7 at t=36\n\nt=36: y=7, do U, to y=8 at t=37\n\nt=37: y=8, do U, to y=9 at t=38\n\nSo at t=38, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=24 to t=37 inclusive? Actions at t=24 to t=37, that's 14 actions.\n\nt=24 to t=37 is 14 turns, actions at each, and at t=38, y=9.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut we can reach earlier by going during the safe periods.\n\nFor example, before t=27, I can go up to some safe row.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=2, for example, which is safe at t=26.\n\nThen from there, I need to get to a safe row for t=27, but at t=27, only y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8 are safe, but from y=2, I can go to y=3 at t=27, which is safe.\n\nBut then at t=27 on y=3, safe, but then for t=28, I have problem.\n\nUnless I can jump to y=5 or something, but I can't.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=27, I have to go to y=2,3, or4 at t=28, all blocked.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y=0 during t=27,28,29.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut at t=36,37,38, y=1 and 2 are blocked again, but in the above path, at t=36, I am at y=7, which is safe, t=37 y=8 safe, t=38 y=9 safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 blocked at 36,37,38, but I am not on them, so ok.\n\nBut in the above, it takes 14 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to y=6 before the bad times.\n\nBut I can't reach y=6 before t=27.\n\nMax at t=27 is y=3.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=2 or less.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 directly after the bad times, but I have to go through the rows.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 and then to 9 quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=6 from y=0, min 6 steps.\n\nIf I start at t=24, after 6 steps, at t=30, y=6.\n\nThen from there to y=9 in 3 steps, at t=33.\n\nBut at t=30, I can be at y=6.\n\nLet's see if I can be at y=6 at t=30.\n\nFrom t=24 to t=30, 6 actions.\n\ny_30 =6.\n\nAlong the way, avoid blocks.\n\nFor example, at t=25, I can be on y=1, safe if not blocked, which at t=25 is safe.\n\nt=26, avoid y=5,7,8, so be on y=1,2,3,4,6.\n\nt=27, avoid y=1,2, so be on y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt=28, avoid y=1,2,3,4, so be on y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nt=29, similar to t=28, avoid y=1,2,3,4, so y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, to reach y=6 at t=30.\n\nI can go up steadily.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=24: y=0, do U, to y=1 at t=25\n\nt=25: y=1, do U, to y=2 at t=26  (y=2 at t=26 safe)\n\nt=26: y=2, now I can do U to y=3 at t=27\n\nBut at t=27, y=3 is safe, as not blocked.\n\nThen t=27: y=3, do U to y=4 at t=28\n\nBut at t=28, y=4 is blocked! Problem.\n\nAt t=26, on y=2, I could do S, stay at y=2 at t=27, but y=2 blocked at t=27, collision.\n\nOr do D to y=1 at t=27, y=1 blocked at t=27, collision.\n\nSo at t=26 on y=2, I must go to y=3 at t=27 to avoid collision, but then at t=27 y=3 safe, but then to go to y=4 at t=28 blocked.\n\nStuck.\n\nAt t=25, on y=1, I could do S at t=25, to stay at y=1 at t=26.\n\nAt t=26, y=1 is safe, since not blocked.\n\nThen at t=26, on y=1, I can do U to y=2 at t=27, but y=2 blocked at t=27, collision.\n\nDo S, stay at y=1 at t=27, blocked.\n\nDo D to y=0 at t=27, then y=0 safe at t=27.\n\nThen at t=27, on y=0, I can do U to y=1 at t=28, but y=1 blocked at t=28, collision.\n\nDo S, stay at y=0 at t=28, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, on y=0, do U to y=1 at t=29, y=1 blocked at t=29, collision.\n\nDo S, stay at y=0 at t=29.\n\nThen at t=29, on y=0, do U to y=1 at t=30, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=1 at t=30, and I need to go to y=6.\n\nBut this is similar to before, and I wasted time.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=30, from above, if I go directly, I hit the block at t=28.\n\nSo I need to go slower or faster.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=4, for example.\n\nHow? From start.\n\nt=24: U to y=1 t=25\n\nt=25: U to y=2 t=26\n\nt=26: U to y=3 t=27\n\nBut at t=26, y=3? y_27=3.\n\nAt t=26, I am at y=2.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=26? Impossible, max y=2 at t=26.\n\ny_26 <=2.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=0,1,2.\n\nNone of which help for t=27.\n\nThe only safe position at t=27 is y=0 or y>=3, but y=3 and 4 are safe at t=27, but then problem at t=28.\n\ny=5 at t=27 not reachable.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to avoid the bad times without staying at y=0.\n\nTherefore, the minimal way is to stay at y=0 from t=24 to t=29, then go up to y=9 in 9 steps, reaching at t=38.\n\nH=14 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier by going to y=6 after.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can be on y=6 at t=30, for example.\n\nFrom t=29, I am at y=0.\n\nt=29: do U to y=1 at t=30\n\nt=30: U to y=2 at t=31\n\nt=31: U to y=3 at t=32\n\nt=32: U to y=4 at t=33\n\nt=33: U to y=5 at t=34\n\nt=34: U to y=6 at t=35\n\nThen to y=9 at t=38.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=30, I can go faster to y=6.\n\nFrom t=29 y=0, I do U to y=1 t=30\n\nBut I can do multiple ups.\n\nBut each action only one step.\n\nSo from y=0 at t=29 to y=6 at t=35, 6 steps.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps during the early turns, I can go up to y=4 or something, but at t=28 it will be blocked.\n\nUnless I go to y=5 before t=26.\n\nCan I reach y=5 by t=26?\n\nFrom t=24 y=0, after two actions: a_24 and a_25, to y_26.\n\ny_26 <=2, so at t=26 max y=2, cannot be y=5.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think 14 is the best.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=6 at t=30 with fewer delays.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=2 at t=26.\n\nThen at t=26 on y=2, I have to go to y=3 at t=27 to avoid being on y=2 at t=27 blocked.\n\nBut at t=27 on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=27, I have no good move for t=28.\n\nBut if at t=27 on y=3, I do nothing, but at t=28 on y=3 blocked.\n\nSo I must leave the row before t=28, but I can't.\n\nUnless I can be on a row that is safe at t=28, but from y=3, I can only go to 2,3,4, all not safe.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=0 during t=27,28,29.\n\nSo H=14.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nAt turn 37: U to y=9 at t=38.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=37, 14 actions.\n\nAt t=38, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=37, a_{37}, to go to y=9 at t=38.\n\nNow, is there a way with less than 14?\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=9 earlier by going during the gap.\n\nBut from t=24 to t=26, I can go up to y=2.\n\nThen I have to stay at y=0 from t=27 to 29, so same as before.\n\nAt t=26, I can be on y=6? No.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 directly and wait there, but to reach y=6, I need to go through the rows.\n\nFor example, from t=24 to t=26, I can be on y=2.\n\nThen at t=27, I go to y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I cannot stay, but if I could go to y=6, I can't.\n\nUnless I go to y=6 at a later time.\n\nI think it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps at t=26, I can be on y=4, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if at t=29, I can be at higher y.\n\nNo, at t=29, if I stay at y=0, y=0.\n\nSo I have to start from there.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 from higher, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=36, when I go to y=7, is it safe? y=7 at t=36.\n\ny=7 blocked only at t=26, so at t=36 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn.\n\nSuppose at t=28, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nInstead of staying at t=28, I can do nothing, but at t=29 I need to be at y=0.\n\nAt t=28, on y=0, I do S to y=0 at t=29.\n\nThen at t=29, U to y=1 at t=30.\n\nBut if at t=28, I could go to y=1 at t=29, but y=1 at t=29 blocked, not good.\n\nSo must stay.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=26, I am at y=0.\n\nInstead of staying, I could go to y=1 at t=27, but blocked.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fixed.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at t=26, but impossible.\n\nOr, let's list all possible y at each t.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince the only critical points are t=26 for y=5,7,8 and t=27-29 for y=1-4, and I can avoid by being at y=0.\n\nSo for min time, I stay low during bad times.\n\nThus, the sequence is:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nThen at turn 38, y=9.\n\nH=14 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from t=24 to t=24+H-1.\n\nHere actions from t=24 to t=37, so H=14.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 faster after t=29.\n\nFor example, from t=29 y=0 to t=30 y=1, t=31 y=2, ..., but same.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can go directly to y=6 if possible, but no shortcut.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must stay at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 27, 28, and 29 to avoid the critical periods when freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) are blocked.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 28, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at the same time, for a car on that freeway, 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D), at turn T the player is still on y_T. So at the moment of the move, the player is on the current freeway and then moves to the next. Therefore, we only check the freeway we are currently on for collision.\n\nWe are starting at y=0 at turn 28. We must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them. The goal is to get to y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: same y). But note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9. Since we start at 0 and want to go to 9, we are likely going to use U mostly.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the cars on freeways 1-8. So we may need to wait (stay) or even go down sometimes? But going down from 0 is not allowed (y>=0). So at y=0, we can only do U or S. Similarly, at y=9, we can only do D or S.\n\nOur actions will be taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nHow to approach?\n\nWe can simulate the future turns and check for collisions. Since the cars move at constant speeds, we can compute their positions at any future turn.\n\nLet t0 = t1 = 28. We are at turn 28 at position (0,0). We will consider each freeway and each car on that freeway and compute when the car's span covers 0 at a particular turn.\n\nNote: The cars are given at turn t1 (current turn). We need to compute their spans at any future turn T (relative to t1: T = t1 + dt, dt>=0).\n\nFor a car given at t1 with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n\nIf d is 'right', then at turn T (>=t1):\n  head_T = h + s*(T-t1)\n  tail_T = tau + s*(T-t1)\n  and the span is [min(tail_T, head_T), max(tail_T, head_T)]? But note the description:\n\nRight-moving: originally [tau, h] (so tau <= h) and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> so the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> and note that if it's left-moving, then h>=tau? Actually, the description says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> so h is the head and tau the tail? But in the example all are right-moving.\n\nLooking at the data: all cars in the current state are right-moving. So we only need to handle right-moving.\n\nFor a right-moving car at freeway k, given (h, tau, d='right', s) at turn t1=28, then at turn T (>=28):\n  head_T = h + s*(T-28)\n  tail_T = tau + s*(T-28)\n  and the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since tail_T <= head_T).\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\" and since originally [tau, h] and tau<=h, then at T: [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt] and tau+s*dt <= h+s*dt.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T on freeway k if the player is at y_T = k and 0 is in the span [tail_T, head_T] of at least one car on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving. We start at y=0 at turn 28.\n\nWe can consider a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach in the state (turn, y) but note that the turn can go up arbitrarily? However, we are looking for minimal turns so we can do BFS in terms of time.\n\nBut note: the state space in time is unbounded? However, we can set a reasonable bound. Since the player must go from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves (if we only go up). But we might have to wait. Also, the cars are moving and we might avoid by waiting. The maximum time we might wait? We can compute the periodicity of the cars? But note the speeds are constant and the cars are infinitely long? Actually, the cars are segments that move.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check for collisions until we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns). We can try to go as fast as possible (always U) and if we crash, then we try to wait at some safe spot.\n\nBut note: we start at y=0. We can only go to y=1 at the next turn (if we do U) or stay at 0 (if we do S). Then at y=1, we check collision with cars on freeway 1 at that turn.\n\nSo let's compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> at T: [ -59 + 4*(T-28), -48 + 4*(T-28) ]\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> [ -23 + 4*(T-28), -12 + 4*(T-28) ]\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> [ 13 + 4*(T-28), 24 + 4*(T-28) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> same as above\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 3: \n  car1: (48, 37, right, 6) -> [37 + 6*(T-28), 48 + 6*(T-28)]\n  car2: (12, 1, right, 6) -> [1 + 6*(T-28), 12 + 6*(T-28)]\n  car3: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> [-35 + 6*(T-28), -24 + 6*(T-28)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  car1: (48,37,right,6)\n  car2: (12,1,right,6)\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-28), 48+12*(T-28)]\n  car2: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*(T-28), 12+12*(T-28)]\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*(T-28), -24+12*(T-28)]\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,3) -> [37+3*(T-28), 48+3*(T-28)]\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-48,-71,right,24) -> [-71+24*(T-28), -48+24*(T-28)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nNote: The problem says that at turn T, if the player is at freeway k, then we check all cars on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's moves. We start at turn 28 at y=0.\n\nWe are allowed to do S or U at y=0. We cannot do D.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can try to go straight up without stopping. Let's check:\n\nAt turn 28: y=0 -> safe (since we are at y=0 and cars are on y=1..8)\n\nAt turn 28, we choose an action. Let's try U: then at turn 29, we will be at y=1.\n\nBut we must check at turn 29: are we on freeway 1? yes. Then check if 0 is in any car span on freeway 1 at turn 29.\n\nFor freeway 1 at T=29 (dt=1):\n  car1: [-59+4, -48+4] = [-55, -44] -> 0 not in this interval.\n  car2: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8] -> 0 not in [-19,-8]\n  car3: [13+4, 24+4] = [17,28] -> 0 not in [17,28]\nSo safe at turn 29.\n\nThen we can do U again at turn 29: then at turn 30, we are at y=2.\n\nCheck freeway 2 at turn 30 (dt=2 from 28? Actually, we are at turn 30: T=30 -> dt=2.\n\nFreeway 2 (same as freeway 1) at T=30:\n  car1: [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51, -40] -> 0 not in\n  car2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15, -4] -> 0 not in\n  car3: [13+8, 24+8] = [21,32] -> 0 not in\nSafe.\n\nAt turn 30: we do U -> turn 31: y=3.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 31 (dt=3):\n  car1: [37+6*3, 48+6*3] = [37+18,48+18] = [55,66] -> 0 not in\n  car2: [1+18, 12+18] = [19,30] -> 0 not in\n  car3: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in\nSafe.\n\nAt turn 31: U -> turn 32: y=4.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 32 (dt=4):\n  car1: [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> safe\n  car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe\n  car3: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> note: 0 is included? \n        The interval is [-11,0]. Since it's [a,b] inclusive? The problem doesn't specify open or closed. But typically, if the car spans from a to b, then it includes both endpoints. So 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo at turn 32, if we are at y=4, we collide with car3 on freeway 4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at turn 32.\n\nWe must avoid that. How? We can either not be at y=4 at turn 32, or wait at y=3 until it is safe to go to y=4.\n\nBut note: we are at y=3 at turn 31. We did U at turn 31 to go to y=4 at turn 32. Instead, we could do S at turn 31 to stay at y=3 for turn 32.\n\nBut we must check: at turn 32, if we are at y=3 (freeway 3), is it safe?\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 32 (dt=4):\n  car1: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n  car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe\n  car3: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0]? -> yes! \n  So at turn 32, freeway 3 also has a car covering 0? \n\nWait, freeway 3 at turn 32: \n  car3: [-35 + 6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\nSo if we stay at y=3 at turn 32, we also collide.\n\nWhat about staying at y=2? at turn 32? \nWe are currently at turn 31 at y=3. To be at y=2 at turn 32, we would have to do D at turn 31. But we are at y=3, so we can do D -> y=2 at turn 32.\n\nCheck freeway 2 at turn 32 (dt=4):\n  car1: [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43, -32] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo freeway 2 at turn 32 is not safe.\n\nWhat about y=1 at turn 32? \n  freeway 1 at turn 32 (dt=4):\n  car1: [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43,-32] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> collision.\n\ny=0 at turn 32? \n  y=0 is safe (no cars) but we are at turn 32 and we are at y=0. How did we get there? We would have to move down from y=1 at turn 31? But we were at y=3 at turn 31. We can only move to y=2 at turn 31 (if we do D) and then to y=1 at turn 32? But we are considering being at y=0 at turn 32: that would require two downs? Not possible from y=3 in one step? Actually, from turn 31 (y=3) we can do D to go to y=2 at turn 32, then at turn 32 we do D again to go to y=1 at turn 33? But we are looking at turn 32.\n\nAlternatively, we can only be at y=0 at turn 32 if we started at y=1 at turn 31 and did D? But we are at y=3 at turn 31. So we cannot be at y=0 at turn 32.\n\nSo at turn 32, the freeways 1,2,3,4 are all dangerous? \n\nLet me check freeway 4 again: we already saw freeway 4 car3: [-11,0] -> collision at y=4.\nFreeway 3: same car3: [-11,0] -> collision at y=3.\nFreeway 2: car2: [-7,4] -> 0 in the interval -> collision at y=2.\nFreeway 1: car2: [-7,4] -> 0 in the interval -> collision at y=1.\n\nWhat about freeway 5? We haven't been there yet. But we are not on freeway 5 at turn 32 if we are at y=5? But we are currently at y=3 at turn 31. We can only go to y=4 at turn 32 (if we do U) or stay at y=3 or go to y=2. We cannot get to y=5 in one move from y=3.\n\nSo at turn 32, no matter which freeway we are in (1,2,3,4) we are in danger? And we cannot be at y=5 or above. And we cannot be at y=0 because we are at y=3 at turn 31 and we can only go down to y=2 at turn 32, not to y=0.\n\nBut wait, we could have planned differently? We are at turn 31 at y=3. We must choose an action for turn 31. We tried U and it leads to crash at turn 32. If we do S, we crash at turn 32 (on freeway 3). If we do D, we crash at turn 32 (on freeway 2). So we must avoid being at any freeway 1-8 at turn 32? But that's impossible because we are at y=3 at turn 31 and we can only go to y=2,3,4 at turn 32.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at turn 31 at y=3? Then we must have arrived at y=3 at a different turn? Or we must have waited earlier.\n\nLet me check the previous steps again. We started at turn 28 at y=0.\n\nTurn 28: we did U -> turn 29: y=1 (safe)\nTurn 29: we did U -> turn 30: y=2 (safe)\nTurn 30: we did U -> turn 31: y=3 (safe)\n\nBut then at turn 31 we are stuck because at turn 32 we crash no matter what.\n\nTherefore, we must delay our arrival at y=3. How? We can stay at y=0 for one turn? or at y=1 or y=2 for an extra turn.\n\nLet me try: at turn 28: we do S (stay at y=0) for one turn. Then at turn 29, we are still at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 29: we do U -> turn 30: y=1.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at turn 30 (dt=2 from 28? Actually, turn 30: T=30, dt=2.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=30: \n  car1: [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4] -> safe\n  car3: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32] -> safe\nSo safe.\n\nThen turn 30: we do U -> turn 31: y=2.\n\nCheck freeway 2 at turn 31 (dt=3):\n  car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo at turn 31, if we are at y=2 (freeway 2) we collide with car2.\n\nSo we crash at turn 31.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 30 (after staying at turn 28 and then going to y=1 at turn 30) we could do S at turn 30? Then we would be at y=1 at turn 31.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at turn 31 (dt=3):\n  car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 in the interval -> collision.\n\nSo at turn 31, freeway 1 is also dangerous.\n\nTherefore, if we start by staying at turn 28, we still crash at turn 31.\n\nWhat if we stay two turns at the beginning? \n\nTurn 28: S -> y=0 at turn 29.\nTurn 29: S -> y=0 at turn 30.\nTurn 30: U -> y=1 at turn 31.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at turn 31 (dt=3): as above, car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nWe see that at turn 31 (dt=3) freeway 1 and 2 are dangerous because of the car2 in each? \n\nBut note: freeway 1 and 2 have the same car configuration. \n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway 1 or 2 at turn 31, and also freeway 3 and 4 at turn 32? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster? But we started at turn 28 and we are at y=3 at turn 31 (which is 3 moves: 28->29->30->31). We cannot go faster because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=4 earlier? But we were at y=3 at turn 31 and then we go to y=4 at turn 32 and crash on freeway 4.\n\nBut what if we get to y=3 earlier? We started at turn 28 at y=0. The earliest we can be at y=3 is turn 31 (by going U at 28,29,30). We cannot be earlier.\n\nSo we must avoid turn 31 on freeway 1 and 2, and turn 32 on freeway 1,2,3,4.\n\nWe must be at a freeway that is safe at that turn.\n\nIdea: maybe we can wait at y=0 for more turns? But we saw that if we wait, we still hit the same problem at turn 31 or 32.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=4 before turn 32? But we cannot because we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can go to y=5 or above to skip the dangerous freeways? But we have to go through them.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 31. We cannot jump to y=5 at turn 32. We can only go to y=4.\n\nBut what if we wait at y=3 for multiple turns? Then we would be at y=3 at turn 32, which we know is dangerous (because of car3 on freeway 3 at turn 32: [-11,0]). \n\nBut what about at turn 33? \n\nLet me compute freeway 3 at turn 33 (dt=5):\n  car1: [37+30,48+30]=[67,78] -> safe\n  car2: [1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe\n  car3: [-35+30, -24+30]=[-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo at turn 33, freeway 3 is still dangerous.\n\nTurn 34 (dt=6):\n  car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 34, freeway 3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 at turn 34 (same as freeway 3? no, freeway 4 has the same cars as freeway 3? yes, according to the table) -> so freeway 4 at turn 34: car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 2 at turn 34 (dt=6):\n  car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  car1: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe\n  car3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 1 same as 2: safe.\n\nSo if we wait at y=3 until turn 34, then we can move.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn 31. We need to wait two turns: turn 31 and turn 32 and turn 33? \n\nAt turn 31: we are at y=3. We do S at turn 31 -> then at turn 32, we are at y=3 (but freeway 3 at turn 32 is dangerous: [-11,0] -> collision). So we cannot do S at turn 31.\n\nWe must not be at y=3 at turn 32. We could move down to y=2 at turn 32? But freeway 2 at turn 32: car2: [-7,4] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\nOr move down to y=1 at turn 32? freeway 1 at turn 32: car2: [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1,2,3,4 at turn 32.\n\nThe only safe freeway at turn 32 might be y=0? But we can't get to y=0 from y=3 in one move? We can only get to y=2 at turn 32 from y=3 at turn 31 (by D) and then from y=2 we can't get to y=0 in one move.\n\nAlternatively, we could have been at a higher freeway? But we are at y=3 at turn 31, so we cannot be at y=5 at turn 32.\n\nSo how about we avoid being at y=3 at turn 31? \n\nWe were at y=2 at turn 30. Instead of moving up to y=3 at turn 31, we could have stayed at y=2 at turn 31? But we saw that freeway 2 at turn 31 (dt=3) is dangerous: car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nOr we could have moved down to y=1 at turn 31? freeway 1 at turn 31: same car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway 1 or 2 at turn 31.\n\nWe can try to be at freeway 3 at turn 31? But freeway 3 at turn 31 (dt=3) is safe? We computed earlier: at turn 31, freeway 3: \n  car1: [55,66] -> safe\n  car2: [19,30] -> safe\n  car3: [-17,-6] -> safe (0 not in [-17,-6])\nYes! So at turn 31, freeway 3 is safe.\n\nBut how to be at freeway 3 at turn 31? \n\nWe start at turn 28 at y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=3 at turn 31. That requires three moves up: \n  turn 28: U -> y=1 at turn 29\n  turn 29: U -> y=2 at turn 30\n  turn 30: U -> y=3 at turn 31\n\nBut then we are at y=3 at turn 31, which is safe (freeway 3 at turn 31: safe).\n\nThen at turn 31, we are at y=3. Now we want to avoid being at y=3 at turn 32? Because freeway 3 at turn 32 is dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 31, we can do:\n  Option 1: U -> then at turn 32, we are at y=4 -> but freeway 4 at turn 32: car3: [-11,0] -> collision.\n  Option 2: S -> then at turn 32, we are at y=3 -> collision.\n  Option 3: D -> then at turn 32, we are at y=2 -> freeway 2 at turn 32: car2: [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo we need to leave freeway 3 before turn 32? But we are there at turn 31 and we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can move up to y=4 at turn 31? But we are at turn 31 and we can only do one action: from y=3 we can go to y=4 at the next turn (turn 32). We cannot jump to y=4 at turn 31.\n\nSo we are stuck again? \n\nBut wait, at turn 31 we are safe at y=3. Then at turn 31, we do nothing? We have to do an action. And then at turn 32 we will be at either y=2,3,4 and all are dangerous.\n\nUnless there is a freeway that is safe at turn 32. We saw that freeways 1-4 are all dangerous at turn 32. What about freeway 5? \n\nFreeway 5 at turn 32 (dt=4):\n  car1: [37+12*4, 48+12*4] = [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe\n  car2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe\n  car3: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe (0 not in)\nSo freeway 5 is safe at turn 32.\n\nBut how to get to freeway 5 at turn 32? We are at y=3 at turn 31. To be at y=5 at turn 32, we would need to move up twice? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=5 at turn 32.\n\nThen freeway 6,7,8 at turn 32:\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: [37+3*4, 48+3*4]=[37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\nFreeway 7: [-71+24*4, -48+24*4] = [-71+96, -48+96] = [25,48] -> safe (0 not in)\nFreeway 8: same as 7: safe.\n\nBut we cannot be at freeway 6,7,8 at turn 32 because we are at y=3 at turn 31 and we can only get to y=2,3,4.\n\nSo we must find a way to be at a safe freeway at turn 32.\n\nLet me reexamine freeway 3 at turn 32: car3: [-11,0] -> dangerous. But what about freeway 4? same as freeway 3 -> dangerous.\n\nfreeway 2: car2: [-7,4] -> dangerous.\n\nfreeway 1: car2: [-7,4] -> dangerous.\n\nfreeway 5: safe, but we can't reach.\n\nSo turn 32 is a bad turn for freeways 1-4.\n\nWe must not be on freeways 1-4 at turn 32.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn 31. The only way is to be at y=0, but we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=3 at a later turn? But we are already at turn 31.\n\nMaybe we can slow down earlier so that we are not at y=3 at turn 31, but at a later turn. For example, be at y=3 at turn 34 which is safe.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at turn 34? \n\nFrom turn 28 to turn 34 we have 6 turns. We need to go from y=0 to y=3 in 6 turns? That means we would have to spend 3 turns moving up and 3 turns waiting somewhere.\n\nWe can wait at y=0 for 3 turns, then go up to y=3 in 3 turns. But then we are at y=3 at turn 34.\n\nLet's plan:\n\nTurn 28: S -> y=0 at turn 29.\nTurn 29: S -> y=0 at turn 30.\nTurn 30: S -> y=0 at turn 31.\nTurn 31: U -> y=1 at turn 32. \n  But freeway 1 at turn 32 (dt=4): car2: [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo we crash at turn 32.\n\nInstead, wait at y=0 for 2 turns and then move up slowly.\n\nTurn 28: S -> y=0 at turn 29.\nTurn 29: S -> y=0 at turn 30.\nTurn 30: U -> y=1 at turn 31.\n  freeway 1 at turn 31 (dt=3): car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nAgain crash.\n\nWait at y=0 for 1 turn and then go up to y=2 and wait there.\n\nTurn 28: S -> y=0 at turn 29.\nTurn 29: U -> y=1 at turn 30.\n  freeway 1 at turn 30 (dt=2): safe.\nTurn 30: U -> y=2 at turn 31.\n  freeway 2 at turn 31 (dt=3): car2: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nCrash.\n\nSo how to avoid turn 31 on freeway 2? We must be at freeway 3 at turn 31, but then we are safe at turn 31 but then we are in danger at turn 32.\n\n unless we can skip turn 32 by being in the air? But the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T. So at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nSo at turn 32, you are on the freeway of the y you are standing on at that turn.\n\nWe must be at a safe freeway at turn 32.\n\nWe saw freeway 5 is safe at turn 32. How to be at freeway 5 at turn 32? \n\nWe need to be at y=5 at turn 32.\n\nFrom turn 28 to turn 32: 4 turns. We need to go from y=0 to y=5 in 4 turns. That requires 5 moves? We have only 4 turns of actions: turn 28,29,30,31.\n\nActions:\n  turn 28: action -> turn 29: state\n  turn 29: action -> turn 30: state\n  turn 30: action -> turn 31: state\n  turn 31: action -> turn 32: state\n\nSo from turn 28 (y=0) to turn 32 (y=5) requires 5 moves? But we have only 4 actions. Impossible.\n\nMax we can be at y=4 at turn 32: because 4 moves: U at 28,29,30,31 -> y=4 at turn 32.\n\nBut we saw freeway 4 is not safe at turn 32.\n\n freeway 5 is safe but we can't reach.\n\nWhat about freeway 6,7,8? They are safe, but we can't reach them either.\n\nSo we must be at freeway 1,2,3,4 at turn 32 and they are all dangerous.\n\nThis suggests we need to be at a safe freeway at turn 32, but there is none among the ones we can reach.\n\nUnless we are at y=0 at turn 32? \n\nHow to be at y=0 at turn 32? \n  turn 28: y=0\n  turn 29: if we do S, y=0\n  turn 30: S, y=0\n  turn 31: S, y=0\n  turn 32: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 32, we are at y=0. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut the goal is to get to y=9 as fast as possible. This will take at least 9 more turns from turn 32, so total turns from turn 28: 4 (waiting) + 9 = 13 turns? But we might encounter more car problems.\n\nHowever, let's see if we can then move up safely.\n\nAfter turn 32, we are at y=0.\n\nWe want to go up. But we know that at turn 32+n, we need to check the freeways.\n\nFor example, at turn 33, if we do U, we will be at y=1 at turn 33.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at turn 33 (dt=5 from 28): \n  car1: [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway 1 at turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 34 (dt=6) for freeway 1: \n  car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n  so safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=1 at turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at turn 34 is safe (as above).\n\nSo plan from turn 32 onwards:\n\nTurn 32: at y=0.\nTurn 32: S (wait) -> turn 33: y=0.\nTurn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1. (freeway 1 at turn 34: safe)\nTurn 34: U -> turn 35: y=2. (freeway 2 at turn 35 (dt=7 from 28): \n  for freeway 2: \n    car1: [-59+28, -48+28] = [-31,-20] -> safe\n    car2: [-23+28, -12+28] = [5,16] -> safe\n    car3: [13+28,24+28] = [41,52] -> safe\n  so safe.\nTurn 35: U -> turn 36: y=3. \n  freeway 3 at turn 36 (dt=8): \n    car1: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe\n    car2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe\n    car3: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe\n  safe.\nTurn 36: U -> turn 37: y=4.\n  freeway 4 at turn 37 (dt=9): \n    car1: [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe\n    car2: [1+54,12+54]=[55,66] -> safe\n    car3: [-35+54, -24+54]=[19,30] -> safe\n  safe.\nTurn 37: U -> turn 38: y=5.\n  freeway 5 at turn 38 (dt=10): \n    car1: [37+120,48+120]=[157,168] -> safe\n    car2: [1+120,12+120]=[121,132] -> safe\n    car3: [-35+120, -24+120]=[85,96] -> safe\n  safe.\nTurn 38: U -> turn 39: y=6.\n  freeway 6 at turn 39 (dt=11): \n    car1: [37+3*11, 48+3*11]=[37+33,48+33]=[70,81] -> safe.\n  safe.\nTurn 39: U -> turn 40: y=7.\n  freeway 7 at turn 40 (dt=12): \n    car1: [-71+24*12, -48+24*12] = [-71+288, -48+288] = [217,240] -> safe.\n  safe.\nTurn 40: U -> turn 41: y=8.\n  freeway 8 at turn 41 (dt=13): \n    car1: [-71+24*13, -48+24*13] = [-71+312, -48+312] = [241,264] -> safe.\n  safe.\nTurn 41: U -> turn 42: y=9. -> goal.\n\nSo total turns from turn 28: \n  turn 28: S\n  turn 29: S\n  turn 30: S\n  turn 31: S  -> turn 32: y=0\n  then from turn 32 to turn 41: 10 actions? \n\nLet's count the actions from turn 28 to the action that gets us to y=9 at turn 42.\n\nAt turn 42, we have taken actions at turns: 28,29,...,41 -> 14 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe are spending 4 turns waiting at y=0 (turns 28,29,30,31) and then 9 turns moving up (turns 32 to 40: 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9) and then at turn 41 we do U to get to y=9 at turn 42.\n\nSo H = 14 turns.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe could try to be at y=3 at turn 34 (safe) and then move up.\n\nHow to be at y=3 at turn 34?\n\nFrom turn 28 to turn 34: 6 turns.\n\nWe need to move up 3 times and wait 3 times.\n\nExample:\n  turn 28: U -> turn 29: y=1 (safe, as before)\n  turn 29: U -> turn 30: y=2 (safe)\n  turn 30: S -> turn 31: y=2 \n     freeway 2 at turn 31 (dt=3): car2: [-11,0] -> collision. -> not safe.\n\nAnother try:\n  turn 28: U -> turn 29: y=1 (safe)\n  turn 29: S -> turn 30: y=1\n     freeway 1 at turn 30 (dt=2): safe.\n  turn 30: U -> turn 31: y=2\n     freeway 2 at turn 31 (dt=3): collision.\n\nAnother:\n  turn 28: S -> turn 29: y=0\n  turn 29: U -> turn 30: y=1 (safe)\n  turn 30: U -> turn 31: y=2 (collision on freeway 2)\n\nAnother:\n  turn 28: U -> y=1 at turn 29 (safe)\n  turn 29: U -> y=2 at turn 30 (safe)\n  turn 30: we cannot go to y=3 at turn 31 because then we are at y=3 at turn 31 (safe) but then turn 32 we are in danger. So we wait at turn 30: S -> turn 31: y=2 -> collision.\n\nSo it seems we cannot avoid the collision at turn 31 on freeway 2 if we are there.\n\n unless we wait at a safe freeway. But at turn 31, freeway 3 is safe, but to be at freeway 3 we must have moved up three times and be there at turn 31.\n\nThen at turn 31 we are at y=3 (safe). Now, to avoid turn 32, can we move to a safe freeway at turn 32? The safe freeways at turn 32 are y=5 and above, but we can't reach.\n\nWhat if we move down to y=2 at turn 32? But freeway 2 is dangerous.\n\nOr up to y=4: freeway 4 is dangerous.\n\nBut what about freeway 3 at turn 32: we know it is dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe freeway at turn 32 is y=0, but we can't reach.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option is to wait at y=0 until after turn 32.\n\nBut in our earlier plan, we waited at y=0 for turns 28,29,30,31 and then at turn 32 we are at y=0 and safe. Then we start moving.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 42.\n\nBut is there a way to start moving earlier? For example, at turn 32 we are at y=0. We have to wait at turn 32 because if we move up at turn 32, we will be at y=1 at turn 33, and freeway 1 at turn 33 is dangerous.\n\nSo we wait at turn 32: S -> turn 33: y=0.\nThen at turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1 (safe).\n\nSo the waiting at y=0 for turns 28,29,30,31,32: that's 5 turns of waiting.\n\nThen from turn 33 to turn 42: 10 actions? Let's count:\n\n  turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1\n  turn 34: U -> turn 35: y=2\n  turn 35: U -> turn 36: y=3\n  turn 36: U -> turn 37: y=4\n  turn 37: U -> turn 38: y=5\n  turn 38: U -> turn 39: y=6\n  turn 39: U -> turn 40: y=7\n  turn 40: U -> turn 41: y=8\n  turn 41: U -> turn 42: y=9\n\nSo from turn 28 to turn 41 we have actions for turns: 28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41 -> 14 actions.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn 42, which is after 14 actions.\n\nHowever, note that the player is at (0,9) at turn 42, which is after the action at turn 41.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions (turns we take actions) from turn 28 to the turn we reach y=9.\n\nWe take actions at turns: 28,29,...,41 (14 actions) and then at turn 42 we are at y=9. But the last action is at turn 41.\n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and then after H actions we are at (0,9).\n\nSo if we start at t1=28, and we take H actions, then at turn t1+H we are at (0,9).\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn 42 = 28 + 14.\n\nSo H=14.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Let me try to see if we can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose we wait only 3 turns at y=0: turns 28,29,30 -> then at turn 31, we are at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 31: U -> turn 32: y=1 -> but freeway 1 at turn 32 (dt=4): car2: [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo not safe.\n\nWait 4 turns: turns 28,29,30,31 -> turn 32: y=0.\n\nThen as above.\n\nOr wait 5 turns: turns 28,29,30,31,32 -> turn 33: y=0.\n\nThen at turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1 (safe) and then proceed as before, reaching y=9 at turn 43? That would be slower.\n\nSo our best is 14 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is a path with fewer than 14 turns.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 as fast as possible but then wait at y=4 at a safe turn.\n\nWe can be at y=4 at turn 32 by: \n  turn 28: U -> y=1 at 29\n  turn 29: U -> y=2 at 30\n  turn 30: U -> y=3 at 31\n  turn 31: U -> y=4 at 32 -> but freeway 4 at turn 32: dangerous.\n\nThen if we wait at y=3 until turn 34: \n  turn 28: U->29: y1\n  turn 29: U->30: y2\n  turn 30: U->31: y3\n  turn 31: S->32: y3 (dangerous at turn 32? freeway 3 at turn 32: [-11,0] -> collision) -> cannot.\n  turn 31: D ->32: y2 (dangerous) or U->32: y4 (dangerous).\n\nSo we cannot wait at y=3 for the extra turns.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=5 and then wait? \n\nTo be at y=5 at turn 32: \n  turn 28: U->29: y1\n  turn 29: U->30: y2\n  turn 30: U->31: y3\n  turn 31: U->32: y4 -> then we need to do another U at turn 32 to get to y5 at turn 33? \n  But at turn 32 we are at y4 and in danger.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go up to y=5 in 5 turns: \n  turn 28: U->29: y1\n  turn 29: U->30: y2\n  turn 30: U->31: y3\n  turn 31: U->32: y4 (danger) -> not safe.\n\nOr with waiting:\n  turn 28: U->29: y1\n  turn 29: S->30: y1 (at turn 30: freeway 1 safe? at dt=2: safe)\n  turn 30: U->31: y2 (danger at turn 31 on freeway 2) -> not safe.\n\nSo it seems we cannot avoid the initial waiting.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 and then after the danger passes at turn 32, we move up.\n\nAnd we did that with 14 turns.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S   [we are at y=0 at turn 33? No: at turn 32 we did S, so we are at y=0 at turn 32? Let me clarify the state after action.\n\nWe start at turn 28: at (0,0). \nAfter action at turn 28: \n  if we do S, then at the beginning of turn 29 we are at (0,0).\n\nBut the collision check is at the turn when we are at the freeway.\n\nSo after action at turn 28 (S), we are at y=0 at turn 29? Actually, the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nWe are at turn t: we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 28, we are at y_28=0.\nWe do a_28 = S: then y_29 = 0.\nThen at turn 29, we are at (0,0) and we do a_29, etc.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn 28: we do S -> then at turn 29, we are at y=0.\nAt turn 29: S -> turn 30: y=0.\nAt turn 30: S -> turn 31: y=0.\nAt turn 31: S -> turn 32: y=0.  [now turn 32: we are at y=0, safe]\nAt turn 32: we do S -> then at turn 33, we are at y=0. \n  But we don't want to wait that extra turn? \n\nIn our earlier simulation, we did:\n  turn 32: S -> turn 33: y=0\n  turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1\n\nBut we can at turn 32: do U -> then at turn 33, we are at y=1.\n  freeway 1 at turn 33 (dt=5): car2: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\nSo we must not do U at turn 32.\n\nSo we have to do S at turn 32 to stay at y=0 at turn 33.\n\nThen at turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1 (safe).\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S   [now at turn 33, y=0]\nTurn 33: U   [at turn 34, y=1]\nTurn 34: U   [turn 35, y=2]\nTurn 35: U   [turn 36, y=3]\nTurn 36: U   [turn 37, y=4]\nTurn 37: U   [turn 38, y=5]\nTurn 38: U   [turn 39, y=6]\nTurn 39: U   [turn 40, y=7]\nTurn 40: U   [turn 41, y=8]\nTurn 41: U   [turn 42, y=9]\n\nSo 14 actions: turns 28 to 41.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence from turn t1 (28) to turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe have H=14, so the last action is at turn 28+13=41.\n\nThe actions are for turns: 28,29,...,41.\n\nNow, we must verify that there are no collisions.\n\nWe already checked the critical points. Let's recheck a few:\n\nAt turn 34 (y=1): freeway 1 at turn 34 (dt=6 from 28): \n  car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn 35 (y=2): freeway 2 at turn 35 (dt=7): \n  car2: [-23+28, -12+28]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\nAt turn 36 (y=3): freeway 3 at turn 36 (dt=8): \n  car3: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn 37 (y=4): freeway 4 at turn 37 (dt=9): \n  car3: [-35+54, -24+54]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAnd at the waiting turns (turns 28 to 32: y=0) no collision.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? For example, can we reduce the waiting at y=0?\n\nSuppose we only wait 3 turns at y=0: turns 28,29,30 -> then at turn 31: we are at y=0.\n\nThen at turn 31: we do U -> turn 32: y=1 -> collision at freeway 1 (car2: [-7,4] at turn 32).\n\nSo not safe.\n\nWhat if we wait 4 turns: turns 28,29,30,31 -> turn 32: y=0 (safe).\n\nThen at turn 32: we do U -> turn 33: y=1 -> collision (freeway 1 at turn 33: car2: [-3,8]).\n\nSo we have to wait at turn 32: do S -> turn 33: y=0.\n\nThen turn 33: U -> turn 34: y=1 (safe).\n\nSo we cannot skip the S at turn 32.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut we have 14 actions: from turn 28 to 41.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: S\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n}\n\nBut we must ensure that we reach y=9 at turn 42, which is after the last action (at turn 41).\n\nAnd the last action (U at turn 41) moves us from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAnd we checked that at turn 41 we are at y=8 and then we move to y=9 at turn 42. We don't check freeway 8 at turn 42 because we are at y=9 then? But the goal is to be at (0,9) and we are there at turn 42.\n\nAnd note that at turn 42, we are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8, and y=9 is the goal, not a freeway). So no collision check at turn 42.\n\nSo it should be safe.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 14. The sequence of actions is designed to wait at \\(y = 0\\) until the dangerous periods for the freeways have passed, then move upward safely.\n\nThe dangerous periods are:\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe at turns 31 and 32 due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeways 3 and 4 are unsafe at turn 32 due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n\nBy waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 28 to 32 (5 turns), the player avoids these dangers. Starting from turn 33, moving upward sequentially ensures safety, as verified for each freeway at the respective turns.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turns 28 to 32: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid collisions.\n- Turns 33 to 41: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 42.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: S \\\\\nTurn 29: S \\\\\nTurn 30: S \\\\\nTurn 31: S \\\\\nTurn 32: S \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, and we must avoid collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, the car on freeway k has its span covering 0 (i.e., 0 is in [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving, but note the update rule: for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]). However, note the car update rules:\n\nFor a right-moving car initially (at t1) with head h, tail tau (and note that for right-moving, the head is the front so h>tau? Actually, the representation is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). In the update:\n- Right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for the right-moving car: the example gives (head, tail, direction, speed). In the initial state at t1, the car is at [head, tail] but for right-moving, the head is the front? Actually, the update rule says: \n  For right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo in the table, for a right-moving car, the representation is given as (h, tau, right, s) meaning that at time t1, the car occupies [tau, h] (because the update rule says: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" for right-moving). But wait, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, ...)\" and then the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h]. So in the data, the first number is the head (front) and the second is the tail (back). Therefore, for a right-moving car at time t1, the car spans from tau to h (with tau <= h).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, tau] and then update by subtracting. But note: there are no left-moving cars in this problem? All cars are right-moving.\n\nSo collision condition for a freeway k at turn T: if the player is on y_T = k, then we require that for every car on freeway k, 0 is not in the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nBut note: the player moves at the same time as the cars? The update is simultaneous? The problem says: at turn T, the car span is updated to T, and then collision is checked at turn T: if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is a freeway (1..8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and the car positions at turn T.\n\nOur goal: start at (0,0) at turn 48 (t1=48). We take actions for t=48,49,... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn t1 (48) until the turn when we first reach 9.\n\nWe are at (0,0) at turn 48. We want to get to (0,9). The actions are U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay). But note: y is in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nPlan: We need to go from y=0 to y=9. We have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at times when there is a car at position 0 on that freeway.\n\nWe are allowed to wait (by using S) and also to go down? But since we start at 0 and want to go to 9, going down would be to negative? No, because y is bounded: if at 0 and we do D, we stay at 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but then clipped to [0,9]? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if at 0 and we do D, we remain at 0. Similarly, at 9 and we do U, we remain at 9.\n\nTherefore, we can only move up, down (but at 0 down is same as stay) or stay.\n\nBut note: the goal is at 9. So we must eventually go up.\n\nHowever, we might need to wait at some y (like 0 or 9) to avoid cars.\n\nBut note: at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? The cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can wait at 0 or 9 without any collision.\n\nThe problem: we start at (0,0) at turn 48. We can wait at 0 as long as we want? Then when to move?\n\nWe need to go through y=1 to 8 at some turns. At each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and at the turn T when we are on k, we must not have a car on k at T that covers 0.\n\nWe have the car data for each freeway at turn t1 (48). Then we can compute the position of each car at any turn T (>=48).\n\nLet's denote T (relative to t1): let t = T - t1, so at t=0 (T=48), the car positions are as given.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with initial (at T=48) head h, tail tau, direction right, speed s, then at time T (so t = T-48), the car occupies [tau + s*(T-48), h + s*(T-48)].\n\nWe need that at the turn T when we are on freeway k, 0 is not in [tau + s*(T-48), h + s*(T-48)].\n\nNote: the car spans are continuous? But they are given as integer positions? The grid is discrete? The problem says \"vertical axis y = 0,1,...,9\" but the car positions are given with integers? And the movement is by integers? So the car spans are integer intervals.\n\nBut note: the head and tail are integers, and speed is integer, and T-48 is integer. So the span is [a, b] where a and b are integers.\n\nWe must avoid being at (0,k) at turn T if for any car on freeway k, 0 is in [a,b] (i.e., a <= 0 <= b).\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway. Since the freeways 1 to 8 are independent, we need to know for each freeway k and for each time T (>=48) whether there is a car that covers 0 at that time.\n\nBut note: multiple cars per freeway? Yes, for example freeway 1 has three cars.\n\nSo for freeway k, we have a set of cars. At time T, if any one of them covers 0, then we cannot be on k at T.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves from y=0 at T=48 to y=9 at the earliest possible H.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up every turn: from 0 to 9 in 9 moves: 0->1->2->...->9). But we might have to wait at some freeway because of cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search: state = (y, t) where t is the turn (relative to t1=48, or absolute T). We start at (0,48). We want to reach (9, T) for some T. The actions: U, D, S. We have constraints: at state (y, T), if y is between 1 and 8, then we must not have any car on freeway y at turn T that covers 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each time T (starting from 48) whether the freeway is safe (i.e., no car on k at T covers 0). We can compute a set of unsafe (k, T) pairs.\n\nBut note: the time T can be large? However, we are going to move from 0 to 9 in at most, say, 20 steps? Because we can go up to 9 steps, but we might wait. But we can wait arbitrarily? Then we need to find the minimal T such that there is a path from (0,48) to (9, T) that avoids unsafe states.\n\nBut note: the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, each car has a constant speed. The unsafe condition for a particular car on a freeway is periodic? Actually, the car moves at constant speed, so the condition for 0 being in the car's span is periodic? But the period would be the time it takes for the car to move one full cycle? However, note that the grid is infinite? The car moves continuously? But we are only concerned at integer times.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway k, the set of times T (>=48) when the freeway is unsafe (because at least one car covers 0). Then we know that we cannot be at freeway k at those times.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. So for each freeway k, we can compute the unsafe times.\n\nLet me define for freeway k: the set of T (>=48) such that freeway k is unsafe at T.\n\nThen, we can plan a path: we start at y0=0 at T0=48. We can do actions: U, D, S. The next state: (y1, T1) = (y0 + a, T0+1) where a is -1,0,1 (but clipped to [0,9]).\n\nWe want to get to (9, T) for the smallest T.\n\nWe can do BFS (breadth-first search) over states (y, t) where t is the absolute turn. But note: t can be large? But we can bound the time: we know that we can wait at 0 arbitrarily, but we want minimal time. Also, we can also wait at 9 arbitrarily. But we want to minimize the total turns. So we can set an upper bound: the minimal H is at least 9. We can try to see if we can do H=9, then H=10, etc.\n\nBut note: the car patterns: we can compute the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway k the set of T (>=48) such that there is a car on k that covers 0 at T.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: \ncar1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> at time T: [tau + 4*(T-48), h + 4*(T-48)] = [-59 + 4*(T-48), -48 + 4*(T-48)]\ncar2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> [-23 + 4*(T-48), -12 + 4*(T-48)]\ncar3: (24, 13, right, 4) -> [13 + 4*(T-48), 24 + 4*(T-48)]\n\nWe need to check for each car if 0 is in the interval.\n\nCar1: -59 + 4*(T-48) <= 0 <= -48 + 4*(T-48)\n=> \n  -59 + 4*(T-48) <= 0  => 4*(T-48) <= 59 => T-48 <= 59/4 = 14.75 => T-48 <= 14 (since integer) => T <= 48+14 = 62\n  and 0 <= -48 + 4*(T-48) => 48 <= 4*(T-48) => 12 <= T-48 => T>=60.\n\nSo for car1: T in [60, 62] (because T-48 must be at least 12 and at most 14).\n\nCheck: T=60: [ -59+4*12 = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> 0 is in [ -11, 0]? Yes, because the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"0 is in the span\", and the span is [a,b] meaning a<=x<=b? So 0 is included at T=60? But note: at T=60: the interval is [-11,0]. So 0 is included? But the representation: the head at T=60 is 0? Then the car is at positions from -11 to 0? So position 0 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=61: [ -59+4*13 = -59+52 = -7, -48+52=4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> yes.\nT=62: [ -59+4*14 = -59+56 = -3, -48+56=8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> yes.\nT=63: [ -59+4*15 = -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe for car1.\n\nBut we have three cars. We need if any car covers 0.\n\nCar2: [-23+4*(T-48), -12+4*(T-48)]\nSet: -23+4*(T-48) <= 0 <= -12+4*(T-48)\n=> \n  -23+4*(T-48) <=0 => 4*(T-48)<=23 => T-48<=5.75 => T<=53\n  0<=-12+4*(T-48) => 12<=4*(T-48) => T-48>=3 => T>=51.\n\nSo T in [51,53].\n\nCar3: [13+4*(T-48), 24+4*(T-48)]\nThis car is moving to the right. At T=48, it's [13,24] which is positive. We require 0 in [13+4*(T-48), ...]. But 13+4*(T-48) >=13 (for T>=48) so 0 is never in this interval.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, unsafe at T in [51,53] (from car2) and [60,62] (from car1).\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? The table says:\n| 2 | same three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4) |\nSo same as freeway 1: unsafe at T in [51,53] and [60,62].\n\nFreeway 3: \ncars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(T-48), 48+6*(T-48)]\nSet 0 in [37+6*(T-48), 48+6*(T-48)]\nBut 37+6*(T-48) >=37 (for T>=48) so never.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-48), 12+6*(T-48)]\nSet: 0 in [1+6*(T-48), ...] -> 1+6*(T-48) >=1 -> never.\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*(T-48), -24+6*(T-48)]\nSet: -35+6*(T-48) <=0<=-24+6*(T-48)\n=>\n  -35+6*(T-48)<=0 => 6*(T-48)<=35 => T-48 <= 35/6 ≈ 5.83 -> T<=53\n  0<=-24+6*(T-48) => 24<=6*(T-48) => T-48>=4 => T>=52.\n\nSo T in [52,53].\n\nTherefore, freeway 3 unsafe at T=52,53.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? The table says same three cars. So unsafe at T=52,53.\n\nFreeway 5: \ncars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nCar1: [37+12*(T-48), 48+12*(T-48)] -> always positive -> safe.\nCar2: [1+12*(T-48),12+12*(T-48)] -> always positive -> safe.\nCar3: [-35+12*(T-48), -24+12*(T-48)]\nSet: -35+12*(T-48)<=0<=-24+12*(T-48)\n=>\n  -35+12*(T-48)<=0 => 12*(T-48)<=35 => T-48<=35/12≈2.91 -> T<=50 (since T-48 integer: 0,1,2)\n  0<=-24+12*(T-48) => 24<=12*(T-48) => T-48>=2 => T>=50.\n\nSo T=50: \n  lower: -35+12*2 = -35+24=-11, upper: -24+24=0 -> 0 is included? [ -11,0] -> yes.\nBut T=50: then T-48=2 -> so T=50 is the only one? T=50: [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nT=49: T-48=1 -> [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\nT=51: T-48=3 -> [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 5: unsafe only at T=50.\n\nFreeway 6: \nonly one car: (48,37,right,3) -> [37+3*(T-48), 48+3*(T-48)]\nSet: 0 in [37+3*(T-48), ...] -> 37+3*(T-48)>=37 -> never. So freeway 6 is always safe? \n\nBut note: at T=48: the car is at [37,48] -> safe. And as time increases, it moves to the right.\n\nFreeway 7: \ncar: (-48,-71,right,24) -> [-71+24*(T-48), -48+24*(T-48)]\nSet: -71+24*(T-48)<=0<=-48+24*(T-48)\n=>\n  -71+24*(T-48)<=0 => 24*(T-48)<=71 => T-48<=71/24≈2.95 -> T<=50 (T-48=0,1,2)\n  0<=-48+24*(T-48) => 48<=24*(T-48) => T-48>=2 => T>=50.\n\nSo T=50: \n  lower: -71+24*2 = -71+48=-23, upper: -48+48=0 -> [ -23,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\nT=49: T-48=1 -> [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24] -> safe.\nT=51: T-48=3 -> [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 7: unsafe at T=50.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: unsafe at T=50.\n\nSummary of unsafe (freeway, time) pairs:\n\nk=1: [51,53] and [60,62]\nk=2: [51,53] and [60,62]\nk=3: [52,53]\nk=4: [52,53]\nk=5: [50]\nk=6: always safe\nk=7: [50]\nk=8: [50]\n\nNow, we want to go from y=0 at T=48 to y=9 at some T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path. We want the minimal H (number of turns, so T from 48 to 48+H-1, and at turn 48+H-1 we are at 9).\n\nWe start at T=48, y=0.\n\nWe can do BFS: states (y, T) where T>=48, y in [0,9]. We start at (0,48). Then we try actions U, D, S.\n\nBut note: at y=0, D and S are equivalent: both keep at 0. Similarly at y=9, U and S keep at 9.\n\nWe want the minimal T such that we reach (9, T). Actually, H = T - 48 + 1? Because at turn 48 we are at step 0, then we do H actions? The problem says: we start at turn t1 (48) and we do actions for t=48, 48+1, ... until 48+H-1, so the last action is at turn 48+H-1, and then after that we are at y=9. So the turn we are at 9 is 48+H. But note: the state is updated at the same turn? \n\nActually, the update: at turn T, we choose an action a_T, then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta. So the position at the next turn (T+1) is updated.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning that we take H actions: at time t1 (48) we take a_48, then at 49 we take a_49, ... until a_{48+H-1}. Then after the last action, we are at (0,9). So the turn when we are at (0,9) is T = 48+H.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, we are at (0, y_T). And the action at T (if we take one) will then update to y_{T+1}. But note: we are at (0, y_T) at the beginning of turn T? Actually, the problem states: we are given the state at turn t1 (48). Then we choose an action for turn t1 (48), and then we update to turn t1+1. So at turn 48, we are at (0,0). Then we choose a_48, then we move to (0, y_49) at turn 49. But the collision condition: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). So at turn 48, we are at (0,0) and there is no car at freeway 0 (since freeways are 1-8) so safe. Then we choose an action, and at turn 49 we are at (0, y_49). Then we check collision at turn 49: if y_49 is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at turn 49.\n\nTherefore, the state (y, T) means: at turn T, we are at y. And we are safe at T if either y=0 or y=9 or y in [1,8] and the freeway y is safe at T.\n\nWe start at (0,48): safe.\n\nWe take an action at turn T to move to next state at T+1.\n\nWe want to reach (9, T) for some T.\n\nWe are going to do BFS in the state (y, T) for T starting from 48. Since we want minimal T, we can do BFS by increasing T.\n\nWe note that we can wait arbitrarily at 0 and 9, so we must avoid infinite loops. But since we are doing BFS by T, we will eventually find the minimal T.\n\nBut note: the unsafe times are only in the near future? The unsafe times we computed are only up to 62? And beyond 62, freeways 1 and 2 have no unsafe times? Actually, freeway 1 and 2: the next unsafe time after 62? Let me check.\n\nFor freeway 1, car1: we had T in [60,62]. What about later? \ncar1: the condition: \n  -59+4*(T-48) <=0<=-48+4*(T-48)\n=> 48 <= 4*(T-48) <=59  => 12 <= T-48 <= 14.75 -> only T-48=12,13,14 -> T=60,61,62.\n\nSimilarly, car2: T in [51,53] and then? The car moves away and never comes back? Because it's moving to the right at speed 4, so once it passes 0, it won't come back? Similarly, the other cars? So no periodicity? \n\nTherefore, for T>62, freeway 1 and 2 are safe? Similarly for others, the unsafe times are only in [50,53] and [60,62]. So beyond 62, all freeways are safe? \n\nFreeway 6 is always safe. \n\nSo we only need to consider T from 48 to, say, 70? But we want the minimal T, so we can search until we find a path.\n\nWe start at (0,48). We can do:\n\nAction at T=48: \n  U: then y_49 = 0+1 = 1 -> then at turn 49, we are at freeway 1. But freeway 1: unsafe at T=49? From above: freeway 1 unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62]. So T=49 is safe? Then state (1,49) is safe? \n  D: stays at 0 -> state (0,49)\n  S: stays at 0 -> state (0,49)\n\nWe want to minimize T, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nOption 1: go up as fast as possible, without waiting.\n\nStart: T=48, y=0 -> safe.\nT=48: do U -> T=49, y=1 -> check freeway 1: safe? (since unsafe only at [51,53] and [60,62]) -> safe.\nT=49: do U -> T=50, y=2 -> freeway 2: unsafe at T=50? From above: freeway 2 unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62] -> so T=50 is safe? Then safe? \nBut wait: freeway 2: unsafe at T=50? We computed for freeway 2: same as freeway 1: unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62]. So T=50 is safe.\n\nBut note: freeway 5,7,8 are unsafe at T=50, but we are at freeway 2 at T=50 -> so we don't care about freeway 5,7,8? We only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nSo at T=50, we are at freeway 2 -> safe.\n\nThen T=50: do U -> T=51, y=3 -> freeway 3: unsafe at T=51? We computed freeway 3 unsafe at [52,53] -> so T=51 is safe? Then safe.\nT=51: do U -> T=52, y=4 -> freeway 4: unsafe at T=52? Yes, because freeway 4 unsafe at [52,53] -> unsafe! So we cannot be at freeway 4 at T=52.\n\nSo we have to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up without waiting.\n\nWe need to wait somewhere.\n\nWe can try to slow down.\n\nFor example, at T=48: we do S (stay at 0) -> then T=49, y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at T=49: we can do U -> T=50, y=1 -> freeway 1: safe? (since unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62]) -> safe.\n\nThen T=50: we are at freeway 1. But we cannot go up to freeway 2 at T=51? Because if we do U at T=50, then at T=51 we are at freeway 2 -> but freeway 2 is unsafe at T=51? (because unsafe at [51,53]) -> unsafe.\n\nSo if we are at freeway 1 at T=50, and we do U at T=50, then at T=51 we are at freeway 2 -> unsafe.\n\nBut we could do S at T=50: then we stay at freeway 1 at T=51? Then at T=51, we are at freeway 1: unsafe? (freeway 1 unsafe at T=51) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway 1 at T=50? Because then at T=50 we are safe (freeway 1 is safe at T=50), but then at T=51 we have to move: if we go up, we go to freeway 2 at T=51 which is unsafe; if we stay, we are at freeway 1 at T=51 which is unsafe; if we go down, we go to freeway 0 at T=51 -> safe? But then we are going backwards.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nAt T=48: U -> T=49: y=1 (safe)\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2 (safe) -> as above, freeway2 safe at T=50.\nThen at T=50: we are at y=2. We have options: \n  U: then T=51: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe? freeway3 unsafe at T=51? No, freeway3 unsafe at [52,53] -> so T=51 is safe? Then we can go to 3 at T=51.\n  D: then T=51: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=51 -> unsafe.\n  S: then T=51: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=51 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must go up at T=50.\n\nThen T=51: at freeway3 (safe, since freeway3 unsafe only at 52,53).\n\nThen T=51: we can do U -> T=52: y=4 -> freeway4: unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway4 at T=52.\n\nTherefore, at T=51: we cannot go up. We can do S? Then T=52: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nOr D: then T=52: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we are stuck at T=51: we cannot go up, down, or stay? Then we must have avoided getting to freeway3 at T=51.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust: we cannot be at freeway3 at T=51? Because then at T=52 we are forced to be at freeway 3 or 4 or 2, and all are unsafe at T=52? \n\nBut wait: freeway2 is unsafe at T=52? freeway2: unsafe at [51,53] -> yes, so at T=52, freeway2 is unsafe. Similarly freeway3: unsafe at [52,53] -> unsafe. Freeway4: unsafe at [52,53] -> unsafe.\n\nSo at T=52, freeways 2,3,4 are all unsafe. And freeways 1,5,6,7,8: \nfreeway1: unsafe at [51,53] -> so at T=52: unsafe? \nfreeway5: unsafe only at T=50 -> safe.\nfreeway6: always safe -> safe.\nfreeway7: unsafe at T=50 -> safe at T=52.\nfreeway8: unsafe at T=50 -> safe at T=52.\n\nBut we are at freeway3 at T=51, and then at T=52 we have to be at freeway2,3, or 4? Which are all unsafe? Then we must avoid being at freeway3 at T=51? \n\nTherefore, we must not arrive at freeway3 at T=51.\n\nSo we need to delay.\n\nLet me try a different route: wait at 0 for one turn.\n\nStart: T=48: S -> T=49: y=0 (safe)\nThen T=49: U -> T=50: y=1 (freeway1: safe at T=50? yes) -> safe.\nNow at T=50: we are at freeway1. We cannot stay (because at T=51: freeway1 is unsafe) and we cannot go up (to freeway2 at T=51: unsafe) so we must go down: D -> T=51: y=0 (safe).\n\nThen at T=51: we are at 0. Now we can go up: U -> T=52: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=52? freeway1 unsafe at [51,53] -> so T=52: unsafe? yes. So we cannot go to freeway1 at T=52.\n\nSo we must stay at 0 at T=51? Then T=52: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at T=52: we can go up? Then T=53: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=53? freeway1 unsafe at [51,53] -> T=53 is the last unsafe time? So unsafe.\n\nWe have to wait until T=54? Then at T=52: we do S -> T=53: y=0 -> safe.\nT=53: do U -> T=54: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe only at [51,53] and [60,62] -> so T=54 is safe.\n\nThen we can start moving up.\n\nBut we are at T=54 at y=1. Then we need to go to y=9: that takes 8 more moves? So total turns: from T=48 to T=54: we did 6 turns to get to y=1? Then we need 8 more moves: so at T=54+8 = T=62 we are at y=9? But we have to check the freeways on the way.\n\nBut note: at T=62, if we are at freeway 8? Actually, we are going to move from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves: so at T=55: y=2, T=56:y=3, T=57:y=4, T=58:y=5, T=59:y=6, T=60:y=7, T=61:y=8, T=62:y=9.\n\nNow, we must check the freeways at these times:\n\nT=54: y=1 -> safe? (since freeway1 unsafe only at [51,53] and [60,62] -> T=54 is safe)\nT=55: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62] -> T=55 safe.\nT=56: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at [52,53] -> T=56 safe.\nT=57: y=4 -> freeway4: unsafe at [52,53] -> safe.\nT=58: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at [50] -> safe.\nT=59: y=6 -> freeway6: always safe -> safe.\nT=60: y=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at [50] -> safe? But wait: freeway7 unsafe at T=50 only? Then safe. However, note: freeway7 also has unsafe at T=60? We computed only at T=50? But we computed for freeway7: only at T=50. Similarly, freeway8: only at T=50. But freeway1 and 2 have unsafe at [60,62]. But we are at freeway7 at T=60: so we don't care about freeway1 and 2. And freeway7 is safe at T=60? Yes, because unsafe only at T=50.\n\nSimilarly, T=61: y=8 -> freeway8: safe? (only unsafe at T=50) -> safe.\nT=62: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nNow, what are the actions?\n\nTurn 48: S (since we started at 48 and did S: so we stayed at 0)\nTurn 49: U -> to 1\nBut wait: we did:\nT=48: S -> at T=49: y=0? Then T=49: U -> at T=50: y=1? Then we did D at T=50? But then we went back to 0? Then we waited? Actually, I described an alternative: wait at 0 until T=53? Then at T=53: we do U to go to 1 at T=54.\n\nBut the path I just described that works is:\n\nWait at 0 until T=53? Then:\nT=48: S -> T=49: y=0\nT=49: S -> T=50: y=0\nT=50: S -> T=51: y=0\nT=51: S -> T=52: y=0\nT=52: S -> T=53: y=0\nT=53: U -> T=54: y=1\nThen:\nT=54: U -> T=55: y=2\nT=55: U -> T=56: y=3\nT=56: U -> T=57: y=4\nT=57: U -> T=58: y=5\nT=58: U -> T=59: y=6\nT=59: U -> T=60: y=7\nT=60: U -> T=61: y=8\nT=61: U -> T=62: y=9\n\nBut this takes 14 turns (from T=48 to T=61: we do 14 actions: 48 to 61 inclusive is 14? Actually, from T=48 to T=61: we take actions at 48,49,...,61: that's 14 actions? Then H=14, and we reach at turn 48+14 = 62? Yes.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe can try to avoid waiting so long.\n\nWe must avoid the unsafe times for the freeways we traverse.\n\nWe must not be at freeway1,2 at T in [51,53] and [60,62]; freeway3,4 at [52,53]; freeway5,7,8 at T=50.\n\nWe want to go from 0 to 9.\n\nWe can try to go faster and avoid the unsafe times by waiting at a safe freeway? For example, freeway 6 is always safe. So if we can get to freeway 6 and then wait? But we are minimizing time.\n\nLet me try to get to freeway 6 as fast as possible.\n\nStart: T=48: U -> T=49: y=1 (safe)\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2 (safe) \nBut then at T=50: we are at freeway2. We cannot go to freeway3 at T=51? Because freeway3 is safe at T=51? But freeway3 unsafe at [52,53] -> so at T=51, freeway3 is safe. But if we go to freeway3 at T=51, then at T=52 we must leave because freeway3 is unsafe at T=52. So we can go up to freeway3 at T=51, then at T=51 we must immediately go up to freeway4? But freeway4 is unsafe at T=52? Yes. Or we can go to freeway2 at T=52? But freeway2 unsafe at T=52. Or freeway4? unsafe.\n\nSo we have to leave freeway3 at T=52? But we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway3 at T=51? Then we must be at freeway2 at T=51? But that's unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at T=50 (at freeway2): we do not go up, but we go down? Then T=51: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=51 -> unsafe.\n\nOr we stay at T=50: then T=51: y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway2 at T=50? Because then we are forced to be unsafe at T=51.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway2 at T=50.\n\nSo the earlier path that waited at 0 until T=53 is one option.\n\nBut we can try to be at freeway5 at T=50? But freeway5 is unsafe at T=50 -> we must avoid.\n\nOr freeway6: we can try to get to freeway6 by T=50? How?\n\nFrom 0 at T=48: \nT=48: U -> T=49: y=1\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2 -> but we want to get to y=6? That's 6 steps? We cannot get to 6 in 2 moves.\n\nWe must wait.\n\nAnother idea: go up to freeway5 or 6 and wait there during the unsafe times.\n\nBut freeway5 is unsafe at T=50 -> we cannot be at freeway5 at T=50.\n\nFreeway6 is safe at T=50.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway6 at T=50, then we can wait there during the unsafe times? But we are minimizing time.\n\nCan we get to freeway6 at T=50?\n\nStart: T=48: U -> T=49: y=1\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2 -> we are only at 2, not 6.\n\nWe need 6 moves to get to 6: \nT=48: U -> T=49: y=1\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2\nT=50: U -> T=51: y=3 -> unsafe? freeway3 at T=51: safe? yes, because unsafe at [52,53] -> safe. \nT=51: U -> T=52: y=4 -> unsafe? freeway4 at T=52: unsafe -> not safe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up faster? But we can only do one per turn.\n\nSo the minimal time to get to freeway6 is 6 moves: at T=48: start at 0, then 6 moves: \nT=48: U -> 1 at T=49\nT=49: U -> 2 at T=50\nT=50: U -> 3 at T=51 (safe for freeway3? yes)\nT=51: U -> 4 at T=52 (freeway4: unsafe) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe must avoid freeway4 at T=52.\n\nTherefore, we need to wait at some safe freeway.\n\nBut freeway6 is always safe, so if we can get to freeway6 and then wait, that is safe.\n\nHow to get to freeway6 without going through unsafe states?\n\nWe have to avoid the unsafe times for the freeways we pass.\n\nWe can try:\n\nStart: T=48: U -> T=49: y=1 (safe)\nT=49: U -> T=50: y=2 (safe)\nT=50: U -> T=51: y=3 (safe) [since freeway3 unsafe at 52,53]\nNow at T=51: we are at freeway3. We want to avoid being at freeway4 at T=52. So at T=51, we cannot go up. We can only go down or stay? \nIf we stay: then T=52: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\nIf we go down: T=52: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway3 at T=51.\n\nSo we must delay the arrival at freeway3 until after T=53.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid freeway1 and 2 at T in [51,53].\n\nSo we can wait at freeway0 until after T=53? Then we start moving at T=54? As in the first path.\n\nBut we can try to wait at freeway0 only until T=50? Then:\n\nT=48: S -> T=49: y=0\nT=49: S -> T=50: y=0\nThen T=50: U -> T=51: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=51 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we have to wait until at least T=54 for freeway1? \n\nBut we can go to freeway6 earlier? \n\nWait: freeway1 is unsafe at T=51,52,53. So we can be at freeway1 at T=50? safe. Then we must leave freeway1 by T=51? But from freeway1 at T=50, we can only go to freeway0 or 2. \nIf we go to freeway0: then we are safe at T=51, but then we are back to 0.\nIf we go to freeway2: then at T=51: freeway2 is unsafe.\n\nSo we have to go to freeway0.\n\nThen we are at freeway0 at T=51. Then we can go to freeway1 at T=52? But freeway1 unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at freeway0 until T=54? Then go up.\n\nSo the path I described earlier is the only safe one? And it takes 14 turns.\n\nBut let me check if we can start moving earlier? For example, wait until T=53? Then:\n\nT=48: S (y=0 at T=49)\nT=49: S (y=0 at T=50)\nT=50: S (y=0 at T=51)\nT=51: S (y=0 at T=52)\nT=52: U -> T=53: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at T=53? yes, because [51,53] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait until T=53: then at T=53: we are at 0, and then we do U at T=53: to go to 1 at T=54 -> safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can start moving is at T=53: then we do U at T=53 to get to 1 at T=54.\n\nThen we go up each turn until we get to 9 at T=62.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 48: S\nTurn 49: S\nTurn 50: S\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: S\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\n\nThen at turn 61: we do U and go from 8 to 9 at turn 62.\n\nSo the last action is at turn 61, and then we are at 9 at turn 62.\n\nThe sequence: from turn 48 to turn 61: that's 14 actions? (48,49,...,61: 61-48+1=14)\n\nBut the problem: the sequence is for t from t1 (48) to t1+H-1. So H=14? Then we do actions at 48,49,...,48+13=61.\n\nThen we reach (0,9) at turn 48+14 = 62? Because the last action is at 61, and then we update to 62.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a shorter path? \n\nWe must avoid the unsafe freeways from 50 to 53. The next safe time to start is at T=54? And then we need 8 moves to go from 1 to 9? So total moves: 6 waits (from T=48 to T=53: 6 turns? Actually, from T=48 to T=53: we do 6 actions? \n\nAt T=48: we do the first action (S), then we do 5 more S's? Then 8 U's? \n\nCount:\n\nActions at turns: \n48: S -> state at T=49: y=0\n49: S -> T=50: y=0\n50: S -> T=51: y=0\n51: S -> T=52: y=0\n52: S -> T=53: y=0\n53: U -> T=54: y=1\n54: U -> T=55: y=2\n55: U -> T=56: y=3\n56: U -> T=57: y=4\n57: U -> T=58: y=5\n58: U -> T=59: y=6\n59: U -> T=60: y=7\n60: U -> T=61: y=8\n61: U -> T=62: y=9\n\nSo 14 actions: turns 48 to 61.\n\nTotal turns: 14.\n\nBut can we do with 13? \n\nIf we start moving at T=52? \n\nAt T=52: we are at y=0. Then we do U at T=52: then T=53: y=1 -> unsafe? freeway1 unsafe at T=53 -> unsafe.\n\nAt T=53: we are at 0, then we do U at T=53: to go to 1 at T=54 -> safe.\n\nBut that is the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to go faster by using down? But that would be going back, which would take more time.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut note: in the above path, we never go down. And we only wait at 0.\n\nNow, we have to output the actions:\n\nTurn 48: S\nTurn 49: S\nTurn 50: S\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: S\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\n\nBut let me double-check the collision at T=60: we are at freeway7. We said freeway7 unsafe only at T=50 -> safe. Similarly, freeway8 at T=61: safe.\n\nAnd the earlier freeways: we pass freeway1 at T=54: safe? freeway1 unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62] -> T=54 is safe. Similarly, freeway2 at T=55: safe, freeway3 at T=56: safe, etc.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut is there a way to skip one wait? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\nT=48: U -> T=49: y=1 (safe)\nT=49: S -> T=50: y=1 -> freeway1: safe at T=50? yes.\nBut then at T=50: we are at freeway1. We must leave by T=51? \nWe can go down: T=51: y=0 -> safe.\nThen at T=51: we are at 0. Then we can go up at T=51: to y=1 at T=52 -> freeway1 unsafe at T=52 -> unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively, at T=50: we do U: then T=51: y=2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at T=51).\n\nSo we must go down at T=50? Then to 0 at T=51. Then we are safe at 0 at T=51. Then we wait at 0 for the next safe time? We can go up at T=52? to 1 at T=53: unsafe (freeway1 at T=53). So we have to wait until T=53 to go up? Then same as before: we do U at T=53 to get to 1 at T=54.\n\nBut then the moves:\n\nT=48: U -> T=49: y=1\nT=49: S -> T=50: y=1\nT=50: D -> T=51: y=0\nT=51: S -> T=52: y=0\nT=52: S -> T=53: y=0\nT=53: U -> T=54: y=1\n... same as before? But we have done 6 moves to get to T=54 at y=1? Same as before: 6 moves? Actually, we did 6 actions: 48 to 53? Then 8 more: 54 to 61? Total 14.\n\nBut we started with U at T=48, so we were at 1 at T=49, then we went back to 0 at T=51. So we wasted moves.\n\nTherefore, the first path (all S until T=53) is simpler and same length.\n\nSo the minimal H is 14.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: S\nTurn 49: S\nTurn 50: S\nTurn 51: S\nTurn 52: S\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn 61: we do U to go from 8 to 9.\n\nAnd we have 14 lines.\n\nWe can verify the positions:\n\nT=48: start at (0,0) -> safe (y=0)\nAfter action S: T=49: (0,0) -> safe\nAfter S: T=50: (0,0) -> safe\nAfter S: T=51: (0,0) -> safe\nAfter S: T=52: (0,0) -> safe\nAfter S: T=53: (0,0) -> safe\nAfter U: T=54: (0,1) -> freeway1: at T=54: safe? freeway1 unsafe at [51,53] and [60,62] -> safe.\nAfter U: T=55: (0,2) -> freeway2: safe at T=55? yes.\nAfter U: T=56: (0,3) -> freeway3: safe at T=56? (unsafe at [52,53]) -> safe.\nAfter U: T=57: (0,4) -> freeway4: safe at T=57? (unsafe at [52,53]) -> safe.\nAfter U: T=58: (0,5) -> freeway5: safe at T=58? (unsafe only at 50) -> safe.\nAfter U: T=59: (0,6) -> freeway6: always safe -> safe.\nAfter U: T=60: (0,7) -> freeway7: safe at T=60? (unsafe at 50) -> safe.\nAfter U: T=61: (0,8) -> freeway8: safe at T=61? (unsafe at 50) -> safe.\nAfter U: T=62: (0,9) -> goal.\n\nAnd we never collide.\n\nSo this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) until turn 53 (relative to \\(t_1\\)) to bypass unsafe time intervals for the freeways. Specifically:\n\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe at turns 51-53 and 60-62.\n- Freeways 3 and 4 are unsafe at turns 52-53.\n- Freeways 5, 7, and 8 are unsafe at turn 50.\n- Freeway 6 is always safe.\n\nThe player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for the first 5 turns (turns 48 to 52) to avoid unsafe freeways. Starting at turn 53, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) consecutively for 8 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 62. The actions are as follows:\n\n- Turns 48 to 52: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding collisions since \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n- Turns 53 to 61: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to incrementally advance from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\), ensuring no collision as all freeways encountered are safe at these times.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ U}\n}",
