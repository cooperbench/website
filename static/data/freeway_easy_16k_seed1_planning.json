The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 to 8. For each freeway, we have a list of cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n- For left-moving cars (d='left'), the car moves to the left. The span at time t is [h - s*(t-t1), τ - s*(t-t1)].\n  But note: the problem states that for left-moving, initially the span is [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n  However, note that in the example for left-moving, they write: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. \n  But observe: if the car is moving left, then the entire car is shifting left. So if initially h > τ (since head is the front and tail is the back, and the car is moving left, then the head is at the rightmost and tail at the leftmost? Actually, the problem defines:\n  - Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning from h to τ? But then note: the update for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that at time T, the car's head (which was at h) is now at h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was at τ) is at τ - s*(T-t1). Since the car is moving left, the head should be the rightmost? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of head and tail. However, the update rule is symmetric.\n\n  Important: The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\n  Also note: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T. So the x-coordinate of the player is always 0. Therefore, we are concerned with whether the car at freeway y_T covers x=0 at turn T.\n\n  How to interpret the car's span? The span is a contiguous interval. For a left-moving car, the entire car moves left at speed s per turn. Similarly, for right-moving, it moves right.\n\n  In the given data, we have:\n    Freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> right-moving: so initially the car is from -95 to -48? But wait, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". But then in the table we have (head, tail) and then direction. \n\n  Let me re-read: \n    - Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n    - Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  So the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h] meaning the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [h, τ] meaning head is the leftmost and tail is the rightmost? \n\n  However, the problem does not explicitly say which is the front. But the update rules are:\n\n    Right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> the entire car moves right, so the tail (which was at τ) becomes τ + s*(T-t1) and the head (which was at h) becomes h + s*(T-t1). This implies that the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? Actually, if the car moves right, then the head (front) should be at the right. So the initial span is [τ, h] meaning from τ (left) to h (right). Then after moving, it shifts to the right.\n\n  Similarly, left-moving: [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]: so if h is the leftmost and τ the rightmost? But then when moving left, the entire car shifts left. But wait: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be at the left? So the initial span is [h, τ] meaning from h (leftmost) to τ (rightmost). Then when moving left, both endpoints decrease.\n\n  However, note the example for freeway 5: \n      (-48, -59, right, 6) -> for right-moving: initial span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at time T, it becomes [-59 + 6*(T), -48 + 6*(T)].\n\n  But wait: the table says (head, tail) = (-48, -59). So head = -48, tail = -59. Then for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. So the car is from -59 to -48.\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: freeway 7: (48,71,left,24) -> initial span [h, τ] = [48,71]? But that would be from 48 to 71. Then moving left: [48-24*(T), 71-24*(T)].\n\n  However, note: 48 to 71 is a segment that is 24 units long? Actually, 71-48 = 23. So the length is 24? Actually 71-48+1 = 24? But we don't need the exact length, we just need the interval.\n\n  The key: at time T, the car on freeway k will cause a collision if the player is on freeway k at turn T and 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\n  We are to plan a sequence of actions from turn t1=0 until the player reaches y=9.\n\n  Important note: the player is only on a freeway at the exact turn when they are on that row. And note the note: if at turn T the player moves to a different row (say from row A to row B at turn T), then at turn T the player is on row A. At turn T, the player is not yet on row B. So when the player moves from row k to row k+1 at turn T, then at turn T the player is on row k (and we check cars on row k at turn T) and then at turn T+1 the player is on row k+1 (and we check cars on row k+1 at turn T+1).\n\n  The goal: we must end at (0,9) at the last turn. So the last action must bring the player to y=9. And we must not collide at any turn.\n\n  We are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\n  Approach:\n  We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the state must also account for the time. However, note that the cars move deterministically and the time is global. We are starting at turn 0. The state can be (t, y) meaning at the beginning of turn t (after having taken the previous action) the player is at y. Then we choose an action for turn t, which leads to y_{t+1} = y + Δy (clamped to [0,9]). And then we check at the next state (t+1, y_{t+1}) we must not collide at turn t+1? Actually, note:\n\n  - At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t. This action will update the position to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t (and clamped). Then at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1]). And at that moment, we check for collision: we are on freeway y_{t+1} at turn t+1? Actually, the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\n  But note: at the very first turn (turn t1=0), we start at (0,0). Then we are about to take an action at turn 0. The problem says: \"determine the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So the first action is at t1 (which is 0). Then after taking the action at turn 0, we are at turn 1 and at position (0, y1). Then we check collision at turn 1? \n\n  Actually, the problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\n  So at turn T, if we are at position (0, y_T), then we check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\n  Therefore, at the start (turn 0) we are at (0,0). Then we take an action a0. Then at turn 1, we are at (0, y1) and we check collision on freeway y1 at time 1.\n\n  However, note that the initial state is given at turn t1=0. The problem does not say we check collision at turn 0? The note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T (here T=0) we are at y0=0. Then we are about to take an action. After the action, we will be at y1 at turn 1. So we do not check at turn 0? The problem does not specify an initial collision check. We assume that the starting position is safe.\n\n  Therefore, we have to avoid collisions at turns 1, 2, ... until the last turn.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  We start at turn 0 at y=0. Then we take an action at turn 0, which leads to y1 at turn 1. Then we must check at turn 1: if y1 is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at time 1. If y1=0 or y1=9, then there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8) so safe.\n\n  Similarly, at turn 2, we are at y2, and if y2 is between 1 and 8, check the cars at time 2.\n\n  We want to reach y=9. When we reach y=9, we stop. But note: we must be at y=9 at the last turn. And we don't check collision for y=9 because there are no cars.\n\n  However, what if we pass through y=9 earlier? The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". We stop as soon as we are at (0,9). So if we get to y=9 at turn H, then we stop and we don't take any further actions.\n\n  The sequence of actions: from turn 0 to turn H-1, and then at turn H we are at (0,9). The minimal H.\n\n  Since we want minimal H, we can do BFS in terms of the number of turns. The state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (meaning we have taken t actions and we are at the beginning of turn t? Actually, let's define:\n\n    Let t be the number of actions taken so far. At step t (i.e., after t actions), we are at turn t (the next turn to take is the t-th action? Actually, we start at turn 0 (state at turn 0). Then we take an action at turn 0, which leads to state at turn 1. Then we take an action at turn 1, leads to state at turn 2, etc.\n\n  We are to find the minimal H such that at turn H we are at y=9. The actions are taken at turns 0,1,...,H-1.\n\n  We can model the state as (time, y) where time is the current turn index (the next action we take is for this turn). But note: the collision check at time t is done when we are at that state? Actually, the collision check at time t is done at the state that we are in at the beginning of turn t? \n\n  Actually, we start at time 0 at (0,0). Then we take action a0, which moves us to (0, y1) at time 1. Then at time 1, we check collision on freeway y1. Then we take action a1, which moves us to (0,y2) at time 2, and then check at time 2, etc.\n\n  So the state at time t (t>=1) is (y_t) and we have taken t actions. We want to reach a state at time H (with H actions taken) such that y_H = 9.\n\n  We start at time 0: we haven't taken any action, and we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at time 0, which leads to time 1 at y1.\n\n  Therefore, we can do BFS starting from (y0=0, time0=0) and then we consider the next state (y1, time1=1) and so on.\n\n  The state: (t, y) meaning at time t (after t actions, so we are at the state that is the result of the t-th action) we are at y. Then we check collision at time t? But note:\n\n      - At time 0: we are at (0,0) and we are about to take the first action. Then we don't check at time 0 because we haven't moved and there are no cars at y=0? Actually, the problem says cars are on freeways 1..8. So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\n      - The collision check happens at the state (t, y) only if y is between 1 and 8. And the check uses the cars at time t.\n\n  However, note: at time 0 we are at y=0, which is safe. Then we take an action and arrive at (0,y1) at time 1. Then at time 1, we check if y1 is in [1,8] and if so, check the cars on that freeway at time 1.\n\n  So the state (t, y) at time t (with t>=1) must be safe: if y is between 1 and 8, then we must ensure that at time t, no car on freeway y has a span that includes 0.\n\n  We are to minimize H (the total number of actions) such that at time H we are at y=9.\n\n  Since we want the minimal H, we can use BFS (by the time t) and we consider the actions U, D, S.\n\n  Constraints on y: must be in [0,9]. If we try to go down from 0, we stay at 0. Similarly, if we go up from 9, we stay at 9.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to go above 9? The problem says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then clamped to [0,9]. So if at 9 and we go up, we stay at 9.\n\n  We are to output the sequence of actions for turns 0,1,...,H-1.\n\n  How many turns might we need? The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars, so it might be more.\n\n  We'll do BFS:\n\n      Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions to be at (t,y) (if we can get there without collision). We are starting at (0,0) with 0 actions (so time0=0, we are at y0=0, and we haven't taken any action). Then we are going to take actions.\n\n      Actually, we are going to simulate:\n\n          states: (t, y) meaning that at time t (so we have taken t actions) we are at y.\n\n          We start: (0,0) -> no collision check at time0? We consider this as the starting state.\n\n          Then we take an action (U, D, or S) to go to state (t+1, y') where:\n\n              if action is U: y' = min(9, y+1)\n              if action is D: y' = max(0, y-1)\n              if action is S: y' = y\n\n          Then at the new state (t+1, y') we must check for collision:\n\n              if y' is 0 or 9: safe.\n              if y' is in {1,2,...,8}: then check all cars on freeway y' at time t+1.\n\n          How to check a car at time T (here T = t+1) on freeway k?\n\n          For each car on freeway k:\n\n            if the car is right-moving: (τ, h, direction, s) -> but note the input is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the initial span at time0 is [τ, h] = [tail, head]. Then at time T, the span becomes [τ + s*T, h + s*T].\n\n            if the car is left-moving: [h, τ] at time0, then at time T: [h - s*T, τ - s*T].\n\n          Then we check if 0 is in the interval [low, high] (inclusive) for that car.\n\n          Important: the span is inclusive? The problem does not specify, but we assume inclusive.\n\n          Example: freeway 5 at time0: \n            car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> for right-moving: initial span = [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Then at time T: [-59+6*T, -48+6*T]. \n            We need to check if 0 is in [-59+6T, -48+6T] for some T.\n\n          Similarly, freeway 6: \n            car: (0, -11, right, 4) -> initial span = [-11,0] at time0? Then at time T: [-11+4T, 0+4T] = [4T-11, 4T]. \n            So at time T, if 0 is in [4T-11, 4T]? \n                For T=0: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? But at time0, the car is on freeway6? And at time0, we are at (0,0) and we haven't moved? But we don't check freeway6 at time0 because we are at y0=0? Then at time1, we might be at freeway6? Then at time1, the car on freeway6: [4*1-11, 4*1] = [-7,4]. 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes. So if we are on freeway6 at time1, we collide.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be on freeway6 at time1.\n\n  We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each time t (from 1 up to a limit) whether there is any car on freeway k that covers 0 at time t.\n\n  How to precompute? For each car, we can compute the time interval during which 0 is in its moving span.\n\n  For a right-moving car: (τ, h, s) -> span at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]. We need τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\n      => t >= ceil(( - h) / s) ??? Actually:\n\n        τ + s*t <= 0  => t >= ceil(( - τ) / s) ? \n        and 0 <= h + s*t => t >= ceil(( - h) / s) ??? Actually, let me write:\n\n        τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\n        => \n          s*t >= -h   -> t >= ceil(-h/s)   [if s>0, then we can divide: t >= ceil(-h/s) but note: if h is negative, then -h is positive]\n          and s*t >= -τ -> t >= ceil(-τ/s) \n\n        But note: because the car is moving right and τ <= h (since the initial span is [τ, h] and τ is the left end, h the right end) then we have:\n\n          The condition is: \n             τ + s*t <= 0   -> t <= (-τ)/s   [if we solve for t as real?] Actually, we have:\n\n          Lower bound: t >= ceil( (-h) / s )? \n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n\n          τ + s*t <= 0   -> t <= ( - τ ) / s   [if we solve for t such that the left end is <=0] \n          and \n          h + s*t >= 0   -> t >= ceil( (-h) / s )   if we are solving for integers? \n\n        But note: we are at integer times. \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          The car covers 0 at time t if and only if:\n            0 is in the interval [τ + s*t, h + s*t] (inclusive).\n\n          So:\n            τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\n          => \n            t >= ceil( (-h) / s )   and   t <= floor( (-τ) / s )   ??? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n          τ + s*t <= 0  => t <= ( - τ ) / s   (if s>0, then we can divide: t <= (-τ)/s) \n          and \n          h + s*t >= 0  => t >= ceil( (-h) / s )   [because if (-h)/s is not integer, then we need to round up]\n\n        But note: if τ and h are integers and s is integer, then:\n\n          The condition is:\n            t_min = ceil( (-h) / s )   and t_max = floor( (-τ) / s )\n\n          And then t must be an integer in [t_min, t_max].\n\n        However, let me test with the freeway6 car: (head, tail) = (0, -11), s=4, right-moving.\n\n          Then: \n            τ = tail = -11, h = head = 0.\n\n          Condition: \n            τ + s*t = -11 + 4t <= 0  -> 4t <= 11 -> t <= 11/4 = 2.75 -> so t <= 2 (since t integer) -> t_max = 2.\n            h + s*t = 0 + 4t >= 0 -> always true for t>=0? Actually, we require 0<=0+4t -> 0<=4t -> t>=0.\n\n          Therefore, the car covers 0 at t=0,1,2.\n\n        But wait: at t=0: the car is at [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n        t=1: [-11+4, 0+4] = [-7,4] -> 0 included? yes.\n        t=2: [-11+8, 0+8] = [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes.\n        t=3: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So the condition is: t_min = ceil( (-h)/s ) = ceil(0/4)=ceil(0)=0, and t_max = floor( (-τ)/s ) = floor(11/4)=floor(2.75)=2.\n\n        Therefore, for a right-moving car: \n            t_min = ceil( ( - head ) / s )   -> but note: head is h, so -h/s.\n            t_max = floor( ( - tail ) / s )   -> because τ = tail.\n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car: \n            The car is (head, tail, 'left', s). The span at time t: [head - s*t, tail - s*t].\n            Condition: head - s*t <= 0 <= tail - s*t.\n\n            => \n                head - s*t <= 0  => -s*t <= -head  => t >= ceil(head/s)   [because we divide by -s (negative) so inequality flips? But note: we are subtracting so: head <= s*t -> t>=ceil(head/s)]\n                and \n                tail - s*t >= 0  => tail >= s*t  => t <= floor(tail/s)\n\n            Example: freeway7: (48,71,left,24) -> \n                head=48, tail=71, s=24.\n                Condition: t>= ceil(48/24)=ceil(2)=2, and t<=floor(71/24)=floor(2.95)=2.\n                So only at t=2: \n                    at t=2: [48-48, 71-48] = [0,23] -> 0 is included.\n\n            But wait: at t=0: [48,71] -> 0 not included? no. \n            t=1: [48-24,71-24]=[24,47] -> no.\n            t=2: [0,23] -> includes 0? yes.\n\n        However, note: the example freeway7: (48,71,left,24) -> we computed t_min=ceil(48/24)=2, t_max=floor(71/24)=2, so only t=2.\n\n        But what about t=3? \n            [48-72, 71-72] = [-24, -1] -> no.\n\n        Therefore, for a left-moving car:\n            t_min = ceil(head/s)\n            t_max = floor(tail/s)\n\n        However, note: we must check the inequalities:\n\n            head - s*t <= 0   => t >= ceil(head/s)   (if head/s is not integer, then ceil is the smallest integer t such that s*t>=head)\n            tail - s*t >= 0   => t <= floor(tail/s)\n\n        But note: the condition also requires that head<=tail? In the example, head=48, tail=71 -> yes.\n\n        However, what if the car is defined with head>tail? The problem says for left-moving: initial span [h,τ] and then [h-s*t, τ-s*t]. So if h>τ, then the initial span is from h to τ? But then the condition for covering 0 would be:\n\n            min(h-s*t, τ-s*t) <= 0 <= max(h-s*t, τ-s*t)\n\n        But in the example, the car is defined as (48,71) and then [48,71] meaning from 48 to 71? So we assume that in the input for left-moving, head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the initial span is [h,τ] and then moves left. So if h=48 and τ=71, then the car is from 48 to 71? But then when moving left, the entire segment moves left. So the condition is:\n\n            The interval at time t is [h-s*t, τ-s*t] and we assume h<=τ? \n\n        But in the input, for left-moving we have (48,71): so h=48, τ=71 -> and 48<=71. \n\n        Similarly, for right-moving: (head, tail) = (-48,-95) -> head=-48, tail=-95 -> so head>tail? But the initial span for right-moving is [τ, h] = [-95, -48] -> so tail=-95, head=-48 -> tail<=head.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume:\n\n          For any car, the initial span is given such that the left endpoint is the first number and the right endpoint is the second? Actually:\n\n            For right-moving: the initial span is [tail, head] and we have tail<=head? Because the car is from tail to head (left to right).\n\n            For left-moving: the initial span is [head, tail] and we have head<=tail? Because the car is from head to tail (left to right) and then moves left.\n\n        But in the input:\n\n          Freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> head=-48, tail=-95 -> then tail=-95, head=-48 -> tail<=head? -95<=-48 -> true.\n\n          Freeway 7: (48,71,left,24) -> head=48, tail=71 -> head<=tail -> true.\n\n        So we can proceed.\n\n  Precomputation:\n\n    Let danger[k][t] = true if at time t, freeway k (for k in 1..8) has a car that covers 0.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      For each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n        For each car on freeway k:\n          if the car is right-moving:\n            tail = given tail (second element in the tuple) -> but note: the input for the car is (head, tail, ...). So we have:\n                head = h, tail = τ (as per input)\n            Then the initial span is [τ, h] (with τ<=h). Then at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t].\n            Condition: τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\n            => \n                t_min = ceil( ( - h ) / s )   [if we solve: h+s*t>=0 -> t>= ceil(-h/s) ? But note: if h is negative, then -h is positive, so t>= ceil(-h/s).]\n                t_max = floor( ( - τ ) / s )   [because τ+s*t<=0 -> t<= floor(-τ/s)]\n\n            However, note: if τ+s*t <=0 and h+s*t>=0, then we require:\n                t >= max( ceil(-h/s), ... ) but actually the condition is:\n\n                We require: \n                  τ + s*t <= 0   -> t <= (-τ)/s   -> so t_max = floor( (-τ) / s )   (because t must be integer and (-τ)/s might not be integer, so we take floor: the largest integer <= (-τ)/s)\n                  and \n                  h + s*t >= 0   -> t >= ceil( (-h) / s )   (because (-h)/s might not be integer, so we round up to the smallest integer t such that t>= (-h)/s)\n\n            But note: if (-h)/s is not an integer, then we need to round up.\n\n          Similarly, for left-moving:\n            head = h, tail = τ, and we assume h<=τ.\n            Condition: h - s*t <= 0 <= τ - s*t.\n            => \n                h - s*t <= 0 -> t >= ceil(h/s)\n                τ - s*t >= 0 -> t <= floor(τ/s)\n\n        Then the car covers 0 for all integer t in [t_min, t_max] (if t_min<=t_max).\n\n      Then for a freeway k, at time t, if any car on freeway k has t_min <= t <= t_max, then danger[k][t] = true.\n\n    We'll compute for t from 1 to a sufficiently large value (say up to 20, because minimal H is at least 9, and we might have to wait a few steps).\n\n  After precomputation, we run BFS:\n\n      Let's define a state (t, y) meaning that at time t (so we have taken t actions, and we are at the state that is the result of the last action) we are at y.\n\n      We start: (0,0) is safe? We don't check at time0? Actually, we are at y=0 at time0 -> safe.\n\n      We want to reach (H,9) for the smallest H.\n\n      From state (t, y), we try actions U, D, S:\n\n          next_y = \n            U: min(9, y+1)\n            D: max(0, y-1)\n            S: y\n\n          Then next state: (t+1, next_y)\n\n          Then we check: if next_y is in [1,8] then we check danger[k=next_y][t+1] (which we precomputed). If danger[k][t+1] is true, then skip (collision). Otherwise, safe.\n\n          If next_y is 0 or 9: safe.\n\n      We use a queue: we start from (0,0) and then we try all actions.\n\n      We keep a visited array: visited[t][y] to avoid revisiting the same state with a higher or equal time? Actually, if we can get to (t,y) with a lower time we don't need to consider a higher time. But note: we are minimizing the total time H. So if we have reached (t,y) we don't need to visit it again with the same or higher t? Actually, if we are at (t,y) and we have a path that took t steps to get to y, then any other path that takes more steps to get to the same (t,y) is not better. However, note that we are not storing the time as the total steps but as the current time index. And we are doing BFS by time, so the first time we reach (y, t) we have the minimal steps.\n\n      But note: we might have cycles? We might go down and then up? But since we are minimizing time, we don't want to go back to the same (y, t) with a higher time? Actually, we are doing BFS by time (each edge increases time by 1). So we can mark visited for (t,y) and if we have seen (t,y) then we skip.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Let dist[t][y] = minimal time? Actually, we don't need dist, we just want the sequence. We can store the parent: from which state and which action we came.\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            queue: (t, y, path)   but path might be long? Alternatively, we store parent pointers.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store:\n\n            Let prev[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action) that led to (t,y).\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Initialize: \n                time0: (0,0): set visited[0][0]=true, and prev[0][0] = null.\n\n            Then for each time t from 0 to ... until we find y=9:\n\n                For each y in 0..9:\n\n                  if state (t,y) is visited, then for each action in [U,D,S]:\n\n                    next_y = as above.\n\n                    next_t = t+1.\n\n                    if next_y is in [1,8] and danger[next_y][next_t] is true, skip.\n\n                    else if next_y is 0 or 9: safe.\n\n                    Then if we haven't visited (next_t, next_y), mark it and set parent.\n\n                    If next_y==9, then we found a solution: H = next_t.\n\n            Then we backtrack: from (H,9) we can get the actions: the action taken at time H-1 is stored when we went from (H-1, y_prev) to (H,9). Actually, note:\n\n                We are at (t,y) and we take an action to get to (t+1, next_y).\n\n                So the action at time t is stored.\n\n            We want the sequence for turn0, turn1, ... turn H-1.\n\n            The action at time t (which is the t-th action) is stored in the edge from (t,y) to (t+1, next_y).\n\n          Therefore, we can store:\n\n            parent[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action_prev)   meaning that we came from (t_prev, y_prev) by taking action_prev to get to (t,y). But note: at time t_prev we are at y_prev, and then we take action_prev to get to y at time t_prev+1. So t = t_prev+1.\n\n          Actually, we can store:\n\n            Let from[t][y] = the state (t_prev, y_prev) and the action taken at time t_prev.\n\n          But note: we are at time t, and we came from time t-1.\n\n          We'll create:\n\n            prev_action[t][y] = the action taken at time (t-1) to get to (t,y).\n\n            and prev_y[t][y] = the previous y (at time t-1).\n\n          Then we can backtrack from (H,9): \n              for t from H down to 1: \n                  action_{t-1} = prev_action[t][y_t]\n                  then the previous state is (t-1, y_{t-1}) = (t-1, prev_y[t][y_t])\n\n          Then the sequence: \n              turn0: action0 = prev_action[1][y1]   ... but note: the action at turn0 is stored at the state at time1.\n\n          Specifically:\n\n            We start at time0: (0,0) -> we don't store an action for time0 in the state at time0.\n\n            Then we take an action at time0 to get to (1,y1). So the state at time1: y1 was reached by an action at time0.\n\n            Similarly, the state at time2: reached by an action at time1.\n\n          Therefore, for the state (t,y) (with t>=1), we store:\n\n            prev[t][y] = (prev_y, action)   meaning that at time t-1 we were at prev_y, and we took the action to get to y at time t.\n\n          Then to get the entire sequence from time0 to time H-1 (for the last state at time H, we don't take an action at time H, so we have taken H actions and we are at (H,9)):\n\n            We start at the state (H,9). \n            Then we backtrack:\n\n                Let t = H, y = 9.\n                We will build the sequence backwards.\n\n                For step i from H-1 down to 0:\n                    action_i = the action that was taken to get to the current state at time t.\n                    then the previous state is (t-1, prev_y) -> so we set y = prev_y, t = t-1.\n\n          Then we reverse the sequence of actions to get from turn0 to turn H-1.\n\n  Precomputation for danger: we'll set a limit for t. Since the minimal H is at least 9, and we might have to wait a few steps, let's set t_max to 20.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on k, the time interval [t_min, t_max] for which the car covers 0. Then for each time t from 1 to 20, set danger[k][t] = true if any car on freeway k covers 0 at time t.\n\n    Then run BFS:\n\n        Initialize: \n            visited = 2D array [0..20] x [0..9] (boolean) -> false.\n            We'll create arrays: \n                prev_action[t][y] = None   for t in [1..20] and y in [0..9]\n                prev_y[t][y] = None\n\n        Start: (0,0) -> visited[0][0]=true.\n\n        Queue: collections.deque([(0,0)])   # (time, y)\n\n        while queue:\n            pop state (t, y)\n\n            if y==9: then we found a solution? But note: we are at time t and we are at y=9. Then we can stop? But we are at time t, and we have taken t actions. So H = t? However, note: we started at time0 (0 actions taken) and we are now at time t (after t actions). We are at (0,9) at time t? Then we have reached the goal at time t. So H = t.\n\n            But note: we don't check the state (0,0) at time0 for goal? The goal is to be at y=9 at any time. So we can break.\n\n            However, we want the minimal t. Since we are doing BFS, the first time we get to y=9 is the minimal.\n\n            Then backtrack the actions.\n\n            Else, we consider next states for time t+1:\n\n                for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                    next_y = \n                        U: min(9, y+1)\n                        D: max(0, y-1)\n                        S: y\n\n                    next_t = t+1\n\n                    If next_t > 20: skip? But we set a limit.\n\n                    If next_y is in [1,8]:\n                        if danger[k=next_y][next_t] is true -> skip (collision)\n                    else: safe.\n\n                    If not visited[next_t][next_y]:\n                        visited[next_t][next_y] = true\n                        prev_action[next_t][next_y] = action\n                        prev_y[next_t][next_y] = y\n                        push (next_t, next_y) to queue.\n\n        If we break at (t,9), then we backtrack:\n\n            actions = []\n            curr_t = t\n            curr_y = 9\n            while curr_t > 0:\n                a = prev_action[curr_t][curr_y]\n                actions.append(a)\n                curr_y = prev_y[curr_t][curr_y]\n                curr_t -= 1\n\n            Then we have the actions in reverse order: from the last action (at time t-1) to the first (at time0). So we reverse.\n\n        Then we output:\n\n            Turn 0: action0\n            Turn 1: action1\n            ...\n            Turn t-1: action_{t-1}\n\n        Note: we have taken t actions (from time0 to time t-1) to get to time t at y=9.\n\n        But note: the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and then at the last turn (after H actions) we are at (0,9). So H = t (the time we reached) and the actions are for turns 0 to t-1? \n\n        However, note: we started at time0 (turn0) and then we take an action at turn0 to get to time1. Then ... at turn t-1 we take an action to get to time t (at which we are at 9). So the number of actions is t, and the last action is at turn t-1.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 0: a0\n            Turn 1: a1\n            ...\n            Turn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\n        And H = t.\n\n  Let's test with the freeway6 car at time1: \n        freeway6: \n          car1: (48,37,right,4) -> wait, the input says: \n            Freeway 6: (48,37,right,4) -> but wait: head=48, tail=37? \n            But for right-moving, we have [τ, h] = [37,48]? Then at time t: [37+4t, 48+4t]. \n            Condition: 37+4t <=0<=48+4t -> \n                37+4t<=0 -> 4t<=-37 -> t<= -37/4 -> negative? so never.\n            car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> as above: covers t=0,1,2.\n\n        So at time1: freeway6: danger[6][1] = true (because of car2).\n\n        Therefore, if we try to go to freeway6 at time1, we collide.\n\n  Now, let's try to compute a path.\n\n  We start at (0,0). Then at time0 we can take:\n\n      U: next_y = 1 -> then at time1, we are at freeway1. Check freeway1 at time1:\n\n          freeway1: car: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> \n            right-moving: tail=-95, head=-48.\n            Condition: \n                t_min = ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil(48/48)=ceil(1)=1\n                t_max = floor( (-tail)/s ) = floor(95/48)=floor(1.97)=1\n            So only at time1: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> 0 is included? yes -> danger[1][1]=true -> collision.\n\n      D: next_y=0 -> safe, but we are still at 0. Then we can try again? But we don't want to wait if we can avoid.\n\n      S: next_y=0 -> same as D.\n\n  So we cannot go up at time0? Then try D or S: we stay at 0 at time1.\n\n      Then at time1: we are at (0,0). Then we take action at time1:\n\n          U: to freeway1 at time2: \n                freeway1 at time2: \n                  car: [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n          So we can go to freeway1 at time2.\n\n  Then from (1,0) at time1, we take U: to (2,1) -> safe.\n\n  Then from (2,1) we can go U to (3,2): \n        freeway2 at time3: \n          car: (-48,-95,right,48) -> at time3: [-95+48*3, -48+48*3] = [ -95+144, -48+144 ] = [49,96] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n  Then from (3,2) we go U to (4,3): \n        freeway3: car (-48,-59,right,4) -> \n            tail=-59, head=-48 -> right-moving: \n                at time4: [-59+4*4, -48+4*4] = [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43,-32] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n  Then from (4,3) to (5,4): \n        freeway4: car (-48,-59,right,4) -> \n            at time5: [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n  Then from (5,4) to (6,5): \n        freeway5: three cars? \n            car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at time6: [-59+6*6, -48+6*6] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n            car2: (-12,-23,right,6) -> at time6: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n            car3: (24,13,right,6) -> wait: head=24, tail=13 -> then for right-moving: [13,24] at time0?

Because above I said at time0 we took S, then at time1 we were at 0. Then at time1 we took U to go to 1 at time2. But then at time2 we are at freeway1, which we checked was safe.\n\n  But wait, in the BFS we must consider all possibilities. The above path is one possibility. However, we might find a shorter path.\n\n  Actually, the minimal H is at least 9? But in this path we have 10. Can we do 9?\n\n      We start at 0. Then we take 9 consecutive U: \n          time1: y=1 -> freeway1: at time1: car1: [ -95+48, -48+48 ] = [-47,0] -> 0 included -> collision.\n\n      Then we must avoid freeway1 at time1.

Then we need a 10th action to get to 9.\n\n      So minimal H is 10.\n\n  However, can we avoid the initial wait? \n\n      What if we start with D? Then we go to -1? But no: we clamp to 0. So same as S.\n\n      So we must wait at time0.\n\n  Another possibility: can we go down at time0? Then we are at 0 at time1 (same as S). Then same as above.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n  But note: we might take a detour? For example, at some point we go down to avoid a car? But we are going up as fast as possible, and we avoided the collision by waiting only at the beginning.\n\n  We'll run the BFS to confirm.\n\n  Precomputation for danger: for t from 1 to 20.\n\n  Freeway1: \n      car: right-moving: tail=-95, head=-48, s=48.\n        t_min = ceil( (48)/48 ) = ceil(1)=1\n        t_max = floor( (95)/48 ) = floor(1.97)=1\n        So danger[1][t] is true only for t=1.\n\n  Freeway2: same as freeway1? \n      car: (-48,-95,right,48) -> same: so danger[2][1]=true.\n\n  Freeway3: \n      car: (-48,-59,right,4) -> \n        t_min = ceil(48/4)=ceil(12)=12\n        t_max = floor(59/4)=floor(14.75)=14\n        So danger[3][t] for t in [12,14] -> so for t=12,13,14.\n\n  Freeway4: same as freeway3: danger[4][t] for t in [12,14].\n\n  Freeway5: three cars:\n\n      car1: (-48,-59,right,6): \n          t_min = ceil(48/6)=ceil(8)=8\n          t_max = floor(59/6)=floor(9.83)=9\n          -> t in [8,9]\n\n      car2: (-12,-23,right,6):\n          t_min = ceil(12/6)=ceil(2)=2\n          t_max = floor(23/6)=floor(3.83)=3\n          -> t in [2,3]\n\n      car3: (24,13,right,6): \n          This car: head=24, tail=13 -> for right-moving: [13,24] at time0.\n          Condition: 13+6t <=0<=24+6t -> \n             13+6t<=0 -> 6t<=-13 -> never? because t>=0 -> so never covers 0.\n\n          So danger[5][t] is true for t in [2,3] (from car2) and [8,9] (from car1).\n\n  Freeway6: two cars:\n\n      car1: (48,37,right,4): \n          Condition: 37+4t<=0<=48+4t -> \n              37+4t<=0 -> t<= -37/4 -> never? so safe.\n\n      car2: (0,-11,right,4): \n          Condition: -11+4t<=0<=0+4t -> \n              -11+4t<=0 -> 4t<=11 -> t<=2.75 -> t=0,1,2\n              0<=4t -> always true for t>=0.\n          So t in [0,2] -> but we are checking for t>=1? \n          So danger[6][1]=true, danger[6][2]=true.\n\n  Freeway7: \n      car: (48,71,left,24):\n          t_min = ceil(48/24)=2\n          t_max = floor(71/24)=2   (since 71/24=2.95 -> floor=2)\n          So danger[7][2]=true.\n\n  Freeway8: same as freeway7: danger[8][2]=true.\n\n  Therefore, danger array:\n\n      t: 1 to 20\n\n      k=1: t=1 -> danger\n      k=2: t=1 -> danger\n      k=3: t=12,13,14 -> danger\n      k=4: t=12,13,14 -> danger\n      k=5: t=2,3,8,9 -> danger\n      k=6: t=1,2 -> danger\n      k=7: t=2 -> danger\n      k=8: t=2 -> danger\n\n  Now we run BFS:\n\n      Start: (0,0) -> visited.\n\n      Then for each action at time0: \n          U: next_y=1 -> time1 -> freeway1: danger[1][1]=true -> skip.\n          D: next_y=0 -> safe -> state (1,0) -> new state.\n          S: next_y=0 -> safe -> state (1,0) -> same as above.\n\n      So we have state (1,0).\n\n      Then from (1,0): \n          U: next_y=1 -> time2 -> freeway1: danger[1][2]? k=1: only t=1 -> safe. -> state (2,1) -> new.\n          D: next_y=0 -> state (2,0) -> new.\n          S: next_y=0 -> state (2,0) -> same.\n\n      Then from (2,1): \n          U: next_y=2 -> time3 -> freeway2: danger[2][3]? k=2: only t=1 -> safe. -> state (3,2) -> new.\n          D: next_y=0 -> state (3,0) -> new.\n          S: next_y=1 -> state (3,1) -> check freeway1: at time3: safe -> new.\n\n      Then from (2,0): \n          ... \n\n      We are looking for the fastest way to 9.\n\n      We'll continue until we hit 9.\n\n      We'll keep expanding until we get to y=9.\n\n      We found a path at time10: (10,9).

Then:\n\n      Turn0: D -> then at time1: we are at 0 (because we clamp) -> same as S.\n\n  So both are valid.\n\n  But the problem asks for minimal H, and we found H=10.\n\n  However, is there a path with H=9? \n\n      We would need to be at y=9 at time9. \n\n      How? \n          We start at time0: y0=0.\n          Then we take 9 actions: we must be at y9=9.\n\n          The minimal moves: we need 9 U moves. But we cannot do 9 consecutive U because at time1 we would be at 1 and collide (freeway1 at time1 is dangerous). \n\n          How about a different route? \n\n          We could go down at some point? But we start at 0 and we can't go below 0. And we are going to 9, so we need to go up overall.\n\n      Let me try:\n\n          turn0: U -> to 1 at time1 -> collide at freeway1? yes.\n\n      So we must avoid being at freeway1 at time1. Therefore, we must not go up at time0. So we must start with S or D.\n\n      Then at time1: we are at 0.\n\n      Then we have 8 more actions to go from 0 to 9? that requires 9 moves? so impossible.\n\n      Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n  So the answer is:\n\n      Turn 0: S   (or D? but S is equivalent and we used S in our BFS)\n      Then 9 U's.\n\n  But note: in the BFS we found we did S at time0 and then U at time1, then 8 U's. But that is 9 U's? Actually:\n\n      S at time0: then 9 U's: that would be 10 actions: \n          time1:0 -> time2:1 -> time3:2 -> ... time10:9.\n\n      So we need 10 actions.\n\n  Therefore, we output 10 actions.\n\n  We can choose either S or D at turn0. We'll choose S.\n\n  Output:\n\n      Turn 0: S\n      Turn 1: U\n      Turn 2: U\n      Turn 3: U\n      Turn 4: U\n      Turn 5: U\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n\n  But wait: in the BFS we did 9 U's from turn1 to turn9? Then we have:\n\n      turn0: S\n      turn1: U\n      turn2: U\n      ...\n      turn9: U\n\n  That is 10 actions.\n\n  However, note: at turn9 we take the last U to get to 9 at time10.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      \\boxed{\n        Turn 0: S\n        Turn 1: U\n        Turn 2: U\n        Turn 3: U\n        Turn 4: U\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n      }\n\n  But let me verify the collision at each step:\n\n      time1: y=0 -> safe.\n      time2: y=1 -> freeway1: danger[1][2]? we computed only danger at time1 -> safe.\n      time3: y=2 -> freeway2: danger[2][3]? only at time1 -> safe.\n      time4: y=3 -> freeway3: danger[3][4]? only at 12,13,14 -> safe.\n      time5: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      time6: y=5 -> freeway5: danger[5][6]? no -> safe.\n      time7: y=6 -> freeway6: danger[6][7]? no -> safe.\n      time8: y=7 -> freeway7: danger[7][8]? only at time2 -> safe.\n      time9: y=8 -> freeway8: danger[8][9]? only at time2 -> safe.\n      time10: y=9 -> safe.\n\n  All safe.\n\n  Therefore, this is a valid solution.\n\n  However, note: we could have taken D at turn0? Then:\n\n      Turn0: D -> then time1: y=0 -> safe.\n      Then same as above.\n\n  But the problem does not specify a preference. We choose S.\n\n  Final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 10, with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 0 (current turn), the player starts at \\((0, 0)\\).

Then at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1} and check the car on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update is:\n  - Action U: y += 1\n  - Action D: y -= 1\n  - Action S: y stays\n\nAnd we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe car update is linear in time. For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n  - For a future turn T (>= t1), the car's position is:\n        if left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        if right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [note: the representation for right is given as (head, tail) but in the update the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]]\n\nBut note: the initial state at turn t1=1 is given.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 1) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nApproach:\nSince the grid is small (only 9 rows: 0 to 9, but we start at 0 and goal at 9, and we have 8 freeways in between) and the cars move at integer speeds and we move one step at a time, we can try to simulate the moves turn by turn.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously (in integer steps) and we must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when a car on freeway y has its span covering 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nWe are starting at (0,0) at turn 1. Our goal is to get to (0,9). We can move up, down, or stay. But we must avoid the freeways at the moment we are on them.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 because:\n  - At the starting position (0,0): no freeway (freeways are from 1 to 8) so safe at turn 1.\n  - At the goal (0,9): also not a freeway? But note: the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways. Therefore, we are safe at the start and the goal.\n\nSo we only need to worry when we are on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to plan a path from row0 to row9, passing through rows 1 to 8 without colliding.\n\nSince the minimal number of moves is at least 9 (if we go straight up without waiting) but we might have to wait because of cars, we might have to take more than 9 turns.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space: (turn, y) and we want to get to any turn with y=9. The state is (t, y) and we have three actions. The state t can go up arbitrarily, but note that the car positions are linear in time and periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed and the road is infinite? But note: the collision condition is only about the car's span including 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the car positions are given as integers? The head and tail are integers, and the speed is integer. So the positions at integer turns are integers.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>= t1) whether the freeway k is occupied at turn T (i.e., if the car on freeway k at turn T has a span that includes 0).\n\nBut note: each freeway has one or more cars? The table lists multiple cars per freeway? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\nFreeway 6: two cars: (52,41,right,4), (4,-7,right,4)\nOthers: one car.\n\nSo for each freeway k and turn T, we must check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe are at turn t1=1.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (>=1) the set of cars that are present and if any car covers 0 at turn T.\n\nBut note: the car update:\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn 1:\n\nAt turn T (>=1):\n\nIf d = 'left':\n   head_T = h - s*(T-1)\n   tail_T = tau - s*(T-1)\n   The span is [head_T, tail_T] (if head_T <= tail_T? but note: the initial state for left-moving is given as (head, tail) and then the update subtracts s*(T-1). However, the initial state for left-moving is given as (h, tau) and the update: [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]. But note: the head and tail might be in any order? Actually, the representation for left-moving: the head is the leading part? The problem states:\n        Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut what if h > tau? Then the span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? Actually, in the update for left-moving, the entire car moves left. Similarly for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] meaning that if originally tau < h, then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo we can represent the span as an interval.\n\nFor a car at freeway k, we are only concerned when the player is at (0, k) at turn T, and we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 1) the set of intervals for each car and check if 0 is covered.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate the player's moves. We can do a BFS in the state space (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 1) and y in [0,9]. We start at (1,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nThe state: (t, y)\n\nActions: U, D, S -> leads to (t+1, y+1), (t+1, y-1), (t+1, y) [but bounded between 0 and 9]\n\nWe cannot go to a state (t, y) if y is between 1 and 8 and at turn t, the freeway y has a car that covers 0.\n\nWe are only concerned when y is between 1 and 8.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no freeway -> safe.\n\nWe start at (1,0): safe.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we are at (t1+H-1, 9). Note: the sequence of actions starts at t1 (turn 1) and we take H actions, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. But note: we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\nWait: the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t and then at turn t+1 we have y_{t+1}. So:\n\nAt turn 1: we are at (0,0). Then we take action a_1 at turn 1, and then at turn 2 we are at y_2 = y_1 + Delta y_1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the state of turn T, that means we took an action at turn T-1 that led to y_T = 9.\n\nTherefore, we are done at the moment we have y_T = 9 at turn T. We do not take an action at turn T if we have already reached.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t1 (which is 1) to t1+H-1. And after H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we start at turn 1 (state: y_1=0). We take H actions: at turn 1, 2, ..., H. Then at turn H+1 we have y_{H+1} = 9.\n\nSo we are looking for the minimal H such that we can get to y_{H+1}=9.\n\nBut note: the state at turn t is y_t. So we want y_{t1+H} = 9, and we take actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are going to simulate states for turns starting at 1 (state0: turn1, y1=0) and then we take an action to get to state at turn2, etc.\n\nWe want to find the minimal H such that after H actions (so at turn 1+H) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can do BFS in the state (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 1) and y in [0,9]. We want to get to (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\nBut note: t can be large? But the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, the cars move continuously and the road is infinite, but the positions of the cars modulo the period of the freeway might be periodic. However, the periods might be large? We can compute the next safe time for each freeway.\n\nBut note: the speeds and initial positions are given, so we can compute for each freeway k the set of turns T for which the freeway k is safe (i.e., 0 is not covered by any car on k at turn T).\n\nWe can precompute the safety for each freeway k for a range of turns. Since we are looking for the minimal H, we can compute until we find a path.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the safety for each freeway k for turns from 1 up to, say, 100 (if minimal path is at most 100 steps) and then do BFS.\n\nMinimal H: at least 9 (if we go straight up: 9 moves from 0 to 9: 0->1->2->...->9, which takes 9 actions? Let's see:\n\nAt turn1: y1=0.\nAfter 1st action (turn1): we go to y2 = 0+1 = 1? But then at turn2 we are at y2=1. Then after 2nd action: turn2: we go to y3=2, ... after 9th action (at turn9) we get to y10=9. So we need 9 actions? Then H=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars at turns 2 to 9? Because at turn2 we are at y=1, turn3 at y=2, ... turn9 at y=8, turn10 at y=9 (safe). So we need to check freeways 1 to 8 at turns 2 to 9.\n\nBut we must check if at turn T (from 2 to 9) the freeway y_T = T-1 is safe? Actually, at turn T, the player is at y_T. For T=2: y2=1 -> check freeway1 at turn2. T=3: y3=2 -> freeway2 at turn3, etc.\n\nSo we need to check:\n\nTurn2: freeway1\nTurn3: freeway2\n...\nTurn9: freeway8\n\nIf all these are safe at the corresponding turns, then we can go straight up in 9 actions.\n\nBut let's check the cars at these turns.\n\nFirst, we need to compute the car positions at turn T for each freeway.\n\nWe are at turn1. We consider T from 1 to, say, 20.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the set of turns T for which it is unsafe (0 is covered).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=0, tau=-47, d='right', s=48)\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   At turn T: \n        tail_T = tau + s*(T-1) = -47 + 48*(T-1)\n        head_T = h + s*(T-1) = 0 + 48*(T-1)\n   The span is [tail_T, head_T] = [-47+48*(T-1), 0+48*(T-1)]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [tail_T, head_T]:\n        tail_T <= 0 <= head_T\n        => -47+48*(T-1) <= 0 <= 48*(T-1)\n\nSolve:\n  0 <= 48*(T-1) -> always true for T>=1.\n\n  -47+48*(T-1) <= 0\n  => 48*(T-1) <= 47\n  => T-1 <= 47/48 < 1 -> so T <= 1.something -> so only T=1? \n\nAt T=1: \n   tail_1 = -47+48*(0) = -47\n   head_1 = 0\n   so [ -47, 0 ] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\nBut at T=1, the player is at (0,0) -> not on freeway1, so we don't care about freeway1 at turn1.\n\nAt T=2:\n   tail_2 = -47+48*1 = 1\n   head_2 = 0+48*1 = 48\n   So [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, for T>=2, tail_T = -47+48*(T-1) >= -47+48=1>0, so 0 is never in the interval again.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe for T>=2.\n\nFreeway2: same car: (0,-47,right,48) -> same as freeway1: safe for T>=2.\n\nFreeway3: (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nRight-moving: \n   tail_T = -55 + 4*(T-1)\n   head_T = -44 + 4*(T-1)\n\nWe need: tail_T <= 0 <= head_T\n   => -55+4*(T-1) <= 0 <= -44+4*(T-1)\n\nFirst, 0 <= -44+4*(T-1) -> 4*(T-1) >= 44 -> T-1>=11 -> T>=12.\n\nSecond, -55+4*(T-1) <=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=55 -> T-1<=13.75 -> T<=14.75 -> T<=14.\n\nSo for T in [12,14]: unsafe.\n\nAt T=12: \n   tail_12 = -55+4*11 = -55+44 = -11\n   head_12 = -44+44 = 0 -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> yes.\n\nAt T=13: \n   tail_13 = -55+4*12 = -55+48 = -7\n   head_13 = -44+48=4 -> [ -7,4] -> 0 included.\n\nAt T=14:\n   tail_14 = -55+4*13 = -55+52=-3\n   head_14 = -44+52=8 -> [ -3,8] -> 0 included.\n\nAt T=15: \n   tail_15 = -55+4*14 = -55+56=1\n   head_15 = -44+56=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway3 is unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3: unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway5: has three cars. We must check each.\n\nCar1: (-42,-53,right,6)\n   tail_T = -53 + 6*(T-1)\n   head_T = -42 + 6*(T-1)\n\n   Check: tail_T <=0<=head_T\n   => -53+6*(T-1)<=0 and 0<=-42+6*(T-1)\n\n   Second inequality: 6*(T-1)>=42 -> T-1>=7 -> T>=8.\n   First inequality: 6*(T-1)<=53 -> T-1<=53/6≈8.83 -> T<=9.83 -> T<=9.\n\n   So T in [8,9]:\n        T=8: tail_8=-53+6*7=-53+42=-11; head_8=-42+42=0 -> unsafe (0 is in [-11,0])\n        T=9: tail_9=-53+6*8=-53+48=-5; head_9=-42+48=6 -> unsafe (0 in [-5,6])\n\n   T=10: tail_10=-53+54=1; head_10=-42+54=12 -> safe.\n\nCar2: (-6,-17,right,6)\n   tail_T = -17+6*(T-1)\n   head_T = -6+6*(T-1)\n\n   Check: \n        -17+6*(T-1)<=0 -> 6*(T-1)<=17 -> T-1<=17/6≈2.83 -> T<=3.83 -> T<=3\n        0<=-6+6*(T-1) -> 6*(T-1)>=6 -> T-1>=1 -> T>=2\n\n   So T in [2,3]:\n        T=2: tail_2=-17+6*1=-11; head_2=-6+6=0 -> unsafe? [ -11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n        T=3: tail_3=-17+12=-5; head_3=-6+12=6 -> unsafe.\n\n   T=4: tail_4=-17+18=1; head_4=-6+18=12 -> safe.\n\nCar3: (30,19,right,6) \n   Note: the representation is (head, tail) for right? The problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But wait, the initial state is given as (h, tau) = (30,19). For right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] = [19,30]? But the update: [19+6*(T-1), 30+6*(T-1)]. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h]? But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I think the head and tail are defined as the leading and trailing? For right-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost? So the initial span is [tail, head] = [19,30]? But the update then becomes [19+6*(T-1), 30+6*(T-1)].\n\n   So at turn T, the car is [19+6*(T-1), 30+6*(T-1)].\n\n   This interval is always positive? At T=1: [19,30] -> doesn't cover 0. And for T>=1, the left bound is at least 19, so 0 is never covered.\n\n   So car3 is safe for all T.\n\nTherefore, freeway5 is unsafe if any of the cars cover 0. So:\n   T=2,3: unsafe because of car2.\n   T=8,9: unsafe because of car1.\n\n   And safe for T not in {2,3,8,9}.\n\nFreeway6: two cars.\n\nCar1: (52,41,right,4) -> initial span for right: [41,52]? Then update: [41+4*(T-1), 52+4*(T-1)] -> always positive, so safe.\n\nCar2: (4,-7,right,4) -> initial span: [-7,4]? Then update: [-7+4*(T-1), 4+4*(T-1)]\n\n   Check: \n        -7+4*(T-1) <=0 and 0<=4+4*(T-1) -> the second is always true for T>=1.\n\n        First: -7+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=7 -> T-1<=1.75 -> T<=2.75 -> T<=2.\n\n        So unsafe for T=1 and T=2? \n\n        T=1: [-7,4] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        T=2: [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\n        T=3: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway6 is unsafe at T=1 and T=2? But note at T=1 the player is not on freeway6? We only care when the player is on freeway6 at that turn.\n\nSo unsafe at T=1 and T=2 for freeway6? But the player might be on freeway6 at turn T only if T>=2? (since we start at turn1 at y=0, then at turn2 we might be at y=1, not y=6). So we note: freeway6 is unsafe at T=1 and T=2.\n\nBut wait: the car update is linear and the unsafe turns are only T=1 and T=2? Then for T>=3, freeway6 is safe.\n\nFreeway7: (24,47,left,24) -> left-moving: \n   head_T = 24 - 24*(T-1)\n   tail_T = 47 - 24*(T-1)   [but wait: the initial span is [head, tail] = [24,47]? That would be from 24 to 47, but then moving left? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n\n   However, note: the initial representation: (head, tail) = (24,47). For left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Or the leading? Actually, the update moves the entire car to the left. The initial span [24,47] becomes [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)]. \n\n   But note: 24-24*(T-1) and 47-24*(T-1) are decreasing.\n\n   We need to check if 0 is in [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)].\n\n   This interval is [24(1-(T-1)), 47(1-(T-1))] but actually:\n\n   T=1: [24,47] -> doesn't cover 0.\n   T=2: [24-24,47-24] = [0,23] -> 0 included? Yes, because [0,23] includes 0.\n   T=3: [24-48,47-48]=[-24,-1] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n   So unsafe at T=2.\n\n   But note: the interval at T=2: [0,23] -> includes 0.\n\n   T>=3: negative, so safe.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: unsafe at T=2.\n\nSummary of unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at T=1 (but we don't care because at T=1 we are at y=0) and safe for T>=2.\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: safe for T>=2.\nFreeway3: unsafe at T=12,13,14.\nFreeway4: same: unsafe at T=12,13,14.\nFreeway5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9.\nFreeway6: unsafe at T=1,2 -> but T=1: we are not on freeway6, so only T=2 matters? Actually, if we are at freeway6 at turn2, it is unsafe. And note: at turn2 we might be at freeway1, not freeway6. But if we are at freeway6 at any turn T, then T must be at least 2? But freeway6 is unsafe at T=2. Then safe for T>=3.\nFreeway7: unsafe at T=2.\nFreeway8: unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow, we plan the path:\n\nWe start at turn1: y1=0.\n\nWe take an action at turn1 to go to y2.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the earliest turn.\n\nWe consider a BFS:\n\nState: (turn, y)\n\nWe start: (1,0) -> safe.\n\nFrom (1,0), we can do:\n   U: to (2,1)\n   D: to (2,0) -> but then we are still at y=0, safe but not progressing.\n   S: to (2,0)\n\nWe are trying to minimize the number of actions, so we prefer moving up.\n\nBut we must avoid unsafe states.\n\nCheck (2,1): freeway1 at turn2 -> we computed freeway1 is safe at turn2 -> safe.\n\n(2,0): safe.\n\nNow, from (2,1): we can go to (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)\n\nCheck (3,2): freeway2 at turn3 -> freeway2 is safe for T>=2 -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5? freeway5 is unsafe at T=2,3,8,9. But at turn3, we are at freeway2, not freeway5. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the current row.\n\nSo from (2,1) we can go to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, we can try to go straight up:\n\nTurn1: at (1,0) -> action U -> turn2: (2,1) [freeway1: safe]\nTurn2: at (2,1) -> action U -> turn3: (3,2) [freeway2: safe]\nTurn3: at (3,2) -> action U -> turn4: (4,3) [freeway3: safe?]\n\nBut wait, freeway3 is unsafe at T=12,13,14. But we are at turn4. Is freeway3 safe at turn4? \n   We computed: freeway3 unsafe only at T=12,13,14 -> so turn4 is safe.\n\nTurn4: (4,3) -> action U -> turn5: (5,4) [freeway4: safe?] -> freeway4 unsafe at 12,13,14 -> turn5 safe.\nTurn5: (5,4) -> action U -> turn6: (6,5) [freeway5: at turn6? freeway5 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9 -> turn6 is safe (6 not in {2,3,8,9})]\nTurn6: (6,5) -> action U -> turn7: (7,6) [freeway6: at turn7? freeway6 unsafe at T=1,2 -> safe for T>=3 -> safe]\nTurn7: (7,6) -> action U -> turn8: (8,7) [freeway7: at turn8? freeway7 unsafe at T=2 -> safe for T>=3 -> safe?]\nTurn8: (8,7) -> action U -> turn9: (9,8) [freeway8: at turn9? freeway8 unsafe at T=2 -> safe for T>=3 -> safe?]\nTurn9: (9,8) -> action U -> turn10: (10,9) -> goal.\n\nSo we have a path: 9 actions.\n\nBut wait: at turn8 we are at freeway7? Actually, at turn8: we are at y=7 -> freeway7? Then we check freeway7 at turn8: safe? Yes, because unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, turn9: freeway8 at turn9: safe? Yes.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn8 and turn9? We are not at freeway5 at turn8 and turn9. We are at freeway7 and freeway8 respectively.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n   turn1: U\n   turn2: U\n   turn3: U\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait: we must check freeway5 at the turns we are on freeway5: we were on freeway5 at turn6? \n   turn6: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn6: we computed freeway5 is safe at turn6? \n        freeway5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9 -> so T=6 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn8? We are not at freeway5 at turn8, so we don't care.\n\nSo this path is safe? But wait, at turn2 we are at freeway1 (safe) and at turn3 at freeway2 (safe), and so on.\n\nBut note: freeway5 is unsafe at turn8 and turn9, but we are at freeway7 and freeway8 at those turns, so safe.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut is there a problem? We must check freeway5 at the turn we are on freeway5: that is at turn6 (when we are at y=5). And turn6 is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway6? We are on freeway6 at turn7: \n   freeway6: unsafe at T=1,2 -> so at turn7: safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can go straight up.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7 at turn8? We computed freeway7 is safe for T>=3, and turn8>=3 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway8 at turn9: safe.\n\nSo the answer is 9 actions: all U.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn6: \n   freeway5 has three cars. We need to check if at turn6, 0 is covered by any car.\n\n   Car1: (-42,-53,right,6): at turn6: \n        tail_6 = -53+6*(6-1)= -53+30 = -23\n        head_6 = -42+30 = -12 -> interval [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n   Car2: (-6,-17,right,6): \n        tail_6 = -17+30=13\n        head_6 = -6+30=24 -> [13,24] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n   Car3: (30,19,right,6): \n        Actually, the initial representation: (head, tail) = (30,19) for right? \n        Then at turn6: \n             tail_6 = 19+6*5=19+30=49\n             head_6=30+30=60 -> [49,60] -> no.\n\n   So freeway5 at turn6: safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn7: \n   Car1: (52,41,right,4): \n        tail_7 = 41+4*(7-1)=41+24=65\n        head_7=52+24=76 -> safe.\n   Car2: (4,-7,right,4):\n        tail_7 = -7+4*6=-7+24=17\n        head_7=4+24=28 -> [17,28] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 and the sequence is all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9 actions.\n\nSo the output:\n\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut wait: the answer format: \n   Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n   Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n   ...\n\nt_1=1, so:\n\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\n...\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: after the 9th action (at turn9) we get to y_{10}=9. So we are done.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and H=9, so actions at turns 1 to 9.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut is there a faster way? We cannot jump multiple rows in one turn. So 9 is the minimal.\n\nBut what if we could skip some freeways by going down? That would take more steps. So 9 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the unsafe turns. For example, if we had been forced to wait at some freeway because of an unsafe turn, then we might take more steps. But in this case, we didn't have to wait.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We cannot: we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9: at least 9 moves up.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the number of actions? The problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". And we have H=9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait: what about the car at freeway7 and freeway8 at turn2? They are unsafe. But in our path, we are not at freeway7 or freeway8 at turn2. We are at freeway1 at turn2 and freeway2 at turn3, etc.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if we tried to go to freeway7 at an unsafe turn? We don't.\n\nSo we are confident.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9.

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: for each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed, I can find where it is at any future turn. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The player is on y_T at turn T only if they are moving to or staying on that row. When moving, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and if they move to y_{T+1}, they are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\" So, at each turn, you are only concerned with the cars on your current row for collision.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, player is at (0, y_T). If action a_T is U, y_{T+1} = y_T + 1; D, y_{T+1} = y_T - 1; S, y_{T+1} = y_T.\n\nCollision: at turn T, for the row y_T, if there is any car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision occurs.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 2 onwards to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nCurrent turn: t_1 = 2, player at y=1.\n\nFreeways: y=1 to 8, each has cars listed.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway at turn t=2.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, and head=48, tail=1, that means the car is from left to right? The update rule says for right-moving: span(t) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is larger than tail? In the update, for right: span(t) = [τ, h] and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for k=1: (48,1,right,48)\n\nSo head=48, tail=1, direction=right.\n\nAt time t, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] since right-moving.\n\nThen at time T, span = [1 + 48*(T-2), 48 + 48*(T-2)] for T>2.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: same as k=1: (48,1,right,48), so span at T: [1 + 48*(T-2), 48 + 48*(T-2)]\n\nk=3: (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nhead=-40, tail=-51, direction right.\n\nSince right, span at t=2: [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nAt T, [ -51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2) ]\n\nSimilarly, k=4: same as k=3: (-40,-51,right,4), so same span.\n\nk=5: three cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor each:\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, span at t=2: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 6*(T-2), -36 + 6*(T-2) ]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, span at t=2: [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 6*(T-2), 0 + 6*(T-2) ] = [ -11 +6ΔT, 6ΔT ] where ΔT = T-2\n\nThird car: head=36, tail=25, span at t=2: [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 + 6*(T-2), 36 + 6*(T-2)]\n\nk=6: two cars: (56,45,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, span at t=2: [45,56]\n\nAt T: [45 +4*(T-2), 56 +4*(T-2)]\n\nSecond car: head=8, tail=-3, span at t=2: [-3,8]\n\nAt T: [-3 +4*(T-2), 8 +4*(T-2)]\n\nk=7: (0,23,left,24)\n\nDirection left, head=0, tail=23? For left-moving, the head is the front, which for left should be smaller if moving left.\n\nIn update: left-moving, span(t) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nHere head=0, tail=23, direction left.\n\nSo at t=2, span = [h, τ] = [0,23]\n\nAt T, [0 -24*(T-2), 23 -24*(T-2)] = [ -24ΔT, 23 -24ΔT ] with ΔT=T-2\n\nk=8: same as k=7: (0,23,left,24), so same.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 at turn T=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 8 rows. Each U action moves up one, so minimum H=8 if I can go straight up without stopping or down, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nSince I can only move one row per turn, and I have to be on each row at some point, but I can stay or move down, but that might increase H, so probably I should only move up or stay, but staying might be necessary to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal H is at least the vertical distance, which is 8, so if possible in 8 turns, but likely not due to cars.\n\nNow, at each turn, when I am on a row, I need that at that turn, for that row, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, since the cars move, the spans change over time.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - 2, so time relative to turn 2.\n\nFor freeway k=1 (y=1): one car with span at T: [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\nCollision at y=1 at turn T if 0 is in [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\nSince the span is from left to right, and 0 is the position.\n\n0 in [L, R] means L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo for k=1: 1 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 48ΔT\n\n1 + 48ΔT <= 0? 48ΔT <= -1, so ΔT <= -1/48, but ΔT >=0 since T>=2, so 1 + 48ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 < L, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0. Similarly R>0, so for all T>=2, L =1 +48ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 is less than L, not in span. So no collision possible on y=1 at any time? But at ΔT=0, T=2, span [1,48], 0<1, so not in, yes. And as ΔT increases, L and R increase, so always L>0, so no collision on y=1 ever. Is that right?\n\nΔT=0, [1,48], 0 not in [1,48] since 0<1.\n\nΔT=1, T=3, [1+48,48+48]=[49,96], 0<49, not in.\n\nSo yes, for y=1, no car ever causes collision at x=0, because the car starts at 1 and moves right, so 0 is always left of it.\n\nSimilarly for k=2, same thing, y=2: car [1 +48ΔT,48+48ΔT], always L>=1>0, so no collision on y=2 either.\n\nk=1 is y=1, k=2 is y=2, both have similar cars, so no collision possible on y=1 or y=2.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, turn 2. Since no collision on y=1 at turn 2, I can be there safely.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9, so I should move up.\n\nBut let's check other freeways.\n\nk=3: y=3, car: at T, span [ -51 +4ΔT, -40 +4ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [L,R], so L <= 0 <= R.\n\nL = -51 +4ΔT, R = -40 +4ΔT\n\nSo -51 +4ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -40 +4ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= -40 +4ΔT ⇒ 4ΔT >=40 ⇒ ΔT >=10\n\nSecond, -51 +4ΔT <=0 ⇒ 4ΔT <=51 ⇒ ΔT <= 12.75, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <=12\n\nSo for ΔT from 10 to 12 inclusive, collision on y=3.\n\nΔT=10: L= -51+40= -11, R= -40+40=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since it's <= R, and R=0, so yes, 0 in [ -11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=11: L= -51+44= -7, R= -40+44=4, [ -7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=12: L= -51+48= -3, R= -40+48=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=13: L= -51+52=1, R= -40+52=12, [1,12], 0<1 not in.\n\nSo collision on y=3 at T=12,13,14? ΔT=10,11,12 → T=12,13,14.\n\nTurn T: since t_1=2, ΔT=T-2, so T=2 + ΔT.\n\nSo for y=3, collision at turns T=12,13,14.\n\nk=4: same as k=3, y=4, same car, same spans, so collision at same times: T=12,13,14.\n\nNow k=5: y=5, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6), span at T: [ -47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -47+6ΔT, -36+6ΔT ]\n\nSo -47+6ΔT <=0 and 0 <= -36+6ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= -36+6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT >=36 ⇒ ΔT >=6\n\nSecond, -47+6ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6ΔT <=47 ⇒ ΔT <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so ΔT <=7\n\nΔT integer, so ΔT from 6 to 7.\n\nΔT=6: L= -47+36= -11, R= -36+36=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=7: L= -47+42= -5, R= -36+42=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=8: L= -47+48=1, R= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at ΔT=6,7 → T=8,9\n\nSecond car on k=5: (0,-11,right,6), span at T: [ -11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT ] = [ -11+6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -11+6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nSo -11+6ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 6ΔT\n\n0 <= 6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\n-11+6ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nAlso, since L <=0, and R>=0 only if 6ΔT >=0, which is true.\n\nFor ΔT=0: L= -11, R=0, [ -11,0], 0 in since R=0.\n\nΔT=1: L= -11+6= -5, R=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=2: L= -11+12=1, R=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1 → T=2 and T=3.\n\nThird car on k=5: (36,25,right,6), span at T: [25 +6ΔT, 36 +6ΔT]\n\nL=25+6ΔT >=25>0, so always L>0, so 0 not in span, no collision.\n\nSo for y=5, collisions from:\n\n- Second car at T=2 and T=3\n\n- First car at T=8 and T=9\n\nAt T=2, ΔT=0, second car has span [ -11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt T=3, ΔT=1, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=8, ΔT=6, first car [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=9, ΔT=7, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nNow k=6: y=6, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4), span [45+4ΔT, 56+4ΔT], L>=45>0, so no collision.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4), span [ -3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -3+4ΔT, 8+4ΔT ]\n\nSo -3+4ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 8+4ΔT\n\n0 <= 8+4ΔT always true.\n\n-3+4ΔT <=0 ⇒ 4ΔT <=3 ⇒ ΔT <= 0.75, so ΔT <=0 since integer.\n\nΔT=0: L= -3, R=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=1: L= -3+4=1, R=8+4=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=2, collision on y=6.\n\nNow k=7: y=7, car (0,23,left,24), left-moving.\n\nSpan at t=2: [h, τ] = [0,23]\n\nAt T: [0 -24ΔT, 23 -24ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [L,R] = [ -24ΔT, 23 -24ΔT ]\n\nNow, since it's left-moving, and L = -24ΔT, R=23-24ΔT\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <=0 and 0<=R.\n\nL = -24ΔT <=0 always for ΔT>=0.\n\n0<= R ⇒ 0 <= 23-24ΔT ⇒ 24ΔT <=23 ⇒ ΔT <= 23/24 <1, so ΔT=0\n\nAt ΔT=0, R=23, 0<=23 true.\n\nL=0, 0<=0 true? L= -24*0=0, R=23, so [0,23], includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=1, L= -24, R=23-24= -1, [ -24, -1], 0 not in since 0 > -1? [ -24, -1], all negative, 0 > -1, so 0 not <= R, since R=-1<0.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT>1, more negative.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=2, collision on y=7.\n\nk=8: same as k=7, y=8, collision only at T=2.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each row:\n\ny=1: no collision at any time\n\ny=2: no collision at any time\n\ny=3: collision at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: collision at T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: collision at T=2,3 (from second car) and T=8,9 (from first car)\n\nAt T=2 and T=3, and T=8,T=9.\n\ny=6: collision only at T=2\n\ny=7: collision only at T=2\n\ny=8: collision only at T=2\n\ny=9: no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, y=9 is target, no cars.\n\nNow, player starts at T=2, y=1.\n\nAt T=2, on y=1, no collision, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince I need to go up, D might not help, but I can stay to avoid bad times.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=1, need to go to y=9, at least 8 moves up, so min H=8 if I can go directly.\n\nBut with collisions, I might need to delay on some rows.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nAt T=2, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nI can choose to move or stay.\n\nIf I move up to y=2 at T=3, or stay on y=1 at T=3.\n\nBut y=1 has no collision ever, so staying might not be necessary.\n\nSimilarly y=2 no collision.\n\nNow, problem is with higher rows.\n\nI need to be on each row from 1 to 9 at some turn, but I can skip rows by moving up or down, but since I have to go up, and each move changes y by 1, I must pass through each integer y between start and end, including start and end.\n\nStart y=1, end y=9, so I must be on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some point.\n\nAnd for each, I need to be there at a time when no collision on that row.\n\nAlso, since I move one per turn, the turn when I am on a row depends on the sequence.\n\nNow, let's list the forbidden times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=7: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=8: unsafe only at T=2\n\ny=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nNow, at T=2, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nI need to plan the sequence of actions.\n\nSince min H=8, let's see if possible in 8 turns: from T=2 to T=9, y from 1 to 9.\n\nT=2: y=1\n\nT=3: if U, y=2\n\nT=4: U, y=3\n\nT=5: U, y=4\n\nT=6: U, y=5\n\nT=7: U, y=6\n\nT=8: U, y=7\n\nT=9: U, y=8? Let's list:\n\nStart T=2, y=1\n\nAfter action at T=2, y_{3} = y_2 + Δy\n\nNotation: at turn T, position is y_T, after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nAt turn T, perform action, then at end of turn, position is y_T, I think.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check collision for row y_T at time T.\n\nThen action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor H turns, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, so at turn 2 + H -1, y=9.\n\nMin H=8, then at turn 2+7=9, y=9.\n\nT from 2 to 9.\n\nNow, for each turn, y_T must be safe.\n\nT=2: y=1, safe\n\nT=3: y? can be 1 or 2\n\nIf I go to y=2 at T=3, or stay y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for min H=8, I need to be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nSo y_T for T=2 to 9: must be from 1 to 9 increasing, but I can stay or go down, but that would increase H, so for min H, probably only U actions, except when need to avoid.\n\nBut with U only, y_T = 1 + (T-2) for T from 2 to 9? T=2, y=1; T=3, y=2; ... T=9, y=8? No.\n\nT=2, y=1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=3\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=8? Let's index.\n\nSet t = turn, from 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nFor H=8, turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nAt turn 2, y_2=1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 set.\n\ny_3 depends on a_2.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 on a_3, etc.\n\nAt turn 9, y_9 must be 9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9 = y_8 +1\n\nBut y_9=9, so y_8 must be 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7, so if a_7=U, y_8= y_7 +1, so y_7=7, etc.\n\nGenerally, for min path, with only U, y_T = 1 + (T-2) for T=2 to 9? T=2, y=1; T=3, y=2; T=4, y=3; T=5, y=4; T=6, y=5; T=7, y=6; T=8, y=7; T=9, y=8? But we need y_9=9, not 8.\n\nProblem: at turn T=9, y_9 must be 9.\n\nBut with actions from T=2 to T=8, y from T=2 to T=9.\n\ny_2 =1\n\ny_3 = y_2 + a_2 action\n\n...\n\ny_9 = y_8 + a_8 action\n\nTo have y_9=9, since y_2=1, we need 8 net up moves.\n\nIn 8 turns, from T=2 to T=9, there are 7 actions: a_2 to a_8, each can be U,D,S, affecting y_3 to y_9.\n\ny_3 depends on a_2, y_4 on a_3, ..., y_9 on a_8.\n\ny_2 is given, not changed by action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is before action or after? In the sequence, at the start of turn T, position is y_T, then we perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_end, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nFor min H, T_end should be as small as possible.\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=1, min T_end is 10 if we move up every turn: T=2 y=1, a_2=U, y_3=2; a_3=U, y_4=3; ... a_8=U, y_9=8; a_9=U, y_{10}=9. So at turn 10, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nHere t_1=2, so at turn 2 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIf we go directly up, at turn 2: y=1, action U\n\nturn 3: y=2, action U\n\n...\n\nturn 9: y=8, action U\n\nturn 10: y=9\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9, so H=9 turns: turns 2 to 10, 9 turns, 2+ H-1=10, so H=9.\n\nSimilarly, min possible H is 9 if no delays.\n\nBut with collisions, we might need more.\n\nFirst, let's see if H=9 is possible with only U actions.\n\nPath: T=2, y=1, safe\n\nT=3, y=2, safe\n\nT=4, y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=12,13,14, T=4 is early, safe? Forbidden times: y=3 unsafe only at 12,13,14, so at T=4, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=5, y=4, unsafe at 12,13,14, so T=5 safe.\n\nT=6, y=5, now y=5 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nT=6 is not in {2,3,8,9}, so safe? T=6, ΔT=4, for y=5.\n\nAt T=6, ΔT=4, for first car on y=5, L= -47+6*4= -47+24= -23, R= -36+24= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no.\n\nSo y=5 safe at T=6.\n\nT=7, y=6, y=6 unsafe only at T=2, so T=7 safe.\n\nT=8, y=7, y=7 unsafe only at T=2, so T=8 safe.\n\nT=9, y=8, y=8 unsafe only at T=2, so T=9 safe.\n\nThen at T=10, y=9, but in this sequence, at T=9, y=8, after action U, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut at turn T=9, we are at y=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen action a_9=U, so at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from start to end, with end at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, to have y=9 at turn 10, so t_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=2, so 2 + H -1=10, H=9.\n\nAnd at turn 10, y=9, no need to check collision since no cars on y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, for U only:\n\nTurn 2: y=1, safe\n\nAction a_2=U\n\nTurn 3: y=2, safe\n\na_3=U\n\nTurn 4: y=3, safe (since unsafe only at 12-14)\n\na_4=U\n\nTurn 5: y=4, safe\n\na_5=U\n\nTurn 6: y=5, safe (as above)\n\na_6=U\n\nTurn 7: y=6, safe\n\na_7=U\n\nTurn 8: y=7, safe\n\na_8=U\n\nTurn 9: y=8, safe (only unsafe at T=2)\n\na_9=U\n\nTurn 10: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at turn 9, we perform action to go to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=9, turns from 2 to 10, 9 turns.\n\nAt each turn, y_T is safe as above.\n\ny=5 at T=6: safe, yes.\n\nBut in y=5, there is a car at T=2 and T=3 unsafe, and T=8,9 unsafe, but T=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo it seems I can go directly up in 9 turns with no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm y=5 at T=6.\n\nT=6, ΔT=4.\n\nCars on y=5:\n\nFirst car: span [ -47 +6*4, -36 +6*4] = [ -47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 +24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no.\n\nSafe.\n\ny=6 at T=7: only unsafe at T=2, safe.\n\ny=7 at T=8: unsafe only at T=2, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=9: unsafe only at T=2, safe.\n\nSo yes, with all U actions, I reach y=9 at turn 10, H=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require reaching at turn 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9, so H=8, at turn 9 y=9.\n\nBut to have y=9 at turn 9, since y_2=1, I need to increase by 8 in 7 actions? From turn 2 to turn 9, 7 actions: a_2 to a_8.\n\ny_2=1\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\n...\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_9=9.\n\nThe number of U actions must be 8 more than D actions, but since start y=1, end y=9, net +8.\n\nWith 7 actions, if all U, y_9 = y_2 + 7 = 1+7=8, which is less than 9.\n\ny_2=1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy, so if a_2=U, y_3=2\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=8\n\nThen to have y_9=9, I need an additional action, a_9=U, y_{10}=9.\n\nSo minimum H is 9, since I need 8 up moves, and each up move requires a turn to perform the action and be at the new position.\n\nWith H turns, there are H-1 actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-2, determining positions from t_1+1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} set\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} set\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -2}, y_{t_1 + H -1} set to 9.\n\nSo for position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, we need exactly H-1 actions, and the net displacement must be +8.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nSo to have net +8, with K actions, the number of U must be D + 8, and S any, but S don't help.\n\nMin K=8 actions, all U, net +8.\n\nWith K actions, positions from t_1 +1 to t_1 + K.\n\ny_{t_1 + K} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + K -1}\n\nSet y_{t_1 + K} =9, y_{t_1}=1, so sum Δy = 8.\n\nWith K actions? Actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + K -1}, that's K actions, determining y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + K}.\n\ny_{t_1 + K} = y_{t_1} + sum_{i=0}^{K-1} Δy_{t_1 + i}\n\nSet to 9, so sum = 8.\n\nIf all U, sum=K, so K=8.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + K} = y_{t_1 + 8} =9.\n\nNow, t_1=2, so at turn 2 + 8 =10? t_1 + K, K=8, turn 2+8=10.\n\nH is the number of turns, from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor H turns, the last position is at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nSum Δy must be 8.\n\nIf all U, sum = H-1, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nIf some S or D, sum < H-1, so to have sum=8, H-1 >=8, H>=9.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, achieved with all U actions, no S or D.\n\nIn this case, with the collision times, as above, it seems possible with all U actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFor H=9, turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nAt turn 2: y=1, safe, action a_2=U\n\nThen y_3=2\n\nTurn 3: y=2, safe, action a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nTurn 4: y=3, safe (T=4 not 12,13,14), action a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nTurn 5: y=4, safe (T=5 not 12-14), action a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nTurn 6: y=5, now T=6, y=5, safe as we saw, action a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nTurn 7: y=6, T=7, safe (only unsafe T=2), action a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nTurn 8: y=7, T=8, safe, action a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nTurn 9: y=8, T=9, safe (only unsafe T=2), action a_9=U, y_{10}=9\n\nTurn 10: y=9, reached.\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision.\n\nSo with H=9, all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and H=9 seems minimal and possible.\n\nBut is there a reason to have H larger? No, since min is 9.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=5, at T=8 and T=9 unsafe, but in this path, at T=6 we are on y=5, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=4, safe.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nBut let me double-check the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions for each turn from t_1 to the turn before reaching, but in the answer, it says: for each turn, the action.\n\nIn the box: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to the last action.\n\nSince at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we might not perform an action, but the sequence includes actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2, I think.\n\nLet's see the answer format: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after these actions, we should be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1, position to be 9? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nFrom the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions? t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position should be (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, but turns are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 for actions, and position reached at t_1 + H.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the state after actions.\n\nIn the context, \"turns H\" probably includes the starting turn.\n\nBut let's see: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAfter H actions, we reach the position.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, before any action, position is given.\n\nThen we perform a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen perform a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, etc.\n\nAfter performing a_{t_1 + H -1}, we set y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions? t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, to go from y=1 to y=2, one action U at t_1, then y_{t_1 +1}=2, so H=1 action, reached at turn t_1+1.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 from y=1, need 8 U actions, so H=8 actions, reached at turn t_1 +8.\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, so with 8 U actions, reached at turn 10.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nThen sequence for t=0 to 7: a_2 to a_9, all U.\n\nThen y_{10}=9.\n\nAnd at each intermediate turn, we need no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is turn 2 to 9, we are at position y_t for t=2 to 9, and perform action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, we check collision for row y_t at time t.\n\nThen after action, y_{t+1} set.\n\nWith H=8 actions: a_2 to a_9.\n\nAt turn 2: y_2=1, safe\n\nAction a_2=U, set y_3=2\n\nTurn 3: y_3=2, safe\n\nAction a_3=U, set y_4=3\n\nTurn 4: y_4=3, safe (T=4 not 12-14)\n\nAction a_4=U, set y_5=4\n\nTurn 5: y_5=4, safe (T=5 not 12-14)\n\nAction a_5=U, set y_6=5\n\nTurn 6: y_6=5, T=6, safe as before\n\nAction a_6=U, set y_7=6\n\nTurn 7: y_7=6, T=7, safe (only unsafe T=2)\n\nAction a_7=U, set y_8=7\n\nTurn 8: y_8=7, T=8, safe\n\nAction a_8=U, set y_9=8\n\nTurn 9: y_9=8, T=9, safe (only unsafe T=2)\n\nAction a_9=U, set y_{10}=9\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9.\n\nAnd collision avoided at all points.\n\nSo minimal H=8 actions? H is the number of turns? The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAnd \"turns\" probably refers to the game turns.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H turns are involved: turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor each turn, we have an action.\n\nAfter H turns, we have performed H actions, and the position is at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nWith y_{t_1} =1, we need to increase by 8, so H=8 if all U, y_{t_1 +8} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, y_{10}=9.\n\nH=8 turns: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 9, we perform the last action.\n\nPosition reached at turn 10.\n\nBut in the turn list, turn 9 is included.\n\nThe minimal H is 8 for the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm with the collision.\n\nAt turn 2: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 3: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=5, T=6, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=6, T=7, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=7, T=8, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=8, T=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7? That would require reaching at turn 9 with 7 actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{2+7} = y_9=9.\n\nWith 7 actions from a_2 to a_8, setting y_3 to y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_2 + sum Δy from a_2 to a_8.\n\ny_2=1, y_9=9, so sum Δy =8.\n\nWith 7 actions, sum Δy <=7 if all U, but 7<8, impossible to have sum=8 with 7 actions. Each action contributes at most +1, so max y_9=1+7=8<9. Cannot reach y=9 with only 7 actions. So H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, with all U actions, it works.\n\nBut in the car state, for k=5, there is a car at (0,-11,right,6), which at T=2, span [-11,0], includes 0, but at T=2, we are on y=1, not y=5, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, we are on y=2, not y=5, etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all U actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns 2 to 9, actions a2 to a9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\nH=8\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is achieved after the last action.\n\nAnd collision avoided during the path.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any other constraint?\n\nThe cars on other rows, but since we are not on those rows at wrong times, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=7, and y=5 has a car that might be at unsafe position, but we are not on y=5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 8. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 9, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At each turn, the player's position \\(y_t\\) is safe because the collision times for each row do not coincide with the player's presence on that row during the sequence:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\): Always safe, as no car spans \\(x=0\\) at any turn.\n  - \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\): Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; player is on \\(y=3\\) at turn 4 and \\(y=4\\) at turn 5, both safe.\n  - \\(y = 5\\): Unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, 9; player is on \\(y=5\\) at turn 6, which is safe.\n  - \\(y = 6\\): Unsafe only at turn 2; player is on \\(y=6\\) at turn 7, safe.\n  - \\(y = 7\\): Unsafe only at turn 2; player is on \\(y=7\\) at turn 8, safe.\n  - \\(y = 8\\): Unsafe only at turn 2; player is on \\(y=8\\) at turn 9, safe.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position x=0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The position is given at turn t₁=3, and I need to find actions from turn 3 onwards. The car spans are given for turn 3, and they move linearly with their speeds.\n\nSince the cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=2, which is freeway 2. But at turn 3, I'm at (0,2), so I need to check if there's a car on freeway 2 at position x=0 at turn 3.\n\nFor freeway 2: cars are (96,49,right,48). Since it's right-moving, span at turn 3 is [τ, h] = [49,96]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h], and then at T, it's [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in Span(T) for the freeway y_T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I'm only concerned with cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nStart at turn t₁=3, position y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars. y=0 and y=9 are probably the start and end, no cars.\n\ny=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at turn H, I need to be at (0,9), which means at that turn, I move to y=9 or something.\n\nThe position is given as (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think? The player is at (0,y_t), so x=0 fixed, and we move vertically? No.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but the player moves only vertically? Let's see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U, D, S changing y.\n\nAnd cars are on horizontal freeways, each at a fixed y level, I think.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, I assume, since it says freeway y=1, etc.\n\nAnd cars move horizontally on their freeway.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0, y changes.\n\nCollision when player is at (0, y_T) and for that freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSo, at each turn, when I'm on a freeway y, I need that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nIf I'm on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I start at y=2, which is a freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all car positions at turn t₁=3.\n\nt₁=3, so for each freeway, the span at turn 3.\n\nFreeway 1: (96,49,right,48) — since right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [49,96]? Notation: it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger, I think.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h], and head h is the front, tail τ is the back, so for right-moving, since it moves right, head is to the right, so at t₁, position from τ to h, with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head to left, τ to right or something.\n\nLet's see: left-moving: span(t₁) = [h, τ], and h - s(T-t₁) etc., so if moving left, head is left, tail right, so h < τ? No.\n\nIt says: left-moving: span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], increasing x.\n\nAnd for collision, 0 in [low, high] or [high, low]? Span is an interval, but it might be unordered.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it moves right.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving [h, τ] with h < τ? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (96,49,right,48) — head 96, tail 49, since right, so at t₁, positions from 49 to 96, so min 49, max 96.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same: (96,49,right,48)\n\nFreeway 3: (-36,-47,right,4) — head -36, tail -47, since right, tail should be left of head, so if right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -36 > -47, yes, so min τ=-47, max h=-36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-36,-47,right,4) same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6)\n\nFor each, since right, tail to head.\n\nFirst car: tail -41, head -30, so span [-41,-30]? Positions from low to high.\n\nSimilarly, second: tail -5, head 6? (6,-5,right,6), tail -5, head 6, so span [-5,6]\n\nBut -5 to 6, with tail -5, head 6.\n\nThird: (42,31,right,6), tail 31, head 42, span [31,42]\n\nFreeway 6: (60,49,right,4), tail 49, head 60, span [49,60]\n\nAnd (12,1,right,4), tail 1, head 12, span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-1,left,24) — left-moving, so span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1], and since left-moving, h is head, τ tail, so if moving left, head at -24, tail at -1, and since left, head is left, tail right, so positions from -24 to -1, min -24, max -1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (-24,-1,left,24) same.\n\nNow, at any turn T, the span for a car is:\n\nFor right-moving: low = τ + s(T-t₁), high = h + s(T-t₁)\n\nFor left-moving: low = h - s(T-t₁), high = τ - s(T-t₁)\n\nThen 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSince the intervals are contiguous, I think.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nBut for freeway with multiple cars, I need to check all.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 3, y=2.\n\nFirst, at turn 3, on freeway 2, is there a car with 0 in span?\n\nFreeway 2: car (96,49,right,48), at T=3, ΔT=0, so span [49,96], 0 not in [49,96], so safe. Similarly, no other cars on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has only one car, I think? From table, only one entry for freeway 2: (96,49,right,48), so only one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1: same, one car, span [49,96] at T=3, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I just need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut I need to minimize turns, so probably move up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nActions: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0 or 9, I can't go below or above, but since we start at y=2, and go to y=9, we can assume that if I try to go down from y=0, it stays, similarly up from 9, but since we go to 9, it's fine.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns to change y from 2 to 9 is 7, if I go up each turn.\n\nBut I may need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nSo, I need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each future turn, when is position x=0 occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for turn T, is there a car such that 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen, if I plan to be on freeway k at turn T, it must be that no car on k has 0 occupied at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all on that freeway.\n\nAlso, for freeways with no cars, always safe, but here all freeways have cars except possibly some, but all listed have cars.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars, etc.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span evolution.\n\nt₁=3, so for turn T, ΔT = T - 3.\n\nLet t = T - 3, so t=0 is turn 3, t=1 turn 4, etc.\n\nI'll use t relative to start.\n\nAt time step τ = T - t₁ = T - 3.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=48, span at τ: low = τ + 48τ, high = h + 48τ = 49 + 48τ to 96 + 48τ? No.\n\nAt T, for right-moving car: low = τ + s(T-3) = 49 + 48(T-3)\n\nHigh = h + s(T-3) = 96 + 48(T-3)\n\n0 in [low, high] if 49 + 48τ <= 0 <= 96 + 48τ where τ = T-3\n\nSince 49 + 48τ > 0 for τ>=0, and increasing, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 never in span for τ>=0. Similarly for high, always positive, so never 0 in span. So freeway 1 is always safe for T>=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same thing, always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: (96,49,right,48), same as freeway 1, so also always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: car (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nRight-moving, so low = τ + sτ = -47 + 4τ  (since τ = T-3)\n\nHigh = h + sτ = -36 + 4τ\n\n0 in [low, high] if -47 + 4τ <= 0 <= -36 + 4τ\n\nBut -47 + 4τ <= 0 when τ <= 47/4 = 11.75, so τ <=11\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 4τ when 4τ >=36, τ >=9\n\nSo for τ=9 to 11, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same car, (-36,-47,right,4), so same, unsafe for τ=9,10,11.\n\nτ = T-3, so for T=12,13,14? τ=9: T=12, τ=10:T=13, τ=11:T=14.\n\nτ=9: T=3+9=12, τ=10:T=13, τ=11:T=14.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30,-41,right,6), low = -41 + 6τ, high = -30 + 6τ\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6τ <= 0 <= -30 + 6τ\n\nWhich is τ <= 41/6≈6.833, τ<=6; and τ >= 30/6=5, so τ=5,6\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), low = -5 + 6τ, high = 6 + 6τ\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6τ <= 0 <= 6 + 6τ\n\n-5 + 6τ <=0 when τ <= 5/6≈0.833, so τ=0 only? τ integer, τ=0: -5<=0<=6, yes; τ=1: -5+6=1>0, not <=0, so low=1, high=12, 0 not in.\n\n-5+6τ <=0 for τ <=0.833, so for τ=0, -5<=0 true, for τ=1, 1<=0 false.\n\nAnd 0 <= 6+6τ always for τ>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span only if low <=0 and high>=0.\n\nFor τ=0: low=-5 <=0, high=6>=0, yes.\n\nτ=1: low=1 >0, not <=0, so no.\n\nτ<0 not considered.\n\nSo only at τ=0, which is T=3, 0 in span.\n\nThird car: (42,31,right,6), low=31+6τ, high=42+6τ, both positive for τ>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, at τ=0 (T=3), second car has 0 in span, so unsafe at T=3.\n\nAlso, first car unsafe at τ=5,6 (T=8,9)\n\nτ=5: T=3+5=8, τ=6:T=9\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,4), low=49+4τ, high=60+4τ, always >0, never 0.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4), low=1+4τ, high=12+4τ, always >=1>0 for τ>=0, so never 0 in span. At τ=0, low=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo freeway 6 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: left-moving, (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at T: low = h - s(T-3) = -24 -24τ\n\nHigh = τ - s(T-3) = -1 -24τ\n\nSince moving left, decreasing.\n\n0 in [low, high] but low and high, which is min and max?\n\nlow = h -24τ = -24 -24τ\n\nhigh = τ -24τ = -1 -24τ\n\nSince moving left, low is left end, high is right end? But numerically, -24-24τ < -1-24τ, so min = -24-24τ, max = -1-24τ\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 <= max, so -24-24τ <=0 and 0<= -1-24τ\n\nFirst, -24-24τ <=0 always true for τ>=0? -24-24τ <=0 when -24τ <=24, multiply by -1, 24τ >= -24, always true for τ>=0.\n\nBut 0 <= -1-24τ? -1-24τ <= -1 <0, so 0 <= negative number? False for all τ.\n\n0 <= max, but max = -1-24τ <= -1 <0, so 0 > max for all τ, so 0 never <= max, hence never in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same, left-moving, same car, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-1,left,24), same as above, max = -1-24τ <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo summary of unsafe freeways at certain turns:\n\n- Freeway 1: always safe\n\n- Freeway 2: always safe\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at T=12,13,14 (τ=9,10,11)\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at T=3 (τ=0) and T=8,9 (τ=5,6)\n\n- Freeway 6: always safe\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=3,8,9.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 3, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 3, freeway 2 is safe, as we said.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), and at turn when y_t=9, I win.\n\nNow, minimal turns: from y=2 to y=9, need to increase by 7, so minimum 7 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I may need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at certain turns.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 3, I'm on y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut if I stay or move, I need to see the path.\n\nSince freeways 1,2,6,7,8 are always safe, except freeway 5 unsafe at some turns, and 3,4 at later turns.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 unsafe at T=12,13,14, which might be late if I go fast.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 unsafe at T=3,8,9.\n\nNow, at turn 3, I'm on freeway 2 (y=2), which is safe, but if I move to y=3, which is freeway 3, at turn 4? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nI start at turn 3, y=2.\n\nI choose action a_3, which determines y_{4} = y_3 + Δy, depending on a_3.\n\nThen at turn 4, I am on y_4, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am on y_T, and that freeway has a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, I am on y=2, freeway 2, which is safe at T=3.\n\nNow, I can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I need to go to y=9, down is not useful.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed if unsafe.\n\nBut at turn 3, freeway 5 (y=5) is unsafe, but I'm not on it.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nPossible to go directly up.\n\nBut at some turns, if I am on freeway 5 at turn 8 or 9, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 or 4 at turn 12-14, but that might not be issue.\n\nFirst, let's see how fast I can go.\n\nIf I go up every turn, from y=2 at turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, safe.\n\na_3: U, then y_4 = 3\n\nTurn 4: on y=3, freeway 3. At turn 4, τ=1, freeway 3 is safe? Earlier, freeway 3 unsafe only at τ=9,10,11 (T=12,13,14), so at τ=1 (T=4), safe.\n\nThen a_4: U, y_5=4\n\nTurn 5: on y=4, freeway 4. Similarly, safe at T=5.\n\na_5: U, y_6=5\n\nTurn 6: on y=5, freeway 5. Now T=6, τ=3. Freeway 5 unsafe at T=3,8,9. T=6 is not unsafe, so safe? At T=6, τ=3, freeway 5: we said unsafe at τ=0,5,6. τ=0 (T=3), τ=5 (T=8), τ=6 (T=9). T=6 is τ=3, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen a_6: U, y_7=6\n\nTurn 7: on y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\nTurn 8: on y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\nTurn 9: on y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\na_9: U, y_10=9\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reached (0,9).\n\nBut is turn 10 the turn I reach? Let's see: started turn 3 at y=2.\n\nAfter action a_3 at turn 3, y_4=3 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, after a_9 at turn 9, y_10=9 at turn 10.\n\nAnd at turn 10, I am at (0,9), which is the target.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 3 to turn 10, that's 8 turns? Turns involved: actions from turn 3 to turn 9, that's 7 actions: a3 to a9, 7 steps to go from y=2 to y=9? y2 to y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9, that's 7 moves, so at turn 10, y=9.\n\nTurns: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nTurn 3: y=2\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo after a3, y4=3\n\na4, y5=4\n\na5, y6=5\n\na6, y7=6\n\na7, y8=7\n\na8, y9=8\n\na9, y10=9\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9.\n\nAnd I used 7 actions: from t=3 to t=9.\n\nNow, in this path, I was on freeway 5 at turn 6 (y=5 at T=6).\n\nT=6, τ=3, freeway 5 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen at turn 8, I am on y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nTurn 9, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 5 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but at T=8, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, T=9, I am on y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIn this path, I never on freeway 5 at unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 unsafe later.\n\nBut in this case, I reach at turn 10.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nMinimal would be 7 turns to reach, but from y=2 to y=9, delta y=7, so at least 7 actions needed if I go up each time.\n\nWith 7 actions, I can reach at turn 10.\n\nIf I go up faster? But I can only change by +1 per turn, so minimum 7 actions.\n\nUnless I start from turn 3, but at turn 3 I am at y=2, after actions I move.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go up multiple, but no, only +1 per action.\n\nSo minimum 7 actions, reaching at turn 10.\n\nBut in the path above, it seems safe.\n\nBut at turn 6, when I am on freeway 5, is it safe?\n\nT=6, freeway 5: cars.\n\nFirst car: at τ=3, low = -41 + 6*3 = -41+18= -23, high= -30+18= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: low= -5 +6*3= -5+18=13, high=6+18=24, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: low=31+18=49, high=42+18=60, positive, no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 5 unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nIn this path, I am on freeway 5 only at T=6, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 5 unsafe at T=8,9, but not at T=6.\n\nAnother point: at turn 3, when I start, I am on y=2, but freeway 5 is unsafe at T=3.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 5 at T=3.\n\nIn the path, I move to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nIs there any issue with the starting turn?\n\nTurn 3: I am at y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nAction a3=U, go to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5 at T=3.\n\nT=3, freeway 5, second car: (6,-5,right,6), at T=3, span [-5,6], so 0 is in [-5,6], yes, so if I were on y=5 at turn 3, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, τ=5, freeway 5, first car: low= -41 +6*5= -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSo 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=6, T=9: low= -41+36= -5, high= -30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on y=5 at those times.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at T=6, safe.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions from turn 3 onwards.\n\nIn this case, with all U, I can reach in 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach at turn t1+H-1 or something.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, I reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from turn 3 to turn 9, that's 7 actions, H=7, and at turn 3+7-1=9? Let's see.\n\nt1=3, actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, y_{t1 + H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after the last action, at turn t1 + H-1, I perform a_{t1 + H-1}, and then y_{t1 + H} is the new position.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd at that turn, since y=9, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, I am on various y, must avoid collision.\n\nIn my case, with H=7, actions at t=3 to 9: a3 to a9, all U.\n\nThen y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9.\n\nt1 + H = 3 + 7 = 10, yes.\n\nAnd for turns t=3 to 9, I am on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 respectively.\n\nAt turn 3: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3. At T=4, τ=1, freeway 3: low= -47 +4*1= -43, high= -36+4= -32, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=4, freeway 4. Similarly, τ=2, low= -47+8= -39, high= -36+8= -28, negative, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=5, freeway 5, τ=3, as before, safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd at turn 10, y=9, done.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer than 7 actions? No, because y from 2 to 9, difference 7, each action changes y by at most 1, so minimum 7 actions.\n\nIf I go down or stay, it would take more turns.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=7.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I might be on an unsafe freeway.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, so for example, at turn 6, I am on y=5, and I go U to y=6.\n\nAt that moment, on freeway 5, and it is safe.\n\nBut freeway 5 unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but at those times I am on other freeways.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach faster, but I don't think so.\n\nMaybe start by staying or something, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at turn 3, I stay, y=2 still, then I need to go up later, taking more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 5 has cars, but at T=3, it is unsafe, but since I am not on it, ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, I thought always safe, but let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 6: cars (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nAt any τ, low1=49+4τ >=49>0, low2=1+4τ>=1>0, so 0 never in span, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be for each turn.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me see the turn numbers.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen at turn 10, position (0,9)\n\nBut the sequence is up to turn t1+H-1=3+7-1=9, yes.\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if I were to be on freeway 5 at T=8, but I avoid it.\n\nBut in this path, I am on y=7 at T=8, which is freeway 7, safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by not moving up at some point, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nWhich I already considered; at turn T, I am only on y_T.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let me check for freeway 3 and 4, unsafe at T=12,13,14, but since I reach at turn 10, before that, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I start from different action, but no, I have to start from y=2.\n\nUnless I go down and come back, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=1, but y=1 is always safe, but then I need to go up more, so more actions.\n\nSimilarly, not efficient.\n\nSo minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn 3, player at (0,2), freeway 2.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at turn 4.\n\nEtc.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions.\n\nBut the answer format should be in a box.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a3\n\nt=1: a4\n\n...\n\nt=6: a9\n\nAll U.\n\nSo for turn t1=3 to t1+H-1=9.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 9, when I am on y=8, and I go U to y=9, at turn 9 I am on freeway 8, which is safe.\n\ny=9 not a freeway.\n\nAll set.\n\nBut I recall that in freeway 5, at T=3, it is unsafe, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, I thought always safe, but let me double-check the left-moving cars.\n\nFreeway 7: left-moving, (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nAt T, low = h - s(T-3) = -24 -24τ\n\nHigh = τ - s(T-3) = -1 -24τ\n\nSince moving left, the position decreases.\n\nmin = -24-24τ, max = -1-24τ, both negative for τ>=0, so max <= -1 <0, so 0 not in [min,max], since min and max both less than 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all actions U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case, it works.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 3, when I start, is there any immediate danger?\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=3, but I am on y=2.\n\nIf I were to go to y=5 at some point, but I go later.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=5 at turn 6, safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly with S or something, but no need.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5 at T=3: second car has span including 0, so if I were on y=5 at turn 3, I die, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nWith H=7.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I need to write the turn numbers.\n\nNow, about the vertical axis: y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach, it's fine.\n\nIn the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with y in [0,9], so at y=9, if I go U, it might stay or not, but since I reach and stop, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, at turn 9, I go U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAnd y=9 is reached at turn 10.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I start from turn 3 with different action, but no.\n\nAnother idea: if I go up faster? But I can only go +1 per turn.\n\nUnless I am at y=2, and I go U, to y=3, etc., no faster way.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of turns.\n\nFrom start turn 3, after 0 actions, at y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action (a3=U), at turn 4, y=3.\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions, at turn 9, y=8? After a3 to a8, let's count.\n\nAfter a3 (turn 3 action), y4=3\n\nAfter a4 (turn 4), y5=4\n\nAfter a5 (turn 5), y6=5\n\nAfter a6 (turn 6), y7=6\n\nAfter a7 (turn 7), y8=7\n\nAfter a8 (turn 8), y9=8\n\nAfter a9 (turn 9), y10=9\n\nSo after 7 actions, y=9 at turn 10.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I consider the position at turn t, after actions.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H=7, actions at turn 3 to 9.\n\nAll U.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collisions.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3 at later turns, but not reached.\n\nMaybe I should consider if I need to wait because of freeway 5 at T=8,9, but since I am not on it, fine.\n\nSuppose at some point I am on y=5 at T=8, it would be unsafe, but I avoid it.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=5 at T=6, which is fine.\n\nT=6 is turn 6, τ=3.\n\nT=8 is turn 8, τ=5.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7, with the sequence of actions consisting entirely of \"U\" (up) moves. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified below.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway Safety Summary**:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 are always safe for all turns \\(T \\geq 3\\).\n  - Freeway 3 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n  - Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n  - Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 3, 8, 9\\).\n\n- **Path Execution**:\n  - Turn 3: Player at \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2, safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_4 = 3\\).\n  - Turn 4: Player at \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3, safe at \\(T=4\\) as unsafe only at \\(T=12-14\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_5 = 4\\).\n  - Turn 5: Player at \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4, safe at \\(T=5\\) as unsafe only at \\(T=12-14\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_6 = 5\\).\n  - Turn 6: Player at \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5, safe at \\(T=6\\) as unsafe at \\(T=3,8,9\\) but not \\(T=6\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_7 = 6\\).\n  - Turn 7: Player at \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6, always safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_8 = 7\\).\n  - Turn 8: Player at \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7, always safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_9 = 8\\).\n  - Turn 9: Player at \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8, always safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_{10} = 9\\).\n  - Turn 10: Player at \\((0, 9)\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. Goal reached.\n\nThis path requires exactly 7 actions (from turn 3 to turn 9) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10, with no collisions. Since the vertical distance from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 7 units and each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\), 7 is the minimal number of actions (turns in the sequence).\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t1 = 4. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when moving, you're not on the new row until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t1=4, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with t1=4.\n\nDirection right: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -95, s=48, d=right\n\nSo at turn T, span = [-95 + 48(T-4), -48 + 48(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Let's see: (-48, -95, right, 48) — yes, identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nSo span at T: [-43 + 4(T-4), -32 + 4(T-4)] for right-moving.\n\nFreeway 4: (-32, -43, right, 4) — same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5 has multiple cars: (-24, -35, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nEach is separate, so I need to handle each car individually.\n\nFor each car, span at T: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, so [-35 + 6(T-4), -24 + 6(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, s=6, so [1 + 6(T-4), 12 + 6(T-4)]\n\nThird car: τ=37, h=48, s=6, so [37 + 6(T-4), 48 + 6(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -59, right, 4), (16, 5, right, 4) — direction is right for both.\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=4, so [-59 + 4(T-4), -48 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: τ=5, h=16, s=4? The table says (16,5,right,4), so head=16, tail=5? But for right-moving, head should be larger than tail? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so head > tail, and span is [tail, head].\n\nIn freeway 6, first car: (-48, -59, right, 4) — head=-48, tail=-59, since -48 > -59, so span [ -59, -48 ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16,5,right,4) — head=16, tail=5, so [5,16]\n\nAt turn T, for first car: [-59 + 4(T-4), -48 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: [5 + 4(T-4), 16 + 4(T-4)]\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, the update is: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the rule: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head is the front, which is decreasing, so h should be larger than τ? Let's see.\n\nIn this case, (-48, -25, left, 24), head=-48, tail=-25. Since it's left-moving, the car is moving left, so head should be to the left, meaning smaller x if x increases right? But in terms of position, x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nAt t1=4, span is [h, τ] = [-48, -25]? But -48 < -25, so [h, τ] with h=-48, τ=-25, which is from -48 to -25, so it's from left to right? But direction is left, meaning it's moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nThe span [h, τ] with h=-48, τ=-25, so left end is h=-48, right end is τ=-25. Since moving left, both decrease.\n\nAt T, span = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nNow, the player is at y=3 at turn t1=4. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, so at y=0, cannot go down, at y=9, cannot go up, but since we're going to 9, we can stop when we reach.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway y at turn T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for any car on that row.\n\nAlso, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. During turn T, you are on y_T, so collision check is only for row y_T at time T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check then.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo, collision only happens if at turn T, you are on row y, and for row y, 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nIf you move to a different row, you only occupy the new row starting from the next turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence to get from y=3 to y=9 as fast as possible, avoiding being on a row when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, we need to go up at least 6 times. Each U action increases y by 1, S or D would not help or delay, so minimal H should be 6 if we can go up every turn without collision. But we have to check for each row and turn whether it's safe to be there.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for the actions, starting from turn t1.\n\nt1 is given as 4, and actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H turns, position at turn t1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nThe position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision at turn t depends on y_t.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t1 + H} = 9, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the indices.\n\nGiven: at turn t1=4, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,3)\n\nWe take actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1} for H turns.\n\nThen after H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, position updates to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, take a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H} = 9, we start from y_{t1} = 3.\n\nAfter H actions, from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSince each action changes y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nTo increase y from 3 to 9, we need net +6, so at least 6 U actions, and H at least 6.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so for H actions, we go from turn t1 to t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, we are at y_{t1}=3.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1}, at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need to avoid collision at each turn t from t1 to t1+H-1, since at each turn t, we are at y_t, and we must not have collision on row y_t at time t.\n\nAt turn t, when we are at y_t, we check for row y_t at time t.\n\nThen we take action to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nNow, for the minimal H, since we need +6 in y, H must be at least 6, and we can achieve H=6 if we can go up every turn without collision on the rows we are on at each turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, which would increase H.\n\nFirst, let's see if H=6 is possible.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn t=4.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t=4+H.\n\nIf H=6, we reach at turn 10.\n\nNow, for each turn from t=4 to t=9 (since at turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action, but collision is checked at each turn we occupy a row.\n\nFrom turn t=4 to t=9, we are at some y each turn, and we need that for that y and t, no car on that row has 0 in span.\n\nThen at turn t=10, we are at y=9, and we don't take action or need to check? At turn t=10, if we are at y=9, we are done, and no action needed, so we don't occupy any row after that for collision, I think.\n\nThe collision is only checked when we are on a row during the turns we are moving.\n\nSpecifically, for turns when we are on a freeway row, we need to avoid collision.\n\nAt the start, turn t=4, we are at y=3, which is a freeway row? y=3 is freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\" and collision only for cars on freeways, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nBut at y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, we start at (0,3) at t=4, y=3 is freeway, so we need to check for collision at t=4 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, when we reach y=9, it's safe.\n\nFor minimal path, we should go directly up if possible.\n\nSo let's check for each row from y=3 to y=8, whether at the time we are there, it is safe.\n\nBut the time depends on when we arrive.\n\nSince we need to minimize H, we should move up as fast as possible unless blocked.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, for which turns it is unsafe, i.e., there is a car with 0 in span at that turn.\n\nThen for a path, we need that at each turn, if we are on a freeway row, it is safe at that turn.\n\nSince we can stay or move, we have choices.\n\nBut to min H, we prefer moving up.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway, when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car, right-moving, span at T: [-95 + 48(T-4), -48 + 48(T-4)]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -95 + 48(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(T-4)\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-95 + 48(T-4) <= 0  => 48(T-4) <= 95 => T-4 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T-4 <= 1 since T integer, T <= 5\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 48(T-4) => 48(T-4) >= 48 => T-4 >=1 => T >= 5\n\nSo both: T-4 >=1 and T-4 <=1.979, so T-4=1, T=5\n\nThus on freeway 1, unsafe only at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since identical, so unsafe only at T=5.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCar: (-32,-43,right,4), so span at T: [-43 + 4(T-4), -32 + 4(T-4)]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-43 + 4(T-4) <= 0 <= -32 + 4(T-4)\n\nFirst: -43 + 4(T-4) <= 0 => 4(T-4) <= 43 => T-4 <= 43/4 = 10.75, so T <= 14.75, always true for reasonable T? But we need to check both.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32 + 4(T-4) => 4(T-4) >= 32 => T-4 >= 8 => T >= 12\n\nAnd first inequality: -43 + 4(T-4) <= 0 => 4(T-4) <= 43 => T-4 <= 10.75, so T <= 14.75, so T <=14 since integer.\n\nSo both: T >=12 and T <=14\n\nThus unsafe for T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nMultiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6), span at T: [-35 + 6(T-4), -24 + 6(T-4)]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 6(T-4) <= 0 <= -24 + 6(T-4)\n\nFirst: -35 + 6(T-4) <= 0 => 6(T-4) <= 35 => T-4 <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, T <= 9.833, so T<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6(T-4) => 6(T-4) >= 24 => T-4 >=4 => T>=8\n\nSo both: T>=8 and T<=9, unsafe T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), span [1 + 6(T-4), 12 + 6(T-4)]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6(T-4) <= 0 <= 12 + 6(T-4)\n\nBut 1 + 6(T-4) is at least 1 when T=4, which is positive, and increases, so min is always positive for T>=4, so 0 <= min only if min <=0, but min =1 +6(T-4) >=1 >0, so 0 < min, thus 0 not <= min, so 0 not in span. Similarly, max is larger, but since min>0, 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSimilarly, third car: (48,37,right,6), span [37 +6(T-4), 48 +6(T-4)] min at least 37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car on freeway 5 can have 0 in span, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nThus freeway 5 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: first (-48,-59,right,4), span [-59 +4(T-4), -48 +4(T-4)]\n\n0 in span: -59 +4(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 +4(T-4)\n\nFirst: -59 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=59 => T-4 <=59/4=14.75, T<=18.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +4(T-4) => 4(T-4) >=48 => T-4 >=12 => T>=16\n\nBoth: T>=16 and T<=18.75, so T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4), span [5 +4(T-4), 16 +4(T-4)]\n\nmin =5 +4(T-4) >=5>0 for T>=4, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car, unsafe T=16,17,18\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCar: left-moving, (-48,-25,left,24)\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\nSince left-moving, span is [left, right] decreasing.\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, but min and max depend.\n\nSince moving left, the span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with h=-48, τ=-25, s=24, t1=4\n\nSo span = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\nNow, -48 -24(T-4) is the left end, -25 -24(T-4) is the right end.\n\nSince the car is moving left, left end decreases, right end decreases.\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, so:\n\n-48 -24(T-4) <= 0 and 0 <= -25 -24(T-4)\n\nFirst inequality: -48 -24(T-4) <= 0 => -24(T-4) <= 48 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 24(T-4) >= -48? No\n\n-48 -24(T-4) <= 0 => -24(T-4) <= 48\n\nDivide both sides by -24, reverse inequality: (T-4) >= -2\n\nSince 48 / -24 = -2, so T-4 >= -2, which is true for T>=2, always true in our case.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -24(T-4) => 0 <= -25 -24(T-4)\n\nBut -25 -24(T-4) is negative for T>=4, since -25 - something non-positive, so 0 <= negative number? False.\n\n0 <= -25 -24(T-4) => since right side is <= -25 <0, so 0 <= negative is false.\n\nThus, 0 is never in the span for this car? That can't be right.\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe span is [left, right] = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\nAt T=4, span = [-48, -25], so from -48 to -25, all negative, so 0 not in span.\n\nAs T increases, both ends decrease, so the span moves left, always negative, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for T=5, span = [-48-24(1), -25-24(1)] = [-72, -49], still negative.\n\nAlways negative, so indeed, 0 never in span for freeway 7.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nDirection left, moving left, so positions decreasing.\n\nAt t1=4, head -48, tail -25, so the car is from x=-48 to x=-25, with head at left, since moving left.\n\nAs time increases, both positions decrease, so the span is always left of x=0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nSo freeway 7 and 8 are always safe? No cars cover x=0 at any time.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, car (-48,-25,left,24), span always negative, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=5\n\n- y=2: no car? Freeways given: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=2: not listed in the table? The table has freeway k from 1 to 8, but for y=2, is there a car?\n\nLook back: \"Car State\" table:\n\nFreeway k: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nFor k=2: (-48,-95,right,48) — same as k=1.\n\nk=1 and k=2 both have cars.\n\nBut for y=2, is it listed? Freeway k=2 corresponds to y=2, I assume.\n\nThe freeway is the row, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, it lists the cars.\n\nFor freeway 2: it has cars, (-48,-95,right,48), same as freeway 1.\n\nBut earlier for y=1, we have unsafe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, same car configuration, so also unsafe only at T=5.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, so y=2 unsafe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: freeway 3, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same as 3, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe T=8,9\n\ny=6: freeway 6, unsafe T=16,17,18\n\ny=7: freeway 7, always safe\n\ny=8: freeway 8, always safe\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at turn t=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn t=4, we are at y=3. Is it safe? y=3 unsafe at T=12,13,14, but t=4 not in that, so at t=4, y=3 is safe? Let's check.\n\nFor y=3, unsafe only at T=12,13,14. At T=4, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can consider moving.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nStart at t=4, y=3.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nTurn t=4: at y=3, safe (since T=4 not 12-14)\n\nAction a_{t1} = a_4 = U, then at t=5, y=4\n\nNow turn t=5: at y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe at T=12,13,14; t=5 not, so safe. Action a_5=U, to y=5 at t=6\n\nTurn t=6: at y=5, unsafe at T=8,9; t=6 not, so safe. Action a_6=U, to y=6 at t=7\n\nTurn t=7: at y=6, unsafe at T=16,17,18; t=7 not, so safe. Action a_7=U, to y=7 at t=8\n\nNow turn t=8: at y=7, which is always safe, as we saw. Action a_8=U, to y=8 at t=9\n\nTurn t=9: at y=8, always safe. Action a_9=U, to y=9 at t=10\n\nNow at t=10, y=9, which is safe, and we are done.\n\nBut we need to check for collision at each turn we are on a freeway.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\n- t=4: y=3, safe (T=4 not unsafe)\n\n- t=5: y=4, safe (T=5 not unsafe for y=4; y=4 unsafe at T=12-14, t=5 not)\n\n- t=6: y=5, safe (T=6 not 8 or 9)\n\n- t=7: y=6, safe (T=7 not 16-18)\n\n- t=8: y=7, safe\n\n- t=9: y=8, safe\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, no need for action or collision check.\n\nWe took actions from t=4 to t=9, that's 6 actions: a4 to a9, and reached at t=10.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think, from t1 to t1+H-1 for actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nt1=4, actions a4 to a_{4+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nHere, after 6 actions, at turn 10, y=10? No.\n\nStart: turn t=4, position y=3\n\nAfter a4, at t=5, y=4\n\nAfter a5, at t=6, y=5\n\nAfter a6, at t=7, y=6\n\nAfter a7, at t=8, y=7\n\nAfter a8, at t=9, y=8\n\nAfter a9, at t=10, y=9\n\nSo actions a4 to a9, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at t=10.\n\nNow, in this sequence, at each turn t=4 to t=9, we were on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 respectively, and all were safe at those times.\n\nt=4: y=3, T=4 not unsafe\n\nt=5: y=4, T=5 not unsafe for y=4 (unsafe only at 12-14)\n\nt=6: y=5, T=6 not 8 or 9\n\nt=7: y=6, T=7 not 16-18\n\nt=8: y=7, always safe\n\nt=9: y=8, always safe\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut is there any issue? What about y=1 and y=2? We didn't go there, so no problem.\n\nAnd we reached in 6 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=1 and y=2 unsafe at T=5, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=4 at t=5, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe, but we are on y=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nSo with H=6, it is possible.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nt1=4, so actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = a4 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a5 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to a9 = U\n\nSince we did all U.\n\nNow, the sequence should be from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in terms of turns.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=6, so turns 4,5,6,7,8,9 with actions U each.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision at the points.\n\nFor example, at t=8, we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, always safe.\n\nSimilarly t=9, y=8 safe.\n\nIs there any car that might cover at other times?\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at y=5, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nBut at t=6, we were on y=5, T=6, not unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at T=16,17,18, we were on y=6 at t=7, not unsafe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut we start at y=3 at t=4, which is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what about the cars on y=3? At t=4, is there a car with 0 in span?\n\nFor y=3, freeway 3, car span at T=4: [-43 +4(0), -32 +4(0)] since T-4=0, [-43,-32], all negative, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo H=6 is achievable with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case 6.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let me see if we can go faster? To go from y=3 to y=9, we need 6 steps up, each takes one turn, so minimum 6 actions, H=6.\n\nWe cannot go faster.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used 6 actions over 6 turns to move up 6 times.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but no, from start position, we need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 U actions, each taking one turn, so minimum H=6.\n\nIf we do S or D, it would take more turns, so H>6, worse.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6 with all U actions.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nt1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=6, and actions from t=4 to t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t1+0}=a4, t=1, a5, ..., t=5, a9.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut in the box, we write the turns explicitly.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as per format.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nWith one line per turn.\n\nBut in this case, all U.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=9, we are at y=8, take U to go to y=9 at t=10.\n\ny=9 is safe, and we don't need to be on freeway at t=10 for action, since we reached.\n\nThe collision is only during the movement turns when on freeway.\n\nAt t=10, if we are at y=9, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But no, because to go from y=3 to y=9, we need 6 increments.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=3, after 5 U actions, we would be at y=8 at turn t=9, then need one more to y=9 at t=10.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nSuppose we do something else, but it would take same or more turns.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times, especially for the rows we used.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At t=4, y=3: unsafe at T=12,13,14; t=4 not, safe.\n\n- At t=5, y=4: unsafe at T=12,13,14; t=5 not, safe.\n\n- At t=6, y=5: unsafe at T=8,9; t=6 not, safe.\n\n- At t=7, y=6: unsafe at T=16,17,18; t=7 not, safe.\n\n- At t=8, y=7: always safe.\n\n- At t=9, y=8: always safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWhat about other rows? For example, at t=5, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 4 to turn 9, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn 4 (\\(y=3\\))**: Freeway 3 is unsafe at turns 12, 13, and 14. Turn 4 is safe.\n- **At turn 5 (\\(y=4\\))**: Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns 12, 13, and 14. Turn 5 is safe.\n- **At turn 6 (\\(y=5\\))**: Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns 8 and 9. Turn 6 is safe.\n- **At turn 7 (\\(y=6\\))**: Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 16, 17, and 18. Turn 7 is safe.\n- **At turn 8 (\\(y=7\\))**: Freeway 7 is always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\) at any turn).\n- **At turn 9 (\\(y=8\\))**: Freeway 8 is always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\) at any turn).\n\nSince all actions are U, the player moves up one row each turn, avoiding all collisions and reaching \\(y=9\\) in the minimum number of turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 4\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 6 - 1 = 9\\) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

Cars move left or right with given speeds, and I collide only if I'm on the same freeway at the same turn and the car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. That means I don't get hit by cars on y+1 at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=5, since that's the current state.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: car with head 0, tail -47, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, span at t=5 is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Direction right means head is greater, so tail is smaller. Head is 0, tail is -47, so span is [tail, head] = [-47, 0] for right-moving? Let me check the update rule.\n\nThe update says for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSince direction is right, head should be the right end, so at time T, position increases with time.\n\nAt turn t=5, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? But head is 0, tail is -47, so if right-moving, head is the front, so the car spans from tail to head, which is from -47 to 0.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it decreases.\n\nIn collision, we care about when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, the freeway is fixed for each car; each car is on a specific freeway.\n\nNow for freeway 1: at t=5, span = [τ, h] = [-47, 0] for right-moving? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right, head is the larger one, I think.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, so at t=5, τ=-47, h=0, so span = [-47, 0].\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-5), h + s(T-5)] = [-47 + 48(T-5), 0 + 48(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's list all cars at t=5:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span [-47, 0], right, speed 48\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? Head 0, tail -47, right, speed 48. So identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: head -28, tail -39, right, speed 4. So span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? Tail τ=-39, head h=-28, so since right-moving, span = [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [ -39 + 4(T-5), -28 + 4(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 4: similar, head -28, tail -39, right, speed 4, so same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFirst car: head -18, tail -29, right, speed 6 → span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nSecond car: head 18, tail 7, right, speed 6 → span [7, 18]? Tail τ=7, head h=18, so [7,18]\n\nThird car: head 54, tail 43, right, speed 6 → span [43,54]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars\n\nFirst: head -44, tail -55, right, speed 4 → span [ -55, -44 ]? Tail τ=-55, head h=-44, so [ -55, -44 ]\n\nSecond: head 20, tail 9, right, speed 4 → span [9,20]\n\nFreeway 7: head -72, tail -49, left, speed 24\n\nFor left-moving, the update is different. Left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd in the car state, it says head h, tail τ, but for left-moving, head might be the left end? Let's see.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 7: head h=-72, tail τ=-49, direction left, speed 24.\n\nFor left-moving, the car moves left, so head is the front, which is smaller x, I think.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd it says head at h, tail at τ, so for left-moving, since it moves left, head should be the left end, so h < τ probably.\n\nHere h=-72, τ=-49, so h < τ, since -72 < -49.\n\nSo at t=5, span = [h, τ] = [-72, -49]\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [ -72 - 24(T-5), -49 - 24(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same, head -72, tail -49, left, speed 24.\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span for each freeway, so I can avoid being on that freeway at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all on that freeway.\n\nBut for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is in the span for any car on it.\n\nThen for each turn, for each freeway, I can see if it's occupied at x=0.\n\nx=0 is the player's path; the player is always at x=0, moving vertically.\n\nSo for each freeway y, and time t, if there is a car on y such that 0 is in span(t), then it's occupied.\n\nI need to be on a freeway only when it's not occupied at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars, but I start at y=4, need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are probably safe, no cars.\n\nIn the position, player at (0,y), and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=5, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y bounded to 0-9, so at y=0, D or S keeps at 0, similarly at y=9, U or S keeps at 9.\n\nBut since I need to reach exactly y=9, and minimize turns, probably I should go up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it's occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time t.\n\nTime t is turn number.\n\nCurrent turn t=5.\n\nLet t be absolute turn, so t=5 now.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span at t: [ -47 + 48(t-5), 0 + 48(t-5) ] = [48(t-5) -47, 48(t-5)]\n\n0 is in span if 48(t-5) -47 <= 0 <= 48(t-5)\n\nSo 48(t-5) -47 <= 0 and 0 <= 48(t-5)\n\nFrom 0 <= 48(t-5), so t-5 >= 0, so t >=5\n\nFrom 48(t-5) -47 <= 0, so 48(t-5) <= 47, so t-5 <= 47/48 <1, so t-5 =0, since t integer.\n\nt-5 <= 47/48 <1, so t-5 =0, t=5.\n\nAt t=5, 48(0) -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, yes 0 in [-47,0].\n\nFor t>5, say t=6, span [48(1)-47, 48(1)] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly t<5, but we start at t=5, so only at t=5, freeway 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nAt t=5, span is [ -47,0 ], so x=0 is included.\n\nFor t=6, [48-47,48]=[1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for later times.\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied only at t=5.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, head 0, tail -47, right, speed 48, so identical, occupied only at t=5.\n\nFreeway 3: car span at t: [ -39 + 4(t-5), -28 + 4(t-5) ]\n\n0 in span if -39 + 4(t-5) <= 0 <= -28 + 4(t-5)\n\nSo left: -39 + 4(t-5) <= 0 => 4(t-5) <= 39 => t-5 <= 39/4 = 9.75, so t-5 <= 9\n\nRight: 0 <= -28 + 4(t-5) => 28 <= 4(t-5) => 7 <= t-5, so t-5 >= 7\n\nThus t-5 >=7 and t-5 <=9, so t-5 =7,8,9\n\nThus t=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as 3, occupied at t=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at t: [ -29 + 6(t-5), -18 + 6(t-5) ]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 6(t-5) <= 0 <= -18 + 6(t-5)\n\nLeft: -29 + 6(t-5) <=0 => 6(t-5) <=29 => t-5 <= 29/6 ≈4.833, so t-5 <=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -18 + 6(t-5) => 18 <= 6(t-5) => 3 <= t-5, so t-5 >=3\n\nThus t-5 =3 or 4, so t=8 or 9\n\nSecond car: span at t: [7 + 6(t-5), 18 + 6(t-5)]\n\n0 in span? 7 + 6(t-5) <= 0 <= 18 + 6(t-5)\n\nBut 7 + 6(t-5) >=7 >0 for t>=5, so left end >0, so 0 never <= left end, so 0 not in span for all t. Since span starts at min 7 at t=5, increases.\n\nAt t=5, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nThird car: [43 + 6(t-5), 54 + 6(t-5)] always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only first car can have 0 in span, at t=8 and 9.\n\nt-5=3 or 4, t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 6.\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: head -44, tail -55, right, speed 4.\n\nSpan at t: [ -55 + 4(t-5), -44 + 4(t-5) ]\n\n0 in span if -55 + 4(t-5) <= 0 <= -44 + 4(t-5)\n\nLeft: -55 + 4(t-5) <=0 => 4(t-5) <=55 => t-5 <= 55/4=13.75, so t-5 <=13\n\nRight: 0 <= -44 + 4(t-5) => 44 <= 4(t-5) => 11 <= t-5, so t-5 >=11\n\nThus t-5 =11,12,13 → t=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: head 20, tail 9, right, speed 4.\n\nSpan [9 + 4(t-5), 20 + 4(t-5)]\n\n0 in span? 9 + 4(t-5) <=0 <=20 +4(t-5)\n\nBut 9 +4(t-5) >=9>0 for t>=5, so left end >0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car matters, freeway 6 occupied at t=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 7: left-moving car, head h=-72, tail τ=-49, direction left, speed 24.\n\nSpan at t: for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-72 -24(t-5), -49 -24(t-5)]\n\n0 in span if -72 -24(t-5) <= 0 <= -49 -24(t-5)\n\nNow, since left-moving, and decreasing, let's see.\n\nLeft inequality: -72 -24(t-5) <= 0 => -24(t-5) <= 72 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 24(t-5) >= -72, but since t>=5, t-5>=0, so always true? Let's carefully.\n\n-72 -24(t-5) <= 0\n\nAdd 72: -24(t-5) <= 72\n\nNow divide by -24, reverse inequality: (t-5) >= -72/24 = -3\n\nSince -72/24 = -3.\n\nSo t-5 >= -3, which is true for all t>=5, since t-5 >=0 > -3.\n\nNow right inequality: 0 <= -49 -24(t-5)\n\nSo 0 <= -49 -24(t-5)\n\nAdd 49: 49 <= -24(t-5)\n\nThen, since -24(t-5) is negative for t>5, but left is positive, so inequality: 49 <= -24(t-5)\n\nBut left positive, right negative for t>5? At t=5, -24(0)=0, so 49 <=0 false.\n\nFor t>5, -24(t-5) <0, so 49 <= negative number? Impossible.\n\n0 <= -49 -24(t-5) means -49 -24(t-5) >=0? No:\n\n0 <= A means A >=0.\n\nSo -49 -24(t-5) >=0\n\nThen -49 >= 24(t-5) ? Multiply both sides by -1, reverse: 49 <= -24(t-5)\n\nNow, since t>=5, t-5>=0, -24(t-5) <=0, so 49 <= something <=0, which is impossible since 49>0.\n\nThus, for all t, the right inequality is false, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same, since identical.\n\nSo freeway 7 and 8 are never occupied at x=0? Is that right?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAt t=5, span = [h, τ] = [-72, -49] for left-moving? Earlier: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], with h and τ, here h=-72, τ=-49, so [ -72, -49 ], which is from x=-72 to x=-49, so 0 not in, since -49 <0? -49 is less than 0, so -72 to -49, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt later t, span(T) = [ -72 -24(T-5), -49 -24(T-5) ], since moving left, both ends decrease, so span moves left, always negative, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nSo freeways 7 and 8 are always safe? No cars at x=0 ever.\n\nBut let me confirm the direction.\n\nFreeway 7: direction left, head h=-72, tail τ=-49.\n\nIn left-moving, head is the left end, I think, because it moves left.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd at t=5, [h, τ] = [-72, -49], so if h is head and left, then the car spans from x=-72 to x=-49, with x=-72 being the front.\n\nAs time increases, both decrease, so the car moves left, so x=0 is never covered.\n\nYes, so for freeway 7 and 8, no car ever at x=0.\n\nTherefore, freeways 7 and 8 are always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway 6 occupied at t=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 5 occupied at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3 occupied at t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2 occupied at t=5\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at t=5\n\nAnd freeways 7 and 8 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=5, y=4.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 4 is y=4? Freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt t=5, freeway 4 is not occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at t=12,13,14, not at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, which freeways are occupied?\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at t=5\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at t=5\n\nFreeway 3: not, only later\n\nFreeway 4: not\n\nFreeway 5: not at t=5, only at 8,9\n\nFreeway 6: not\n\nFreeway 7,8: never\n\nSo at t=5, only freeways 1 and 2 are occupied.\n\nBut I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, not occupied at t=5, so I am safe at t=5.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so at least 5 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's see the future unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nList the occupancy:\n\nFor each y and t, whether occupied at x=0.\n\ny=1: occupied only t=5\n\ny=2: occupied only t=5\n\ny=3: occupied t=12,13,14\n\ny=4: occupied t=12,13,14\n\ny=5: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=6: occupied t=16,17,18\n\ny=7: never occupied\n\ny=8: never occupied\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nI start at t=5, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nIf I go up directly: from y=4, at turn t=5, I am at y=4.\n\nThen I choose action for turn t=5, which affects y at t=6.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=5, position y=4.\n\nI choose action a_5, which will move to y_6 = y_5 + Δy, with Δy based on a_5.\n\nSimilarly, a_6 determines y_7, and so on.\n\nI need to be at position y_t for each turn t, and not be on a freeway that is occupied at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I collide if y_T is between 1 and 8 and occupied at T.\n\nNow, y_T is my vertical position at turn T.\n\nI start at turn T=5, y_5=4.\n\nI choose actions for t=5, t=6, ..., up to some H, such that at turn t=5 + (H-1), y_{5 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is turn t = 5 + (H-1), and at that turn I should be at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's safe.\n\nNow, minimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on occupied freeways at the wrong time.\n\nNow, the occupied times are:\n\ny=1: t=5 only\n\ny=2: t=5 only\n\ny=3: t=12,13,14\n\ny=4: t=12,13,14\n\ny=5: t=8,9\n\ny=6: t=16,17,18\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, I can stay there or move through them anytime.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous parts are y=5 at t=8,9 and y=3,4 at t=12,13,14, and y=6 at t=16,17,18.\n\nBut y=6 occupied at t=16,17,18, which is later, and since I want to go up fast, I might not reach there that late.\n\nFirst, if I go up directly from y=4 at t=5.\n\nStart t=5, y=4.\n\nI choose a_5: if I go up, then at t=6, y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at t=8,9, not at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=5: is it occupied? Freeway 5 occupied only at t=8,9, so at t=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, I can go up again, to y=7 at t=7? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn t=5: I am at y=4. I choose a_5, which sets y_6.\n\nThen at turn t=6, I am at y_6, and so on.\n\nSo for turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=5, y_5=4.\n\nIf I choose a_5 = U, then y_6 = y_5 +1 =5.\n\nThen at turn t=6, I am at y=5.\n\ny=5 at t=6: occupied? Freeway 5 occupied at t=8,9, not t=6, so safe.\n\nThen I can choose a_6 = U, so y_7 = y_6 +1 =6.\n\nAt turn t=7, y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=7: occupied? Freeway 6 occupied at t=16,17,18, not t=7, so safe.\n\nThen a_7 = U, y_8 =7.\n\nAt t=8, y=7.\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nThen a_8 = U, y_9 =8.\n\nAt t=9, y=8, always safe.\n\nThen a_9 = U, y_10 =9.\n\nAt turn t=10, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check for collision: we need to ensure at each turn, when on freeway, not occupied.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, occupied at t=12,13,14, not t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, occupied at t=8,9, not t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, occupied at t=16,17,18, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at turn t=10.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=5 to t=10, that's 6 turns? Let's see the actions.\n\nI started at t=5, y=4.\n\nAfter first action a_5, at t=6, y=5.\n\nAfter a_6, t=7, y=6.\n\nAfter a_7, t=8, y=7.\n\nAfter a_8, t=9, y=8.\n\nAfter a_9, t=10, y=9.\n\nSo I used actions at t=5,6,7,8,9, that's 5 actions, and reached at t=10 with y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nt_1 is 5, so actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and at turn t=5+H-1, y=9.\n\nHere, at turn t=10, y=9, so 5+H-1=10, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions: a_5 to a_9, that's 5 actions? Indices from t=5 to t=9, that's 5 turns of actions.\n\nSequence: t=5: action, t=6: action, ..., up to t=5+H-1 action.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=5+H, position y_{5+H}.\n\nSet y_{t} at turn t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position changes to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t=5, y_5=4.\n\nWe perform actions a_5, a_6, ..., a_{5+H-1} such that after H actions, y_{5+H} =9.\n\nAnd at each turn t from 5 to 5+H-1, when we are at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at t.\n\nIn this case, for the direct path:\n\nt=5: y=4, safe\n\nt=6: y=5, safe (since occupied only at 8,9)\n\nt=7: y=6, safe (occupied at 16-18)\n\nt=8: y=7, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, safe\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, reached, but at turn t=10, we don't need to check collision since y=9 not freeway, but the actions are up to a_9, which sets y_{10}=9.\n\nThe turns we are on freeway are t=5 to t=9, all safe as above.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied at t=5\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, not occupied at t=6 (only at 8,9)\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, not occupied at t=7 (only at 16-18)\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, always safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, always safe\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo with actions: a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, that's 5 actions, H=5? Let's see H.\n\nt_1 =5, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but absolute t.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nSo action at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=5, after H actions, at turn 5+H, y_{5+H}=9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 10, y=9, so 5+H=10, H=5.\n\nActions: for t=0 to 4, a_{5+t}\n\nt=0: a_5\n\nt=1: a_6\n\nt=2: a_7\n\nt=3: a_8\n\nt=4: a_9\n\nAll U.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 10.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=8 or 9? At t=8, I am at y=7, which is safe, and y=5 is occupied at t=8, but I am not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I am at y=8, safe.\n\ny=5 occupied at t=8 and 9, but I am not there.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=8, I am at y=7, not y=5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut what about going faster? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 steps up, so 5 actions, H=5 seems minimal.\n\nBut is it possible with less? No, because I need to increase y by 5, each U increases by 1, so at least 5 U actions.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns, so H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I might be forced to wait.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if I were on y=5, it would be occupied, but in this path, at t=8 I am at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\ny=6 occupied at t=16,17,18, but I am there at t=7, which is fine.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5, there is a car at t=8 and 9, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3 and 4 occupied at t=12,13,14, but I am long gone.\n\nSo with H=5, actions all U.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn t=5, position (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_5=U, at turn t=6, position y=5\n\nAfter a_6=U, turn t=7, y=6\n\nAfter a_7=U, turn t=8, y=7\n\nAfter a_8=U, turn t=9, y=8\n\nAfter a_9=U, turn t=10, y=9\n\nReached at turn t=10.\n\nNow, for the sequence: actions from t=5 to t=9.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut is there any issue I missed?\n\nIn freeway 5, at t=8, occupied, but I am at y=7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I am at y=8.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster, but no, 5 steps needed.\n\nMaybe with S or D, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5: at t=8, span is for first car.\n\nAt t=8, t-5=3, span [ -29 +6(3), -18 +6(3) ] = [ -29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0]\n\n-29 + 18 = -11, -18+18=0, so [ -11, 0], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, t-5=4, [ -29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut at t=8, I am at y=7, not on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe, as established.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and in this sequence, no collision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to output for H turns.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=5, I start at y=4, which is freeway 4, and it is safe, as not occupied.\n\nIn the action, I immediately go up.\n\nIs there a reason to stay or go down? No, since I want to go up.\n\nPerhaps at some point I need to avoid being on y=5 at t=8 or 9, but in this path, I am not.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=5, but at t=5, y=4 is safe, but if I stay, then at t=6, I am still at y=4.\n\nBut freeway 4 is occupied only at t=12,13,14, so at t=6, still safe, but I waste time.\n\nThen I can go up later, but H would be larger.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut what about y=3 and y=4 occupied at t=12,13,14, but I am not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 occupied at t=16,17,18, late.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go through y=7 and y=8 faster, but I am already going directly.\n\nSo I think H=5 with all U is correct.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\n}\n\nBut H=5, and actions from t=5 to t=9, that's 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=5, H=5, so actions at t=5 to t=5+4=9, yes.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=4, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 4: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for each turn, the action.\n\nIn this case, all U.\n\nBut is there a possibility that at some point I need to do something else?\n\nFor example, suppose at t=7, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at t=8, safe.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at t=8, but I am not there.\n\nSuppose I go slower: if I stay at y=4 for one turn.\n\nAt t=5, I choose S, then at t=6, y=4 still.\n\nThen at t=6, I go U, to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, which is freeway 5, and occupied? At t=7, freeway 5 not occupied, only at 8,9.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, freeway 6, not occupied at t=8 (only at 16-18), safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=9, then U to y=8 at t=10, U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nReached at t=11, with H=6 actions: S at t=5, U at t=6,7,8,9,10? Actions from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions, reached at t=11.\n\nWorse than H=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, even worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but avoid y=5 at some point, but in this case, I go through y=5 at t=6, which is safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=5 not occupied.\n\nOnly unsafe at t=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo I think the direct path is fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position over time for the direct path:\n\nt=5: y=4\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nt=8: y=7\n\nt=9: y=8\n\nt=10: y=9\n\nNow, freeway occupancy:\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4 not occ\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5 not occ (occ at 8,9)\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6 not occ (occ at 16-18)\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7 always safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8 always safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, I could, for example, go to y=7 earlier and stay, but that might not help.\n\nFor instance, from y=4 at t=5, if I go up twice quickly, but I already do.\n\nSuppose I go U at t=5 to y=5 at t=6, then at t=6, instead of U, I go U again to y=6 at t=7, same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps at t=7, I go S or something, but that would delay.\n\nNot useful.\n\nSo I think H=5 with all U is minimal and safe.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, there is a second car at [7,18] at t=5, but it doesn't cover 0, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, there is a car that might be problematic, but at t=16-18, late.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U for 5 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn t=5, position (0,4), and I take action a_5=U, moving to y=5 at next turn.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nSo for turn 5, action U, etc.\n\nNow, about the collision note: it says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span(T) but not span(T+1).\"\n\nIn this case, when I move, for example, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I am only on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn my sequence, no issue, since I move up each time, and at each turn, I am only on one freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn t=6, I am on y=5, which is freeway 5, and at that time, no car there, so safe.\n\nI don't have to worry about y=6 at that turn because I'm not on it yet.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the optimal sequence of actions is to move up (U) at every turn. This sequence requires 5 turns (\\(H = 5\\)) and ensures that the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10 without colliding with any cars.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t = 5\\))**: Player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is occupied at turns 12, 13, and 14, but not at turn 5. Thus, safe.\n- **Turn 6 (\\(t = 6\\))**: Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is occupied at turns 8 and 9, but not at turn 6. Thus, safe.\n- **Turn 7 (\\(t = 7\\))**: Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is occupied at turns 16, 17, and 18, but not at turn 7. Thus, safe.\n- **Turn 8 (\\(t = 8\\))**: Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is never occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (always safe).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 9\\))**: Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is never occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (always safe).\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t = 10\\))**: Player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThe sequence avoids all occupied freeways at critical times:\n- Freeway 1 and 2 are only occupied at turn 5, but the player is not on them.\n- Freeway 3 and 4 are occupied at turns 12–14, but the player has moved past them by turn 7.\n- Freeway 5 is occupied at turns 8–9, but the player is on it only at turn 6 (safe) and has moved away by turn 7.\n- Freeway 6 is occupied at turns 16–18, but the player is on it only at turn 7 (safe) and has moved away by turn 8.\n\n### Minimal Turns\nThe player starts at \\(y = 4\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a minimum of 5 upward moves. Any stay (S) or down (D) action would increase the number of turns, so \\(H = 5\\) is minimal. The sequence of all U actions achieves this without delays.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{5 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{4}\\) is:\n- At turn 5: action \\(a_5 = U\\)\n- At turn 6: action \\(a_6 = U\\)\n- At turn 7: action \\(a_7 = U\\)\n- At turn 8: action \\(a_8 = U\\)\n- At turn 9: action \\(a_9 = U\\)\n\nThis results in the player position reaching (0, 9) at turn 10.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from t=6.\n\nFirst, understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds. The collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So for the row I'm moving to, I only care about cars at turn T+1 when I arrive.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_start = 6.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,5).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so I have to go up to row 9. Since I start at 5, I need to go up 4 rows: to 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars on rows 1-8 when I'm on those rows.\n\nRows are from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so row 0 and 9 have no cars, so no collision there. But I start on row 5, which has cars, and I need to be on row 9, which is safe.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), and since row 9 has no freeway, no cars, so as long as I reach there, it's fine. But during the journey, I need to avoid collisions on rows 1-8.\n\nNow, the car positions at turn t=6 are given, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me list all cars per row with their positions at t=6.\n\nFreeway k means row k, I think. Yes, freeway y=k for k=1 to 8.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: one car: head 48, tail 1, direction right, speed 48. Since direction right, span is [τ, h] = [1,48] at t=6.\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving: span is [tail, head], I think? Let me check.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span [h, τ] -> [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nRight-moving: span [τ, h] -> [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor row 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, at t=6, the car is from τ=1 to h=48, so positions from 1 to 48 inclusive? But it's a span, so continuous, but since we care about integer positions? The collision is if 0 is in the span, but 0 is a specific point, x=0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I think? Player position is given as (0, y_t), so always at column 0, and row y_t.\n\nCars are on the rows, and span is horizontal, I assume, so for each row, cars occupy a range of columns.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on row y_T, and for that row, there is a car where 0 (the column) is within its span at that turn.\n\nSo we care about whether column 0 is covered by any car on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, for row 1 at t=6: car with tail τ=1, head h=48, right-moving, speed 48.\n\nSince right-moving, at time t, position: the front is moving right, so head increases.\n\nAt t=6, span is [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nAs time increases, for right-moving, τ + s Δt, h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, h - s Δt, τ - s Δt.\n\nNow, we care about when column 0 is in the span for a given row and turn.\n\nAlso, the span might be large, and we need to see if 0 is between the min and max of the span.\n\nFor row 1: car at t=6: [1,48], right, s=48.\n\nSo at time T, span is [1 + 48(T-6), 48 + 48(T-6)] = [48(T-6) +1, 48(T-6) +48]\n\nSimplify: let Δt = T - t_start = T - 6\n\nThen for row 1 car: span at T: [48 Δt +1, 48 Δt +48]\n\n0 is in this span if 48 Δt +1 ≤ 0 ≤ 48 Δt +48\n\nBut 48 Δt +1 ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so 0 ≤ 48 Δt +48 is always true for Δt≥0, but 0 ≥ 48 Δt +1? 48 Δt +1 ≥1 >0, so 0 < 48 Δt +1 ≤ something, so 0 is never in [48 Δt +1, 48 Δt +48] because the left end is at least 1, greater than 0. So for row 1, at all times T≥6, the car is to the right of 0, since min position is 48 Δt +1 ≥1 >0, so column 0 is never occupied on row 1 for T≥6. So row 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nMin position: at T=6, min=1>0, and as Δt increases, min increases, so always min >0, so 0 not in span. Yes, so row 1 is safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: same as row 1, (48,1,right,48), so identical, always min position >=1>0, so row 2 also always safe.\n\nNow row 3: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nDirection right, so span at t=6 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? Head and tail: given as (head h, tail τ) = (-24, -35), direction right.\n\nSince right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at t=6.\n\nThen at time T, since right-moving, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 4 Δt, -24 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 is in span if -35 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 4 Δt\n\nWhich is -35 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 35 => Δt ≤ 35/4 = 8.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -24 + 4 Δt => 24 ≤ 4 Δt => Δt ≥ 6\n\nSo for Δt from 6 to 8.75, since Δt integer, Δt=6,7,8\n\nAt Δt=6: T=6+6=12, span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-35 +4*6 = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included? The span is inclusive? I think so, since it's a closed interval.\n\nIn the collision, it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is the endpoint, it is included.\n\nAt T=12, span [ -11, 0], so 0 is in it, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=7: T=13, span [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=8: T=14, span [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=9: T=15, span [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for row 3, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow row 4: similar, (-24,-35,right,4), same as row 3, so collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow row 5: multiple cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (head=-12, tail=-23, right, s=6)\n\nAt t=6, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12] for right-moving.\n\nAt T, span [-23 +6 Δt, -12 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23+6Δt ≤0 ≤ -12+6Δt\n\nSo -23+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤23 => Δt ≤ 23/6 ≈3.833\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -12+6Δt => 12≤6Δt => Δt ≥2\n\nSo Δt=2,3\n\nAt Δt=2, T=8, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=3, T=9, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=4, T=10, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13? Direction right, so span at t=6 [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13+6Δt, 24+6Δt], min=13+6Δt ≥13>0 for Δt≥0, so always min>0, 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,6), head=60, tail=49, span [49,60] at t=6, min=49>0, always safe.\n\nSo for row 5, only the first car causes collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow row 6: cars: (-40,-51,right,4), and (24,13,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-40, tail=-51, right, s=4\n\nAt t=6, span [τ, h] = [-51,-40]\n\nAt T, [-51 +4Δt, -40 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -51+4Δt ≤0 ≤ -40+4Δt\n\nSo -51+4Δt ≤0 => 4Δt ≤51 => Δt ≤ 12.75\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -40+4Δt => 40≤4Δt => Δt ≥10\n\nSo Δt=10,11,12\n\nT=16,17,18\n\nAt Δt=10, T=16, span [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=11, T=17, [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=12, T=18, [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=13, T=19, [-51+52, -40+52] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4), span at t=6 [13,24], min=13>0, always safe.\n\nSo row 6 collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow row 7: (48,71,left,24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] at t=6? Given (head h, tail τ) = (48,71), but direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, the update: span [h, τ] -> [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nAnd in the initial, it's given as head and tail, but for left-moving, head is the front, which is left, so at t=6, span [h, τ] = [48,71]? But 48 to 71, that seems increasing, but direction left, meaning moving left, so head should be smaller? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ], and since moving left, h decreases over time.\n\nFor row 7: (48,71,left,24), direction left.\n\nSo at t=6, span [h, τ] = [48,71]\n\nBut 48 to 71, if moving left, the head should be on the left, so smaller x, but 48<71, so [48,71] means from 48 to 71, which is rightward, but moving left? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined relative to direction.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, span [h, τ] with h and τ such that moving left decreases both.\n\nAt t=6, [48,71], but 48<71, so if moving left, at later time, both decrease, so span moves left.\n\nBut column 0 is at left, so we care about when 0 is covered.\n\nAt t=6, [48,71], min=48>0, so not covering 0.\n\nAt time T, span [48 - 24 Δt, 71 - 24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 71 - 24 Δt\n\nFirst: 48 - 24 Δt ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 24 Δt => Δt ≥ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 71 - 24 Δt => 24 Δt ≤ 71 => Δt ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSo Δt=2 and Δt=3? Δt integer.\n\nΔt ≥2 and Δt ≤ 2.958, so Δt=2? Let's see:\n\nAt Δt=2: T=8, span [48-48, 71-48] = [0,23], 0 is in, since [0,23] includes 0.\n\nAt Δt=3: T=9, span [48-72, 71-72] = [-24,-1], min=-24<0, max=-1<0, so 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1: T=7, span [48-24, 71-24] = [24,47], min=24>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=8, collision on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: same as row 7, (48,71,left,24), so collision only at T=8.\n\nNow, summarize the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: always safe (as we saw)\n\nRow 2: always safe\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=8\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=8\n\nNow, the player starts at t=6, position row 5.\n\nI need to go to row 9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny in [0,9], so I can go down to 0 or up to 9.\n\nBut since I need to go to 9, down might not help, but perhaps to avoid cars, I need to stay or go down temporarily.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns: since I need to go from row 5 to row 9, that's 4 steps up, so at least 4 turns if I go up continuously. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change row at the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on row y_T. I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{T+1} = y_T +1\n\nD, y_{T+1} = y_T -1\n\nS, y_{T+1} = y_T\n\nCollision at turn T only if I am on row y_T, and that row has a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nWhen I move to a new row, I arrive at turn T+1 if I moved at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: suppose at turn T, I am on row y.\n\n- If I do S, I stay on row y at turn T+1.\n\n- If I do U, I move to row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\n- If I do D, I move to row y-1 at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y, and I might have collision if row y is unsafe at T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, I am on the new row.\n\nNow, for the row I am moving to, I need to ensure that when I arrive, it is safe.\n\nFor example, if I move to row y+1 at turn T+1, I need row y+1 to be safe at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I need row y safe at turn T+1.\n\nNow, in this case, I start at t=6, row 5.\n\nRow 5 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=6 is current, I am on row 5 at t=6.\n\nIs row 5 safe at t=6?\n\nAt t=6, row 5 cars: we have the first car with span [-23,-12] at t=6, which is negative, so min=-23<0, max=-12<0? [-23,-12], both negative, so 0 not in, since 0 > -12? -12 is negative, so 0 > max, so not in span.\n\nSecond and third cars are positive, so row 5 at t=6: no car covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows at t=6: we can check, but since I start there, and no issue.\n\nNow, I need to leave row 5 or stay, but row 5 will be unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are future turns.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have unsafe times.\n\nSince I need to go to row 9, and rows 0 and 9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nI can go directly up, but let's see the path.\n\nOption 1: go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=6, row 5.\n\nI can do U at t=6: then at t=7, I am on row 6.\n\nThen at t=7, I can do U: at t=8, row 7.\n\nThen U at t=8: at t=9, row 8.\n\nThen U at t=9: at t=10, row 9. Done in 4 turns: actions at t=6,7,8,9 to U, reach row 9 at t=10.\n\nBut need to check for collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row, it must be safe.\n\nt=6: row 5, safe as above.\n\nt=7: I am on row 6. Is row 6 safe at t=7?\n\nRow 6 unsafe at T=16,17,18. t=7 is early, so should be safe.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=1 from start, row 6 cars: first car span [-51 +4*1, -40 +4*1] = [-47,-36] at T=7, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [13+4*1,24+4*1]=[17,28]>0, safe. So row 6 safe at t=7.\n\nt=8: I am on row 7. Row 7 unsafe at t=8? Yes, from above, row 7 has collision at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on row 7, collision!\n\nIn this path: at t=8, after action at t=7 (U), I am on row 7 at turn t=8.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on row 7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 also unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo this direct path has problem at t=8.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at t=8.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down at some point.\n\nSince row 5 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I need to leave row 5 before t=8 or after t=9, but after t=9 might take more time.\n\nt=8 and t=9 row 5 unsafe, so at t=8 and t=9, I should not be on row 5.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times again:\n\nRow 1: always safe\n\nRow 2: always safe\n\nRow 3: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nRow 4: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nRow 5: unsafe t=8,9\n\nRow 6: unsafe t=16,17,18\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=8\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=8\n\nt=8 is a critical point: rows 5,7,8 are all unsafe at t=8.\n\nRow 5 at t=8 and t=9, row 7 and 8 only at t=8.\n\nRow 6 is safe at t=8? Row 6 unsafe only at t=16,17,18, so at t=8, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4,3, etc.\n\nAt t=8, which rows are safe?\n\nRow 1: safe\n\nRow 2: safe\n\nRow 3: safe at t=8 (unsafe only later)\n\nRow 4: safe at t=8 (unsafe t=12-14)\n\nRow 5: unsafe\n\nRow 6: safe\n\nRow 7: unsafe\n\nRow 8: unsafe\n\nRow 0 and 9 always safe, but row 0 is below.\n\nSo at t=8, safe rows are 0,1,2,3,4,6,9? But row 9 is the goal, not where I am yet.\n\nI need to be on a row that is safe at that turn.\n\nSince I start at row 5, t=6.\n\nI need to reach row 9.\n\nMinimal H, so I should go up, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=8, I can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 unsafe t=8,9.\n\nOne idea: at t=6, instead of going up, I go down to row 4 or something to wait, but row 4 might have issues later.\n\nSince t=8 is bad for rows 5,7,8, I can be on row 6 at t=8, which is safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo possible plan:\n\nAt t=6, I am on row 5. Instead of going up, I go down to row 4? Or stay? But row 5 will be unsafe at t=8,9, so I need to leave before or after.\n\nIf I go down, I go to row 4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I can be on row 4.\n\nRow 4 at t=7: is it safe? Row 4 unsafe only at t=12,13,14, so at t=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I need to decide action.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince row 6 is safe at t=8, I can be on row 6 at t=8.\n\nStart: t=6, row 5.\n\nIf I do S at t=6, then at t=7, still row 5.\n\nBut row 5 at t=7: is it safe? Earlier we have row 5 unsafe at t=8,9, not t=7.\n\nAt t=7, row 5: Δt=1, from row 5 cars, first car span [-23 +6*1, -12 +6*1] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in. Other cars safe, so row 5 safe at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 safe, t=7 safe, t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=6, I can do S: stay on row 5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I need to move. If I do U, to row 6 at t=8.\n\nNow, at t=8, I am on row 6, which is safe, as we said.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at t=8, but at t=8 I am on row 6, not row 7.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on row 6, I can do U to go to row 7 at t=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, I am on row 7.\n\nIs row 7 safe at t=9?\n\nRow 7 unsafe only at t=8, so at t=9, should be safe.\n\nAt t=9, row 7: Δt=3 from start, span [48 -24*3, 71 -24*3] = [48-72, 71-72] = [-24,-1], min=-24<0, max=-1<0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=9: same as row 7, but row 8 car: (48,71,left,24), at t=9, span [48-72,71-72]=[-24,-1], safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nt=6: start row 5, safe.\n\nAction at t=6: let's say I do S, so at t=7, row 5.\n\nt=7: row 5 safe, as above.\n\nAction at t=7: I do U, so at t=8, row 6.\n\nt=8: row 6 safe, as row 6 unsafe only later.\n\nAction at t=8: do U, to row 7 at t=9.\n\nt=9: row 7 safe, as above.\n\nAction at t=9: do U, to row 8 at t=10.\n\nt=10: I am on row 8.\n\nIs row 8 safe at t=10?\n\nRow 8 unsafe only at t=8, at t=10, Δt=4, span [48 -24*4, 71-24*4] = [48-96, 71-96] = [-48,-25], both negative, safe.\n\nAction at t=10: do U, to row 9 at t=11.\n\nNow at t=11, I am on row 9, which is safe, goal reached.\n\nBut I started at t=6, actions from t=6 to t=10, that's 5 actions: t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSequence: t=6: S, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U, reach row 9 at t=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? I used 5 turns to go from 5 to 9, but since I stayed one turn, it took 5 actions.\n\nCan I do with 4 actions?\n\nFor example, if I go up directly, but earlier it failed because of t=8 on row 7.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 6 earlier.\n\nStart t=6, row 5.\n\nAction U at t=6: to row 6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: on row 6, safe.\n\nNow, at t=7, if I do U, to row 7 at t=8.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nIf I do S at t=7, stay on row 6 at t=8.\n\nt=8: row 6 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, do U to row 7 at t=9.\n\nt=9: row 7 safe.\n\nThen U at t=9 to row 8 at t=10.\n\nThen U at t=10 to row 9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before: actions: t=6: U, t=7: S, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U, reach at t=11, 5 actions.\n\nStill 5.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=6, I go U to row 6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, instead of S, I go U to row 7 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nGo down? But going down might not help.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a lower row to avoid, but that might take more time.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=8, I can be on row 7 at t=7 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nBut to reach row 9, I need to pass through 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, I can be on row 7 at t=7 or t=9.\n\nt=7: row 7 safe? At t=7, Δt=1, row 7 span [48-24,71-24]=[24,47], min=24>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 same.\n\nNow, row 6 at t=8 safe.\n\nSo possible: at t=6, row 5, do U to row 6 at t=7.\n\nt=7, row 6, do U to row 7 at t=8? But t=8 row 7 unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=7, I can go directly to row 8? No, I can only change by 1 row per turn.\n\nActions: U, D, S, so y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo from row 6, I can go to row 5,6,7.\n\nCannot skip to row 8.\n\nSo I have to go through each row.\n\nAt t=7, I am on row 6.\n\nIf I do U, to row 7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I do S, to row 6 at t=8, safe, then U at t=8 to row 7 at t=9, etc., as before.\n\nIf I do D at t=7, to row 5 at t=8.\n\nBut row 5 unsafe at t=8, so if I go to row 5 at t=8, collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nThus, I need to avoid being on row 7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, another idea: since row 5 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, I could leave row 5 before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=6, I do U to row 6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I am on row 6.\n\nNow, from here, if I do U at t=7, to row 7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nBut I can stay or go down, but go down to row 5 at t=8, which is unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps at t=6, I go down to row 4.\n\nt=6, row 5, do D: to row 4 at t=7.\n\nt=7, row 4.\n\nRow 4 safe at t=7? Row 4 unsafe only at t=12-14, so yes.\n\nThen at t=7, I can do U to row 5 at t=8.\n\nBut row 5 unsafe at t=8, so if I go to row 5 at t=8, collision.\n\nDo S at t=7, stay row 4 at t=8.\n\nt=8 row 4 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can do U to row 5 at t=9.\n\nBut row 5 unsafe at t=9, so collision at t=9.\n\nDo U to row 5 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=8, row 4, I can do U to row 5 at t=9, but unsafe.\n\nTo avoid row 5 at t=8 and t=9, I need to be on row 5 only before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nAfter t=9, row 5 is safe? After t=9, at t=10, row 5: from earlier, first car span at Δt=4, [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], min>0, safe. Similarly.\n\nSo row 5 safe for t<=7 and t>=10.\n\nUnsafe t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7 and 8, unsafe only t=8.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should not stay if possible.\n\nSo back to the first plan with 5 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by t=10 or earlier.\n\nt=6 start row 5.\n\nIf I can be on row 9 at t=10, that would be 4 actions: from t=6 to t=9 actions, reach at t=10.\n\nBut with 4 actions, I need to increase row by 4, so must all U, no S or D.\n\nSo actions: t=6: U to row 6 at t=7\n\nt=7: U to row 7 at t=8\n\nt=8: U to row 8 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to row 9 at t=10\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=7: on row 6, safe as before.\n\nt=8: on row 7, but row 7 unsafe at t=8, collision! Cannot.\n\nt=9: on row 8, row 8 unsafe at t=8, but t=9 is different.\n\nAt t=9, I am on row 8? In this sequence:\n\nAt t=8, I am on row 8? Let's see:\n\nt=6: after U, at t=7 on row 6\n\nt=7: after U, at t=8 on row 7\n\nt=8: after U, at t=9 on row 8\n\nt=9: after U, at t=10 on row 9\n\nSo at turn t=8, I am on row 7, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=9, I am on row 8, which at t=9 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut the problem is at t=8 on row 7.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on row 7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, I have to be on row 7 at some point.\n\nIf I can be on row 7 at t=7 or t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=7 on row 7 is possible.\n\nHow?\n\nStart t=6, row 5.\n\nIf I do U at t=6 to row 6 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, I am on row 6, not row 7.\n\nTo be on row 7 at t=7, I need to be on row 6 at t=6 and do U at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, I am on row 5, not row 6.\n\nI start on row 5 at t=6.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 7 at t=7, because to reach row 7 at t=7, I need to be on row 6 at t=6 and do U.\n\nBut at t=6, I am on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, earliest I can be on row 7 is t=8, if I do U at t=6 and t=7.\n\nBut t=8 is unsafe for row 7.\n\nI can be on row 7 at t=9, by doing actions later.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at row 5 until t=7.\n\nt=6: S, at t=7 row 5\n\nThen t=7: U, to row 6 at t=8\n\nt=8: on row 6\n\nThen t=8: U, to row 7 at t=9\n\nt=9: on row 7\n\nThen t=9: U, to row 8 at t=10\n\nt=10: on row 8\n\nThen t=10: U, to row 9 at t=11\n\nAs before, 5 actions.\n\nFrom row 6 at t=8, I could go up faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 1-4 are safe at t=8, I can go down to a lower row at t=8, but that would take me away from goal.\n\nFor example, at t=6, go down to row 4 at t=7.\n\nt=7: on row 4, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go up to row 5 at t=8, but row 5 unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nAt t=7, do S, stay row 4 at t=8.\n\nt=8: row 4 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, do U to row 5 at t=9, but row 5 unsafe at t=9, collision.\n\nAt t=8, do U to row 5 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, at t=8, since row 5 unsafe, I need to not go to row 5 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nBut if I go to row 5 at t=10, for example.\n\nBut that delays.\n\nFor instance, at t=8, row 4, I can do U to row 5 at t=9, unsafe, or do nothing, stay or go to row 3, etc.\n\nBut going down will take more time to go up later.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly from row 4 to row 5 after t=9.\n\nBut let's see the minimal time.\n\nThe direct up with no waiting takes 4 actions but fails at t=8.\n\nWith waiting, 5 actions work.\n\nBut is there a way with 4 actions?\n\nSuppose I go up but skip row 7 at t=8.\n\nBut I have to be on row 7 at some turn.\n\nThe only unsafe turn for row 7 is t=8, so I can be on row 7 at t=7,9,10,etc.\n\nBut I cannot be on row 7 at t=7 because I start at row 5 t=6.\n\nEarliest I can be on row 7 is t=8.\n\nt=8 is the only turn I can be on row 7 with minimal steps, but it's unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I must be on row 7 at a later turn, which requires waiting somewhere.\n\nThus, minimal actions should be 5, as in the first plan.\n\nIn the first plan with S at t=6 and then UUUU, or U then S then UUU, both 5 actions.\n\nIn both cases, I reach at t=11.\n\nt=6 start, after H actions, position at t=6+H.\n\nSince I start at turn t=6, after 0 actions, position at t=6.\n\nAfter first action at t=6, position at t=7, and so on.\n\nTo reach row 9, at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nWith H actions, I have y_{t_start + H} =9.\n\nt_start=6.\n\nWith 4 actions, y_{10} =9 possible only if I go up all the way.\n\nBut as above, not possible because must be on row 7 at t=8 which is unsafe.\n\nWith 5 actions, y_{11}=9 possible, as in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 9 earlier? No, because from row 5, min 4 steps.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but no, only one row per turn.\n\nSo I think 5 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first plan I thought: t=6: S, then t=7: U to row 6 at t=8? Let's list turns.\n\nSet t_relative = t - t_start = t - 6.\n\nSo at τ=0, turn 6, position row 5.\n\nAction a_{6} at turn 6.\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, turn 7, position depending on action.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to reach row 9 at some turn, say turn T, with minimal T-6.\n\nBut the number of actions H is such that after H actions, I am at turn t_start + H, at row 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_start to t_start + H -1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_start + H, position row 9.\n\nFor min H.\n\nWith H=4, turn 10, row 9, but not possible.\n\nH=5, turn 11, row 9.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nOne sequence: at τ=0 (t=6), action S: so at τ=1 (t=7), still row 5.\n\nThen action at τ=1 (t=7), U: to row 6 at τ=2 (t=8)\n\nThen action at τ=2 (t=8), U: to row 7 at τ=3 (t=9)\n\nThen action at τ=3 (t=9), U: to row 8 at τ=4 (t=10)\n\nThen action at τ=4 (t=10), U: to row 9 at τ=5 (t=11)\n\nNow, check each position:\n\nAt turn t=6 (τ=0): row 5, safe.\n\nAt turn t=7 (τ=1): row 5, safe as earlier (Δt=1, row 5 car1 [-17,-6], 0 not in)\n\nAt turn t=8 (τ=2): row 6, safe (row 6 unsafe only at t=16-18)\n\nAt turn t=9 (τ=3): row 7, safe (as before, span [-24,-1], 0 not in)\n\nAt turn t=10 (τ=4): row 8, similarly safe.\n\nThen after last action, at t=11, row 9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnother sequence: at t=6, U to row 6 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7, S: stay row 6 at t=8\n\nThen at t=8, U to row 7 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, U to row 8 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10, U to row 9 at t=11\n\nSame thing.\n\nIn this case, at t=7: row 6, safe.\n\nAt t=8: row 6, safe.\n\nt=9: row 7, safe.\n\netc.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nBut in both, H=5.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=4? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps if I go down first, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, go to row 4 and come back, but more than 5 actions.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for row 5, we have cars, but at t=6 and t=7, it was safe, but let's confirm t=7.\n\nt=7, row 5: Δt = t - t_start? t_start is turn reference, but for car movement, Δt from t=6.\n\nAt turn T, for car, Δt = T - 6.\n\nAt T=7, Δt=1.\n\nRow 5 cars: first car: [-23 +6*1, -12 +6*1] = [-17,-6], since right-moving, span [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: at T=7, [13+6*1,24+6*1]=[19,30], min=19>0, safe.\n\nThird car: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66]>0, safe. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nNow, row 6 at t=8: T=8, Δt=2, row 6 first car: [-51 +4*2, -40 +4*2] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43,-32], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32]>0, safe.\n\nRow 7 at t=9: T=9, Δt=3, span [48-72,71-72]=[-24,-1], 0 not in.\n\nRow 8 similar.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, one possible sequence is:\n\nTurn t_1 (t=6): S\n\nTurn t_1 +1 (t=7): U\n\nTurn t_1 +2 (t=8): U\n\nTurn t_1 +3 (t=9): U\n\nTurn t_1 +4 (t=10): U\n\nAnd reach row 9 at t=11.\n\nSince t_1=6, actions from t=6 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 4 for H=5.\n\na_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=5.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 6: S Turn 7: U Turn 8: U Turn 9: U Turn 10: U }\n\nBut the turn numbers: since t_1=6, so Turn 6, Turn 7, etc.\n\nIn the box, it should be as above.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nAnother sequence: Turn 6: U, Turn 7: S, Turn 8: U, Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U\n\nAlso works.\n\nIn this case, at Turn 6: U, to row 6 at t=7\n\nTurn 7: S, stay row 6 at t=8\n\nTurn 8: U, to row 7 at t=9\n\nTurn 9: U, to row 8 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: U, to row 9 at t=11\n\nSame.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I stayed at row 5 for an extra turn, but since row 5 is safe at t=7, it's ok.\n\nIn the second, I stayed at row 6.\n\nBoth are minimal.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, is there a sequence with H=4? Suppose I go to row 6 at t=7, then to row 7 at t=8, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr if I go down and up, but cannot gain time.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for row 5, there are multiple cars, but we considered.\n\nAlso, row 3 and 4 have unsafe times, but since I didn't go there, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe later, but not in this time frame.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Unsafe Times\n- **Row 1**: Always safe (car span never includes column 0 for \\(T \\geq 6\\)).\n- **Row 2**: Always safe (car span never includes column 0 for \\(T \\geq 6\\)).\n- **Row 3**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Row 4**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Row 5**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 8, 9\\) (due to the car with head \\(-12\\), tail \\(-23\\), direction right, speed 6).\n- **Row 6**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (due to the car with head \\(-40\\), tail \\(-51\\), direction right, speed 4); safe at turns \\(T = 6\\) to \\(T = 15\\).\n- **Row 7**: Unsafe at turn \\(T = 8\\) (due to the car with head 48, tail 71, direction left, speed 24); safe at other times.\n- **Row 8**: Unsafe at turn \\(T = 8\\) (due to the car with head 48, tail 71, direction left, speed 24); safe at other times.\n\nThe player starts at turn \\(t = 6\\) on row 5, which is safe at \\(t = 6\\) and \\(t = 7\\) but unsafe at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\). Rows 7 and 8 are unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\). To reach row 9, the player must ascend through rows 6, 7, and 8. However, being on row 7 or 8 at \\(t = 8\\) or on row 5 at \\(t = 8\\) or \\(t = 9\\) causes a collision.\n\nA direct ascent in 4 turns (actions: U, U, U, U) would place the player:\n- At \\(t = 8\\) on row 7, which is unsafe, leading to a collision.\n\nTherefore, a minimal sequence requires 5 turns (\\(H = 5\\)) to avoid unsafe times. One valid sequence is:\n- Stay on row 5 at \\(t = 6\\) (safe) to avoid being on row 5 at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- Move to row 6 at \\(t = 7\\) (safe).\n- Be on row 6 at \\(t = 8\\) (safe, as row 6 is not unsafe at \\(t = 8\\)).\n- Move to row 7 at \\(t = 9\\) (safe, as row 7 is unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\)).\n- Move to row 8 at \\(t = 10\\) (safe).\n- Move to row 9 at \\(t = 11\\) (safe, no cars on row 9).\n\nThis sequence uses actions: S (stay) at \\(t = 6\\), U (up) at \\(t = 7\\), U at \\(t = 8\\), U at \\(t = 9\\), and U at \\(t = 10\\), reaching row 9 at \\(t = 11\\) with \\(H = 5\\).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Turn 6: S (stay at row 5, safe at \\(t = 6\\))\n- Turn 7: U (move to row 6 at \\(t = 8\\), row 5 safe at \\(t = 7\\))\n- Turn 8: U (move to row 7 at \\(t = 9\\), row 6 safe at \\(t = 8\\))\n- Turn 9: U (move to row 8 at \\(t = 10\\), row 7 safe at \\(t = 9\\))\n- Turn 10: U (move to row 9 at \\(t = 11\\), row 8 safe at \\(t = 10\\))\n\nThis achieves the position (0, 9) at turn 11 with no collisions, and \\(H = 5\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays with U, D, S actions. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, since the goal is y=9, and I'm starting at y=5, I probably want to move up as much as possible. But I have to avoid the cars on the freeways when I'm on them at the right time.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at turn T. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 7. So I need to find actions from turn 7 onwards.\n\nPlayer position at turn 7 is (0,5).\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nI need to model where the cars are at future turns relative to t_1=7.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given by the head and tail at t_1, and the direction and speed.\n\nLet me define the time difference: let τ = T - t_1 = T - 7.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, span at T is [h - sτ, τ - sτ]? No.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but h and τ are positions, I think h is head, τ is tail.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in Span(T) for the freeway I'm on at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the cars are on specific freeways, I need to check for each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway as given:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=96, tail τ=49, direction right, speed s=48\n\nBut direction right, so it should be moving right, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [49, 96] since right-moving.\n\nThe notation says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], h is left end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSince it moves left, positions decrease, so if [h, τ] at t_1, with h and τ, but which is head? It says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but for left-moving, head might be on the left or right?\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in the head/tail definition.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1\"\n\nAnd then for direction: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, head is probably the front when moving right, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front when moving left, so head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning from left to right, τ to h.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] which makes sense, both increase.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] but if head is at h and it's moving left, head should be on the left, so [h, τ] with h < τ? Then when moving left, both decrease: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so if h < τ, h - sτ < τ - sτ, so the span shifts left.\n\nBut in the position, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the interval [min, max].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + sτ, h + sτ], and 0 in [min, max] of that.\n\nIn terms of interval, it's better to think of the left and right ends.\n\nLet me define for each car, the position of the left end and right end at time t_1, and then at time T, left and right ends based on direction.\n\nBut from the given, for each car, we have head and tail, which I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the min and max x at t_1 for each car.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If direction right: at t_1, min x = τ, max x = h\n\nThen at T, min x = τ + s(T - t_1), max x = h + s(T - t_1)\n\n- If direction left: at t_1, min x = h, max x = τ? From the span [h, τ], and since it moves left, min x decreases.\n\nIn the left-moving case, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which is from h to τ, so if h and τ, it could be h < τ or h > τ, but typically for left-moving, if head is left, h < τ, so [h, τ] with h min, τ max.\n\nThen Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], with τ min, h max, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is between min and max of its span at T.\n\nNow, for freeways, k from 1 to 8, but not all have cars, some have multiple.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so min at t_1: τ=49, max at t_1: h=96\n\nSpeed s=48\n\nFreeway 2: (96, 49, right, 48) same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so min at t_1: τ=-31, max at t_1: h=-20\n\nSpeed s=4\n\nFreeway 4: (-20, -31, right, 4) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-6, -17, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFor each:\n\nFirst car: (-6, -17, right, 6) — min τ=-17, max h=-6? But -17 < -6, so min=-17, max=-6\n\nSimilarly, second car: (30, 19, right, 6) — min τ=19, max h=30? 19<30, so min=19, max=30\n\nThird car: (-48, -59, right, 6) — min τ=-59, max h=-48? -59 < -48, min=-59, max=-48\n\nFreeway 6: (-36, -47, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: min τ=-47, max h=-36? -47 < -36, min=-47, max=-36\n\nSecond car: (28, 17, right, 4) min τ=17, max h=28, so min=17, max=28\n\nFreeway 7: (24, 47, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [24, 47], and since moving left, min at t_1: h=24, max τ=47? [h,τ] with h=24, τ=47, so min=24, max=47\n\nThen at T, min = 24 - sΔT, max = 47 - sΔT\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (24, 47, left, 24)\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 7, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway with cars, since cars are on y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is top, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, I might collide if a car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=5 to y=9, so I need to move up through y=6,7,8.\n\nBut I can also move down or stay, but since I want minimal turns, I should move up when possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's think about when the cars are at x=0 for each freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway, at turn T, for each car on that freeway, we need to check if min(T) <= 0 <= max(T) for some car.\n\nIf for a freeway, there is no car, then no collision, but all freeways have cars here.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have cars, etc., all listed.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince multiple cars, need to check for each car separately.\n\nBut for collision, if any car on that row has 0 in span, then collision if I'm there.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need the set of turns T where for some car on that freeway, min(T) <= 0 <= max(T).\n\nThen, when I am on that y at turn T, I collide if that condition holds.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nAlso, at T, I am on y_T, which is determined by my actions.\n\nLet me define the time from now: let t be the number of turns after t_1, so at time relative to now, τ = t, and absolute turn T = t_1 + t = 7 + t.\n\nAt t=0, T=7, y=5.\n\nI need to find actions for t=0,1,2,... up to some H, such that at some H, y_{7+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, position is after action, I think.\n\nThe player position at turn t+1 is after action at t.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe game says: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set based on that.\n\nBut the position at turn t is given as (0, y_t).\n\nSimilarly, for collision, it says at turn T, collision if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I might collide based on cars at T.\n\nNow, at turn T, when I am at y_T, the cars are at their span at T.\n\nNow, for the goal: I need to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1, and after H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince y_{t} is position at turn t, after action at t-1 or something.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,5).\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1}, which determines Δy for the move, so y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the position at turn T is y_T, and I take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I might collide if on freeway and car at x=0.\n\nThen I take action a_T, and go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe goal is to be at y=9, so I need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSince at T, if y_T=9, and 9 has no cars, so no collision, I win.\n\nT is the turn when I am at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo H is the number of turns from start to reach, including the action that gets me to 9 or something.\n\nLet's see: after 0 actions, at turn t_1, I am at y=5.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1, I am at some y.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nSo I need to find min H and actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H} =9 and no collision during the path, meaning for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when I am at y_T for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, no collision, and at t_1 + H, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision at that turn, so I only need to worry about turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, where I am on y=1 to 8 possibly.\n\nT from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 inclusive, I am at y_T, which could be 0 to 9, but if y_T=0 or 9, no collision, only if 1-8 and car at x=0.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nSo for turns T = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I must not collide.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway and each time, whether it is occupied at x=0.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 7.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their min and max at T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, min at t_1: 49, max at t_1: 96, speed s=48.\n\nAt time T, min(T) = 49 + 48*(T-7), max(T) = 96 + 48*(T-7)\n\n0 in span if min(T) <= 0 <= max(T)\n\nSince min(T) and max(T) are large and increasing, min(T) = 49 + 48(ΔT) >0 for ΔT >=0, so min(T) >0, so 0 < min(T) <= max(T), so 0 not in span, never occupied for any T. Similarly for freeway 2, same thing.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: min at t_1 is 49 and 96, both positive, and increasing, so min(T) >=49 >0, so x=0 never covered. So freeway 1 and 2 are always safe, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: car with min at t_1: τ=-31, max at t_1: h=-20, direction right, s=4.\n\nSo min(T) = -31 + 4(ΔT), max(T) = -20 + 4(ΔT)\n\n0 in span if min(T) <= 0 <= max(T)\n\n-31 + 4ΔT <= 0 <= -20 + 4ΔT\n\nLeft: -31 + 4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=31 => ΔT <= 31/4 = 7.75, so ΔT <=7 since integer? T and ΔT integer, I assume turns are integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -20 + 4ΔT => 4ΔT >=20 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo for ΔT from 5 to 7 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔT >=5 and ΔT <=7, so T = t_1 +5 to t_1 +7, i.e., turns 12 to 14? t_1=7, so T=7+5=12, 13,14.\n\nΔT=5,6,7: min(T) = -31 +4*5 = -31+20= -11 <=0, max(T)= -20+20=0, so 0<=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔT=6: min= -31+24= -7, max= -20+24=4, 0 in between.\n\nΔT=7: min= -31+28= -3, max= -20+28=8, 0 in.\n\nΔT=8: min= -31+32=1, max= -20+32=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= max? 0< min, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=4: min= -31+16= -15, max= -20+16= -4, both negative, 0 > max, not in.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 is same as freeway 3, so also occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars, all right-moving, s=6.\n\nFirst car: min at t_1: τ=-17, max: h=-6, so min(T) = -17 +6ΔT, max(T) = -6 +6ΔT\n\n0 in span if -17 +6ΔT <=0 <= -6 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -17+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=17 => ΔT <= 17/6≈2.833, so ΔT <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -6 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=6 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1 and 2.\n\nΔT=1: min= -17+6= -11, max= -6+6=0, 0<=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔT=2: min= -17+12= -5, max= -6+12=6, 0 in.\n\nΔT=0: min=-17<0, max=-6<0, 0 not <= max.\n\nΔT=3: min= -17+18=1>0, max=6>0, 0< min, not in.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: min at t_1: τ=19, max h=30, so min(T)=19+6ΔT, max(T)=30+6ΔT, both large positive, min>0, never 0 in span.\n\nThird car: min at t_1: τ=-59, max h=-48, so min(T)= -59 +6ΔT, max(T)= -48 +6ΔT\n\n0 in span if -59 +6ΔT <=0 <= -48 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/6≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT=8 and 9.\n\nΔT=8: min= -59+48= -11, max= -48+48=0, 0<=0<=0\n\nΔT=9: min= -59+54= -5, max= -48+54=6, 0 in\n\nΔT=10: min= -59+60=1>0, not\n\nFor freeway 5, first car has 0 at ΔT=1,2; second car never; third car at ΔT=8,9.\n\nSo overall for freeway 5, occupied at ΔT=1,2,8,9 i.e. T=8,9,15,16.\n\nt_1=7, ΔT=1: T=8, ΔT=2: T=9, ΔT=8: T=15, ΔT=9: T=16.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: min at t_1: τ=-47, max h=-36, right-moving, s=4.\n\nmin(T) = -47 +4ΔT, max(T) = -36 +4ΔT\n\n0 in if -47 +4ΔT <=0 <= -36 +4ΔT\n\nLeft: -47+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 11.75, so <=11\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=9\n\nSo for ΔT=9,10,11.\n\nΔT=9: min= -47+36= -11, max= -36+36=0, 0 in\n\nΔT=10: min= -47+40= -7, max= -36+40=4, 0 in\n\nΔT=11: min= -47+44= -3, max= -36+44=8, 0 in\n\nΔT=12: min= -47+48=1>0, not\n\nSecond car: min τ=17, max h=28, both positive, min(T)=17+4ΔT >=17>0, never 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 6, occupied at ΔT=9,10,11 i.e. T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 7: left-moving car, head h=24, tail τ=47, so at t_1, min=h=24, max=τ=47, s=24.\n\nDirection left, so min(T) = 24 - 24 ΔT, max(T) = 47 - 24 ΔT\n\n0 in span if min(T) <= 0 <= max(T)\n\nSince moving left, positions decreasing.\n\nmin(T) = 24 - 24ΔT, max(T) = 47 - 24ΔT\n\nNow, min(T) <=0 <= max(T)\n\nFirst, 0 <= max(T): 0 <= 47 - 24ΔT => 24ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond, min(T) <=0: 24 - 24ΔT <=0 => 24 <= 24ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo only for ΔT=1: min(T)=24-24=0, max(T)=47-24=23, so 0<=0<=23, yes.\n\nΔT=0: min=24, max=47, both >0\n\nΔT=2: min=24-48= -24, max=47-48= -1, both negative, 0 > max, not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=8.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same as 7, occupied only at T=8.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times when x=0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: never\n\nFreeway 2: never\n\nFreeway 3: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: T=12,13,14 (same as 3)\n\nFreeway 5: T=8,9,15,16\n\nFreeway 6: T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 7: T=8\n\nFreeway 8: T=8\n\nI need to go from y=5 at T=7 to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, but since I want min turns, I should move up when possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y_T, and y_T is a freeway that is occupied at T, I collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\ny_T can be 0 to 9.\n\nI start at T=7, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 is occupied at T=8,9,15,16, but at T=7, is it occupied? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 5, at T=7 (ΔT=0), min and max for cars: first car min=-17<0, max=-6<0, not occupied; second car min=19>0, not; third car min=-59<0, max=-48<0, not. So at T=7, freeway 5 not occupied, safe to be on.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so min steps if I always go up: from y=5, after one up, y=6 at T=8; up again y=7 at T=9; up y=8 at T=10; up y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo at T=11, y=11? T=7: y=5\n\nAfter action at T=7: if U, y8=6\n\nAt T=8, position y=6\n\nThen action a8, if U, y9=7 at T=9\n\na9 U, y10=8 at T=10\n\na10 U, y11=9 at T=11\n\nSo after 4 actions, at T=11, y=9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each turn from T=7 to T=10, if I collide, since at T=11, y=9 safe.\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5. At T=7, freeway 5 not occupied, as above, safe.\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6. At T=8, is freeway 6 occupied?\n\nFreeway 6: earlier, occupied at T=16,17,18. At T=8, ΔT=1, min and max: first car min=-47+4= -43, max=-36+4= -32, both negative; second car min=17+4=21>0, not occupied. So safe.\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7. At T=9, freeway 7 occupied? Earlier freeway 7 occupied only at T=8. At T=9, ΔT=2, min(T)=24-24*2=24-48=-24, max=47-48=-1, both negative, not occupied. So safe.\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly, freeway 8 occupied only at T=8, at T=10, ΔT=3, min=24-72=-48, max=47-72=-25, both negative, not occupied. Safe.\n\nThen T=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo with actions: at T=7: U, go to y=6\n\nT=8: U, to y=7\n\nT=9: U, to y=8\n\nT=10: U, to y=9\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nH=4 turns? After 4 actions, at T=11, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, so a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, and at T=11, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? From y=5 to y=9, min 4 moves up, so H=4 is minimum possible, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nWith S, I stay, but that would take more turns, so min H=4.\n\nAnd in this case, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the positions.\n\nAt T=7: y=5, freeway 5 not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, so y8=6.\n\nAt T=8: position y=6, freeway 6. At T=8, as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=7.\n\nAt T=9: y=7, freeway 7. At T=9, ΔT=2 for t_1, min=24-48=-24, max=47-48=-1, both <0, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=8.\n\nAt T=10: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly, ΔT=3, min=24-72=-48, max=47-72=-25<0, no car, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=9.\n\nAt T=11: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo actions: Turn 7: U, Turn 8: U, Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars, and at T=8 and T=9 it is occupied, but at T=8, I am on y=6, not y=5, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is occupied at T=8 and 9, but I am not on it at those times.\n\nIn my path, at T=8, I am on y=6; T=9 on y=7, etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since 4 steps min.\n\nUnless I start from y=5, and if I could jump, but no, only +1 per step.\n\nSo H=4 should be min.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 7 and 8 are occupied, but in my path, at T=8, I am on y=6, not y=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is occupied at T=8, but I am not on it until later.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at turn T, when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, at T=16,17,18 occupied, but I am not there at those times.\n\nIn my path, I am at T=8 on y=6, which is early.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach in less than 4 turns? Impossible, since from y=5 to y=9, need at least 4 up moves.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd I reach at turn 11.\n\nBut the actions are up to turn 10, and at turn 11 I am there.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut the format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc., and I need to specify H, but in the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nWith the actions.\n\nSo for H=4, actions at t=7,8,9,10.\n\nt_1=7, so Turn 7: U, Turn 8: U, Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for t from 0 to H-1, but relative to t_1.\n\nIn the output, it's absolute turns.\n\nNow, but I think I should confirm if at any point I might have issue.\n\nAnother thing: the player position, when I move, y changes immediately for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=7: y=5, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, safe (since freeway 7 not occupied at T=9)\n\nT=10: y=8, safe (freeway 8 not occupied at T=10)\n\nT=11: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr stay, same.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5, at T=8 and 9 occupied, but I'm not on y=5 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, at T=8, I am on it, and it is safe.\n\nNow, but let me see the initial position: at t_1=7, y=5.\n\nIs there a car on freeway 5 at T=7? As I said, no.\n\nBut just to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=7: cars: first car min=-17, max=-6, both <0; second min=19, max=30, both >0; third min=-59, max=-48, both <0; so no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 4 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=4.\n\nAnd sequence as above.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write it.\n\nPerhaps I should write the turns.\n\nSince t_1=7, and actions from turn 7 to turn 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? No.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by starting from different action, but no, at T=7 I am at y=5, after first action at T=7, I go to y=6 at T=8, etc., min T=11 to be at y=9.\n\nUnless I am already at y=9, but I'm not.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to avoid, but not necessary, and would increase H.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must move upwards (U) at every turn. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required is 4, as moving from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 4 upward moves, each increasing \\(y\\) by 1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 7, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nCollisions are avoided as follows:\n- At turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\), freeway 5): Freeway 5 is not occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- At turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\), freeway 6): Freeway 6 is not occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- At turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\), freeway 7): Freeway 7 is not occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (the car covers \\(x = 0\\) only at \\(T = 8\\), not at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- At turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\), freeway 8): Freeway 8 is not occupied at \\(x = 0\\) (the car covers \\(x = 0\\) only at \\(T = 8\\), not at \\(T = 10\\)).\n\nAt turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 8, at position (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). When we take an action at turn T, we are at (0, y_T) and then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy. So at turn T, we are on freeway y_T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 8). For any future turn T, we can compute the car's span by:\n  For a car at turn t1: [head, tail] (if right-moving, then head>tail; if left-moving, head<tail? Actually, the representation is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut note the update:\n  Left-moving: initially [h, τ] (so h is the head and τ the tail). Then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: initially [τ, h]? Actually, the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But the update rule says:\n      Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the initial state for right-moving is given as (head, tail). Let me check the example: \n  For freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 6) -> at t1=8, the span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? \n  But the representation says: (head, tail) = (0, -11) and direction right. \n\nHowever, the update rule for right-moving says: \n    Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the car (0, -11, right, 6) at t1=8, the span at T is:\n    τ = -11, h = 0 -> [ -11 + 6*(T-8), 0 + 6*(T-8) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: (0,23,left,24) at t1=8: \n    h = 0, τ = 23? But wait, the representation says (head, tail) = (0,23). Then update: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [0 - 24*(T-8), 23 - 24*(T-8)]\n\nBut note: in the left-moving update, the span is [h, τ] and then we subtract s*(T-t1). However, in the example representation, the head is 0 and tail is 23. But in a left-moving car, the head should be the front? Actually, the rule says: for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then we subtract s*(T-t1). So if the car is moving left, then at t1 the head is at h and the tail at τ, and then it moves left (decreasing x).\n\nHowever, note that the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, and if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span [a, b] (for the car at turn T).\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn, whether there is a car on that freeway that has a span covering 0 at that turn.\n\nWe start at y=6 at turn 8. We need to get to y=9.\n\nActions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: same y). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn 8 (t1) for H turns, until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if there is a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nLet me write down the cars per freeway at turn 8 (t1=8):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> this is right-moving, so at T, the span is:\n    [τ + s*(T-8), h + s*(T-8)] = [-95 + 48*(T-8), -48 + 48*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: (-16, -27, right, 4) -> [ -27 + 4*(T-8), -16 + 4*(T-8) ]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (-16, -27, right, 4) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n    car1: (0, -11, right, 6) -> [ -11 + 6*(T-8), 0 + 6*(T-8) ]\n    car2: (36, 25, right, 6) -> note: wait, this representation: head=36, tail=25? But in a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? Actually, the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] meaning the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? But here head=36 and tail=25? That doesn't make sense because 36>25, so if it's moving right, then the head is at 36 and tail at 25? Then the span at t1 is [25,36]. Then at T: [25+6*(T-8), 36+6*(T-8)]\n    But wait, the representation says (head, tail) = (36,25). However, the update rule for right-moving uses the tail and head in the order [τ, h] meaning the tail is the left end and head the right end. So if the car is at t1 with head=36 and tail=25, then τ=25 and h=36. So the update is [25+6*(T-8), 36+6*(T-8)].\n\n    car3: (-42, -53, right, 6) -> head=-42, tail=-53? Then τ=-53, h=-42 -> [-53+6*(T-8), -42+6*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n    car1: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> τ=-43, h=-32 -> [-43+4*(T-8), -32+4*(T-8)]\n    car2: (32,21,right,4) -> τ=21, h=32 -> [21+4*(T-8),32+4*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 7: (0,23,left,24) -> left-moving: [h - s*(T-8), τ - s*(T-8)] = [0 - 24*(T-8), 23 - 24*(T-8)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (0,23,left,24) -> same.\n\nWe are starting at (0,6) at turn 8. We are on freeway 6 at turn 8.\n\nCheck freeway 6 at turn 8: \n    car1: [-43+4*(0), -32+4*(0)] = [-43,-32] -> does 0 lie in this? No.\n    car2: [21+0,32+0] = [21,32] -> 0 not in [21,32]. So safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal H would be at least 3 because we are at 6, and we need to go up 3 steps: 6->7->8->9. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet's try the direct path: \n  Turn 8 (current): at y=6. Then we want to go up to 7 at turn 9, then 8 at turn 10, then 9 at turn 11.\n\nBut we must check for each turn and each freeway we are on.\n\nAt turn 8: we are on freeway 6 -> safe as above.\n\nAt turn 9: we plan to be at y=7. So we take action U at turn 8 -> then at turn 9 we are at y=7.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on freeway 7. Check freeway 7 at turn 9 (T=9, so T-8=1):\n    car: [0 - 24*1, 23 - 24*1] = [-24, -1] -> 0 is not in [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\nAt turn 10: we take U again -> at turn 10 we are at y=8.\n    Check freeway 8 at turn 10 (T=10, T-8=2):\n        car: same as freeway7 car? [0-24*2, 23-24*2] = [-48, -25] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nAt turn 11: we take U -> at turn 11 we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, at turn 11 we are at y=9, and there are no freeways above 8? The freeways are from 1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway? The problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So at y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn 8: U -> to y=7 at turn9\n  Turn 9: U -> to y=8 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> to y=9 at turn11\n\nTotal H=3 turns? But note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So we start at turn8 (t=0 in the sequence index) and we do 3 actions: turn8, turn9, turn10 -> then at turn11 we are at y=9. So H=3.\n\nBut we must verify that we are safe at every step.\n\nHowever, note that at turn8 we are at y=6 (safe). Then we take action U at turn8: so at turn9 we are at y=7. We just checked freeway7 at turn9: safe. Then at turn9 we take U: so at turn10 we are at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn10: safe. Then at turn10 we take U: at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait, at turn10 we are at y=8, and we take action U: then at turn11 we are at y=9. We don't need to check freeway at turn11 because we are at y=9 (which is above freeway8).\n\nSo this seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars on freeway7 and freeway8 at the required turns.\n\nFreeway7 at turn9 (T=9, T-8=1):\n  [0 - 24*1, 23 - 24*1] = [-24, -1] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10 (T=10, T-8=2):\n  [0 - 24*2, 23 - 24*2] = [-48, -25] -> no 0.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway6 at turn8, freeway7 at turn9, freeway8 at turn10. So we don't care about the others.\n\nHowever, note that we are moving and the cars are moving. But we only check the freeway we are on at the specific turn.\n\nBut wait: what if we are at freeway7 at turn9, but freeway7 has two cars? Actually, the table says freeway7 has one car: (0,23,left,24). Similarly freeway8 has one car: same as freeway7? Actually, the table says for freeway8: (0,23,left,24). So two identical cars? But they are on different freeways. So for freeway7 we only check the car on freeway7, and freeway8 only the car on freeway8.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is:\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn10: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So the first action is at t1 (which is 8). Then we have H=3, so t=0,1,2: \n  t=0: a_{8} = U\n  t=1: a_{9} = U\n  t=2: a_{10}= U\n\nBut the problem says \"until we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at turn 8+3-1 = turn10? But we are at y=9 at turn11? \n\nWait, let me reexamine the timing:\n\nAt turn t1 (8): we are at (0,6). Then we take an action a_{8} at turn8 to move to the next state at turn9.\n\nSo:\n  Turn8: we are at y=6. We take action a8 -> then at turn9, we are at y7 = y6 + Δy (if a8=U, then 7).\n  Then at turn9, we take a9 -> turn10: y8 = y7 + Δy.\n  Then at turn10, we take a10 -> turn11: y9.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y9. The turn when we are at (0,9) is turn11. But the last action is at turn10. The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n  t1 = 8\n  H = number of actions? Then the state after H actions would be at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo the last state we are interested in is at turn t1+H-1. \n\nIn our plan:\n  After 0 actions: at turn8: y8=6.\n  After 1 action: at turn9: y9=7.\n  After 2 actions: at turn10: y10=8.\n  After 3 actions: at turn11: y11=9.\n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n  We have t1+H-1 = 8+H-1 = 7+H.\n  We want 7+H = 11 -> H=4? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions, and the state after H actions is at turn t1+H, and we require that state to be (0,9). But then the minimal H would be 3, and we are at turn11 (8+3=11). But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y=9 at turn11. So we require:\n  8 + H - 1 = 11  -> H = 11-8+1 = 4.\n\nBut that would mean we do 4 actions? But we only need 3 moves. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be indexing the turns differently. \n\nLet me read carefully: \n  We are given the state at turn t1 (8). \n  We are to find a sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. \n  So t=0: action at turn t1+0 = t1\n  t=1: action at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  t=H-1: action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen after taking these H actions, we end at the state at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, note: the action taken at turn t affects the state at turn t+1. \n\nSo:\n  At turn t1 (8): we are at (0,6). Then we take action a8 -> at turn9 we are at (0, y9).\n  Then at turn9, we take a9 -> at turn10: (0,y10)\n  Then at turn10, we take a10 -> at turn11: (0,y11)= (0,9)\n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> y_{8+H-1}=9. We set 8+H-1=11 -> H=4? But we only took 3 actions. \n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning the actions are at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1.\n\nSo if H=3, then actions at turns 8,9,10 -> leading to state at turn11: y11=9. But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{8+3-1}=y10=9? But we are at y10=8, and then after the last action (at turn10) we go to y11=9. \n\nThe problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut in our plan, at turn10 (which is 8+3-1=10) we are at y=8, not 9. \n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn10? How? \n\nAlternatively, we might have misread the problem. \n\nLet me reread: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the turn when we are at (0,9) is turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at (0,9) at turn11. So we need t1+H-1=11 -> 8+H-1=11 -> H=4.\n\nBut then we have to do 4 actions? How? We start at 6, and we need to get to 9 in 4 actions? That would be 3 steps up and one stay? But we can do:\n\nOption 1: \n  Turn8: U -> y=7 at turn9\n  Turn9: U -> y=8 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> y=9 at turn11 -> but we are at turn11, but we need to be at y=9 at turn10? \n\nWe cannot be at y=9 at turn10 if we start at 6 at turn8: that would require 3 steps, so the earliest is turn11.\n\nBut wait, what if we do an extra action? We are at y=9 at turn11, but then we have to have the last action at turn10. Then we are at y=9 at turn11. But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if H=4, then t1+H-1=8+4-1=11. That matches.\n\nTherefore, H=4. The sequence of actions is for turns 8,9,10, and we are at (0,9) at turn11 (which is 8+4-1=11).\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. For H=4, t from 0 to 3: \n  t=0: a8\n  t=1: a9\n  t=2: a10\n  t=3: a11? \n\nBut wait, we have H=4 actions, so we have actions at turns 8,9,10,11? But we are already at y=9 at turn11? Then if we take an action at turn11, we might move away? \n\nBut note: we only need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 8+4-1=11. So we can take the last action at turn10 to get to y=9 at turn11. Then we don't need to take an action at turn11. \n\nThe sequence should be of H actions, and the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. But if H=4, then we have actions at 8,9,10,11. But at turn11, we are at y=9 (from turn11 state, which is the result of the action at turn10). Then the action at turn11 is taken? But we are already at the goal. \n\nThe problem does not say we stop when we reach. It says we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. So at turn11 (which is t1+3) we are at 9. But the action at turn11 might move us away? \n\nWe can set the action at turn11 to be S (stay) if we are at 9? But we are at 9 at turn11, so we can do S at turn11 to stay at 9? Then we are still at 9 at turn12? But the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn11 (t1+H-1=8+4-1=11). \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Turn8: U -> turn9: y=7\n  Turn9: U -> turn10: y=8\n  Turn10: U -> turn11: y=9\n  Turn11: S -> turn12: y=9\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn11 and turn12. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn11. The action at turn11 is not necessary? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions. And we must have H=4? \n\nAlternatively, we might be able to get to 9 earlier? \n\nBut we start at 6 at turn8. To get to 9, we need at least 3 moves (each U). The earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn11 (if we do U at 8,9,10). \n\nSo we must have at least 3 moves. But then the state at turn11 is 9. We need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So 8+H-1=11 -> H=4. \n\nTherefore, we do 4 actions: the first three are U (to get to 9 by turn11) and the fourth action can be arbitrary? But we must not collide. However, note that after we are at 9, we are safe because there are no freeways above 8. \n\nBut the action at turn11: we are at y=9 at turn11. Then we take an action at turn11: \n  If we do U: we try to go to 10 -> not allowed? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot go above 9. So if we do U at turn11, we remain at 9? The problem says: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, but then clamped to [0,9]. \n  So if we are at 9 and do U, then we try 10 -> then clamped to 9. \n  Similarly, D: 8, but then we leave the goal? \n  S: stay at 9.\n\nSo we can do S at turn11 to stay at 9. \n\nBut we must check that at turn11, when we are at y=9, we are safe (and we are, because no freeway at 9). \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: S\n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn11 (from the action at turn10) and then we do S at turn11 to remain at 9 at turn12. \n\nBut the condition is that at turn11 (which is t1+H-1=8+4-1=11) we are at 9. We are indeed at 9 at turn11 (and also at turn12). \n\nHowever, note that we are required to avoid collisions only on freeways 1-8. So at y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the action at turn10? We are at y=8 at turn10. Then we take action U: which moves us to y=9 at turn11. But at turn10, we are at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn10: \n  We have a car: (0,23,left,24) -> at turn10 (T=10, T-8=2): [0-24*2, 23-24*2] = [-48,-25] -> 0 not in there. So safe.\n\nSo the entire sequence is safe.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? Then we would be at (0,9) at turn t1+3-1=10. So we need to be at 9 at turn10. \n\nHow?\n  Start at turn8: y=6.\n  Turn8: action -> turn9: y7\n  Turn9: action -> turn10: y8? or y9?\n\nTo get to 9 by turn10, we need to cover 3 units in 2 moves: that would require two U and then we would be at 8 at turn10? \n\nWe do:\n  Turn8: U -> y=7 at turn9\n  Turn9: U -> y=8 at turn10\n\nBut we are at 8 at turn10, not 9. \n\nAlternatively, if we could do a double move? But the actions are only one step per turn. \n\nSo minimal H is 4? \n\nBut wait, what if we start at 6 and we do a U at turn8 -> 7 at turn9, then at turn9 we do U -> 8 at turn10, then at turn10 we do U -> 9 at turn11. Then we are at 9 at turn11. To have that as the state at turn10? We can't. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We are taking 4 actions, and we end at turn11 (which is 8+4-1=11? or 8+4=12?).\n\nClarification: \n  We take H actions: at turns 8,9,10,...,8+H-1.\n  The state after the H actions is at turn 8+H.\n  But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1=8+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we require that at turn (8+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nIn the sequence above (with 3 moves U at 8,9,10) we are at 9 at turn11. So we require 8+H-1=11 -> H=4.\n\nTherefore, we output H=4 and the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S   (to stay at 9)\n\nBut we must check that at turn11, when we are at y=9, we are safe (which we are). \n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nTurn8: U -> turn9:7\nTurn9: U -> turn10:8\nTurn10: U -> turn11:9\nTurn11: D -> then we go to 8 at turn12? But then we are not at 9 at turn11? We are at 9 at turn11, but then we do D at turn11: then at turn12 we are at 8. But the requirement is only that at turn11 we are at 9. So we can do D? But then the state at turn11 is 9 (from the previous action) and we do D at turn11 to go to 8 at turn12. But that doesn't harm the condition? The condition only requires that at turn11 we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to remain at 9. So we can do D at turn11? However, that would be unnecessary and might be confusing. Better to do S.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\": we found a sequence with H=4. \n\nBut wait, what if we do:\n\n  Turn8: S -> stay at 6 at turn9\n  Turn9: U -> 7 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> 8 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> 9 at turn12\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn12. Then we require 8+H-1=12 -> H=5. That's worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 that gets us to 9 earlier? No, because we need at least 3 moves. \n\nAnother possibility: what if we go down? But that would take more steps. \n\nSo the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nBut we must check for collisions in the entire path. \n\nWe already checked:\n  Turn8: y=6 -> safe (as given)\n  Turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=9 (T-8=1): [0-24*1, 23-24*1] = [-24,-1] -> safe.\n  Turn10: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=10 (T-8=2): [0-24*2,23-24*2]=[-48,-25] -> safe.\n  Turn11: y=9 -> safe (no freeway)\n\nBut note: at turn11 we are at y=9, then we take action S at turn11: then at turn12 we are still at y=9. But we don't care beyond turn11 because the condition is only for turn11 to be at 9.\n\nHowever, we must also check that during the actions we don't collide? \n\nSpecifically, at turn11 we are at y=9, and we take action S: so we are at (0,9) at turn11 and then we remain at (0,9) at turn12. But since we are at y=9, no freeway to check. \n\nBut what about the action at turn10? We are at y=8 at turn10 and we take U: that moves us to y=9 at turn11. But at the moment of taking the action (at turn10) we are at y=8, so we only check freeway8 at turn10 (which we did).\n\nSo the entire sequence is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we are at y=8 at turn10 and we take U: then at turn11 we are at y=9. The collision condition only applies at the turn when we are on a freeway. So at turn10 we are on freeway8 and safe. At turn11 we are on freeway? None (y=9) so safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4. \n\nAlternatively, is there a sequence that gets us to 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe are at 6 at turn8. We need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=8+H-1. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn11 (if we use 3 moves). So 8+H-1>=11 -> H>=4. So minimal H is 4.\n\nOne more thing: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". When we are at y=0 or y=9, we are not on any freeway? So safe. \n\nBut note: the player update: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we can be at 0 or 9.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal and safe.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the extra action? The problem requires H actions and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9. In our case, we are at 9 at turn11 (t1+3) and we set H=4, then t1+H-1=8+4-1=11. So it matches.\n\nBut we are forced to do an extra action? Yes, because we have to specify H actions. And the last action (at turn11) doesn't harm.\n\nWe could also do:\n\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U   -> but that would also stay at 9? Because 9+1=10 -> clamped to 9.\n\nSo U or S at turn11 are equivalent.\n\nBut S is more natural.\n\nSo the answer.\n\nBut wait, what about the car on freeway5? We never go to freeway5? We are at 6,7,8,9. So freeway5 (y=5) is not visited.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1,2,3,4,5: we are at 6,7,8,9. So we skip them.\n\nBut note: freeway5 has a car at (0, -11, right, 6) -> at turn8: [-11,0]. So at turn8, if we were at freeway5, we would be collided? But we are at freeway6 at turn8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWhat if we start at 6 at turn8. Then if we do nothing (S) we stay at 6. Then we have to do 3 moves later. \n\nOr if we do D? Then we go to 5 at turn9. Then we have to go up from 5 to 9: 4 moves, which would take until turn13? So worse.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=4, we have t=0,1,2,3: \n  t=0: turn8: U\n  t=1: turn9: U\n  t=2: turn10: U\n  t=3: turn11: S\n\nSo that matches.\n\nNote: we could do without the S if the problem allowed H=3 and then we are at 9 at turn11? But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. For H=3: turn t1+H-1=8+3-1=10. We would be at 8 at turn10. So that doesn't satisfy.\n\nHence, we must have H=4.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn 8 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(k\\) at turn \\(T\\) and there exists a car on freeway \\(k\\) such that the player's x-coordinate (0) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial State (Turn 8)**:\n  - Player position: (0, 6)\n  - Freeway 6 is safe at turn 8 (car spans: [-43, -32] and [21, 32]; 0 not in either span).\n- **Target Position**: (0, 9) (above freeway 8, so no collision risk).\n- **Minimal Path**: The player must move up 3 units (from y=6 to y=9). Each \"U\" action increases y by 1. The earliest possible arrival at y=9 is turn 11 (after actions at turns 8, 9, and 10). However, the sequence must ensure the player is at (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + H - 1\\).\n  - To be at (0, 9) at turn 11: \\(8 + H - 1 = 11\\) → \\(H = 4\\).\n  - Thus, \\(H = 4\\) actions are required, ending at turn 11.\n\n### Collision Checks for the Path:\n- **Turn 8 (y=6)**: Safe (as given).\n- **Turn 9 (y=7)**:\n  - Freeway 7 car: (0, 23, left, 24)\n  - At \\(T = 9\\) (\\(T - 8 = 1\\)): span = \\([0 - 24 \\times 1, 23 - 24 \\times 1] = [-24, -1]\\)\n  - 0 ∉ [-24, -1] → safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y=8)**:\n  - Freeway 8 car: (0, 23, left, 24)\n  - At \\(T = 10\\) (\\(T - 8 = 2\\)): span = \\([0 - 24 \\times 2, 23 - 24 \\times 2] = [-48, -25]\\)\n  - 0 ∉ [-48, -25] → safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y=9)**: No freeway at y=9 → safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 8 (action)**: Move up to y=7 at turn 9 → action \\(U\\).\n- **Turn 9 (action)**: Move up to y=8 at turn 10 → action \\(U\\).\n- **Turn 10 (action)**: Move up to y=9 at turn 11 → action \\(U\\).\n- **Turn 11 (action)**: Remain at y=9 (since goal is achieved at turn 11, but an action is required for \\(H=4\\)) → action \\(S\\) (stay) to ensure no movement.\n\n### Output:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 4\\).

We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical) and the x-coordinate is always 0 for the player.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T and the car on that freeway has a span that includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, we are considered to be on y at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T) and then at turn T+1 we are on y' (so we check the car on freeway y' at turn T+1).\n\nWe start at y=7 at turn 9. We must avoid the cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are to provide a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting at turn 9 until we reach y=9.\n\nLet's analyze the car movements. The cars move continuously. For a car at freeway k, given at turn t1 (which is 9) the head and tail, and direction and speed.\n\nThe update for a car at turn T (T>=t1) is:\n\n- Left-moving (d='left'): the car moves to the left. The span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? But note the representation: \n  In the problem, for left-moving, the initial span at t1 is [h, tau] (but note that h and tau are given, and for left-moving, as time increases, the car moves left so the positions decrease.\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48) -> this is (head, tail, direction, speed). \nBut wait: for right-moving, the problem says: \n  Initially at t1: [tau, h] -> but in the table it's given as (head, tail, ...). \n\nLet me clarify: \n  The problem says for right-moving: \n      \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). \n  Here, head=0, tail=-47. But note that for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the span should be [tail, head]? \n  Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tail to head? \n\nSo in the table, for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? and tail the smaller? \n  Example: freeway1: head=0, tail=-47 -> so the car extends from -47 to 0? That's 48 units long? (0 - (-47) = 47? Actually, the number of units is 48? Because from -47 to 0 inclusive is 48 units? \n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at T=t1: [tau, h] = [-47, 0] for freeway1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  Example freeway7: (-24, -1, left, 24) -> head=-24, tail=-1? \n  But the problem says for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> so at t1: [h, tau] = [-24, -1]? \n  Then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] = [-24 - 24*(T-9), -1 - 24*(T-9)]\n\nHowever, note that in a left-moving car, the head is the front? Then the head should be at the leftmost? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? So the span is [head, tail] but if head=-24 and tail=-1, that would imply the car is from -24 to -1? But then the head is at -24 and the tail at -1? and as it moves left, both head and tail decrease.\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \n      \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\"\n  and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the order in the tuple is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nTherefore, for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost point? and tail is the rightmost? So the car spans from head to tail (with head <= tail). \n\nIn freeway7: head=-24, tail=-1 -> so the car is from -24 to -1? That is 24 units? (from -24 to -1 inclusive: 24 units? -24 to -1 is 24 units? Actually, the number of units is (-1) - (-24) + 1 = 24? \n\nBut the speed is 24, which is the same as the length? \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost? So freeway1: head=0, tail=-47 -> the car is from -47 to 0, which is 48 units? and speed=48? \n\nSo the car moves at a speed equal to its length? \n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on freeway k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 9 and we are at y=7. We are going to plan the moves.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 2: \n  turn9: U -> y=8\n  turn10: U -> y=9\n\nBut we must check if we can do that without colliding.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at turn 9: \n  We are at y=7 at turn9, so we are not on freeway8 at turn9. \n  Then at turn10: we move to y=8? Actually, we plan:\n  turn9: we are at y=7 -> we take action U -> then at turn10 we will be at y=8.\n\nBut note: at turn9, we are at y=7 -> so we must check freeway7 at turn9? Yes.\n\nAt turn9 (current turn): \n  freeway7: left-moving car: head=-24, tail=-1, speed=24.\n  So at T=9: [h, tau] = [-24, -1] -> does 0 fall in [-24, -1]? \n      -24 <= 0 <= -1? -> no, because 0 is greater than -1.\n\nSo at turn9, we are safe at freeway7? But wait, we are at y=7 at turn9, so we are on freeway7? and the car at freeway7 at turn9: \n  The span is [-24, -1] -> which is from -24 to -1, so 0 is not in that interval? So we are safe.\n\nThen at turn9: we take U -> so at turn10 we are at y=8.\n\nAt turn10: we are at y=8 -> so we must check freeway8 at turn10.\n\nFreeway8: left-moving car: head=-24, tail=-1, speed=24 (same as freeway7? because the table says freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24))\n\nAt turn10: T = 10, so T-t1 = 1.\n  The car on freeway8: \n      Span(10) = [h - s*(10-9), tau - s*(10-9)] = [-24 - 24*1, -1 - 24*1] = [-48, -25]\n\nDoes 0 fall in [-48, -25]? -> no.\n\nSo we can then take U at turn10 to go to y=9 at turn11? But wait, we are at y=8 at turn10, then we take U at turn10 -> then at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the sequence. So we need to be at y=9 at the last turn. So if we do:\n\n  turn9: U -> at turn10: y=8\n  turn10: U -> at turn11: y=9\n\nThen we have reached at turn11. So H=2? But note the sequence: \n  We start at t1=9, and we have two actions: at turn9 and turn10, so H=2? \n  But the position at the end of the second action (at turn11) is y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? \n\nActually, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions? \n\nWe start at turn t1=9. We do an action at turn9 (which is the first action, t=0 in the sequence index) and then at turn10 (t=1) and then we are at turn11 (after 2 actions) at y=9. \n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut wait, we must check at turn11? \n\nAt turn11: we are at y=9. The freeways are only from 1 to 8, so we don't check freeways at y=9? \n\nTherefore, we are safe at turn11.\n\nBut what about during the moves? \n\nWe have to ensure that at each turn when we are at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) the car on that freeway does not cover 0.\n\nWe have checked:\n  turn9: at y=7 -> freeway7: safe (0 not in [-24,-1])\n  turn10: at y=8 -> freeway8: safe (0 not in [-48,-25])\n\nThen at turn11: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, so safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, what if we want to go faster? That's the minimal: 2 turns.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger? \n\nWe must also consider that we might have to wait? But 2 moves up is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that when moving, at the turn we are still on the current freeway. \n\nAt turn9: we start at y=7 -> so we are on freeway7 at turn9 -> safe.\n\nWe move U at turn9 -> so at turn10 we are at y=8 -> so we are on freeway8 at turn10 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10 we move U -> at turn11 we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo that seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions at the exact turns.\n\nFreeway7 at turn9 (T=9): \n  Car: left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? \n  But t1=9, so T-t1=0 -> [h, tau] = [-24, -1] -> 0 not in [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10 (T=10): \n  Car: left-moving: [h - s*(10-9), tau - s*(10-9)] = [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48, -25] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We didn't step on them? So we don't care.\n\nBut wait, what if we try to go faster? We can't, because we start at 7 and we need to get to 9: two moves up.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in one move? \n  If we do U at turn9: then at turn10 we would be at y=8? Not 9. \n  To get to 9 in one move? But we start at 7: U would get to 8, then we need another U to get to 9. So minimum 2.\n\nBut wait, what if we do nothing? Then we stay at 7. Then we would need at least two moves later? So 2 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a problem? \n\nWait, look at freeway5 and freeway6: they have multiple cars. But we are not stepping on them? \n\nBut note: at turn9 we are at freeway7, and then at turn10 we are at freeway8. So we skip freeway5 and 6? \n\nBut what if we had to go through them? We don't.\n\nBut wait, the freeways are fixed: freeway1 is at y=1, freeway2 at y=2, ... freeway8 at y=8.\n\nSo we are at y=7 (freeway7) at turn9, then y=8 (freeway8) at turn10, then y=9 at turn11.\n\nSo we never step on freeways 1-6? So we don't care about the cars there.\n\nBut wait, what about if we go down? That would be worse. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car on freeway7 or freeway8 that might hit us in the next two turns? \n\nWe already checked the cars on freeway7 at turn9 and freeway8 at turn10.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the cars are moving. However, we are checking at the exact turn we are on the freeway.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn10? We are not on freeway7 at turn10? Because at turn10 we are at y=8. So we don't check freeway7 at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, we are not on freeway8 at turn9? So we only check the freeway we are standing on at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, the table shows that freeway5 has three cars? and freeway6 has two? but we don't step on them.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, let me check the starting turn: the current turn is t1=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  at turn9: action U\n  at turn10: action U\n\nThen at turn11, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the answer format says: \n  Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n  Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n  ...\n\nSo t1=9, so:\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n\nBut wait, after two actions we are at turn11? and we have reached. So we don't need to write beyond.\n\nBut what if we have to wait? We don't.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway8 car at turn10: \n  freeway8: left-moving, head=-24, tail=-1, speed=24.\n  At turn10: [head - speed*(10-9), tail - speed*(10-9)] = [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48, -25] -> doesn't include 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn9: [-24, -1] -> doesn't include 0.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 car: at turn9, it's at [-24,-1]. Then at turn10, it moves to [-48,-25]. So it's moving away.\n\nBut what about freeway5? We don't step on it.\n\nBut wait, what if we consider if we had to go through freeway5? We don't.\n\nBut there's a potential issue: the problem says that the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. We are starting at y=7 (freeway7) and then going to freeway8 and then to y=9.\n\nBut note: the player update: we are at (0,7) at turn9.\n\nAction at turn9: U -> y becomes 8 at turn10? \n  But wait: the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n  So at turn9 (current) we are at y7. Then we do U: so at turn10, y10 = 7+1 = 8.\n\nThen at turn10: we do U: so at turn11, y11=8+1=9.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer? We can't.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider going down? That would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=2? meaning 2 actions? \n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions? and we reach at the end of the H-th action? \n\nYes.\n\nBut let me see the example of the car on freeway5? There are three cars on freeway5: \n  (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nBut we are not on freeway5 at any time? So we ignore.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: two cars? we ignore.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We are going to be on freeway8 at turn10.\n\nWait, the table for freeway8: same as freeway7? \n  freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nSo same as freeway7? \n\nBut note: freeway7 and freeway8 have the same car configuration? \n\nBut they are different freeways? So we have to check separately.\n\nWe did.\n\nBut wait, at turn10: freeway8 car: we computed [-48,-25]? \n\nBut let me compute the length: the car length is (-1) - (-24) + 1 = 24? and speed=24? so it moves one car length per turn? \n\nAt turn10, the car has moved one car length to the left? so the entire car is shifted left by 24? so from -24-24=-48 to -1-24=-25? so 0 is not in there.\n\nBut what if we consider the car on freeway5? It has a car that is at (6, -5, right, 6). \n  At turn9: for freeway5, the first car: (head=6, tail=-5, right, speed=6). \n  For right-moving: at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] \n  At turn9: [tau, head] = [-5, 6] -> so the car is from -5 to 6? \n  At turn9: does 0 fall in [-5,6]? yes! because -5<=0<=6.\n\nBut we are not on freeway5 at turn9? We are at y=7. So we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn10: the first car on freeway5: \n  [ -5 + 6*(10-9), 6 + 6*(10-9) ] = [ -5+6, 6+6 ] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? so safe.\n\nBut again, we are not on freeway5.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway5? We don't.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about the other cars on freeway5? \n  The second car: (42,31,right,6): \n      At turn9: [tau, head] = [31,42]? -> but wait, the tuple is (head, tail) -> head=42, tail=31? \n      But for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost? so tail should be the leftmost? \n      But 31 is less than 42? so the car is from 31 to 42? \n      At turn9: [31,42] -> 0 not in [31,42]? \n      At turn10: [31+6, 42+6] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n  The third car: (-36,-47,right,6): \n      At turn9: [tau, head] = [-47, -36]? -> so [-47,-36] -> 0 not in there? \n      At turn10: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: \n  First car: (-28,-39,right,4): \n      At turn9: [tau, head] = [-39, -28] -> 0 not in there? \n      At turn10: [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n  Second car: (36,25,right,4): \n      At turn9: [25,36]? -> 0 not in there? \n      At turn10: [25+4,36+4]=[29,40] -> safe.\n\nSo no car on any freeway we are not stepping on is going to hit us? and the ones we step on are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two moves up.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway8? We have a car that at turn10 is at [-48,-25]? but what if we had stayed? \n\nWe don't stay.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if we move to a different freeway, we are not considered on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nSo at turn9: we are at freeway7 -> safe.\nAt turn10: we are at freeway8 -> safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut wait, the car on freeway7 at turn10: \n  It moves to [-48,-25]? but we are not on freeway7 at turn10? so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, the car on freeway8 at turn9: \n  At turn9: for freeway8: left-moving: [h, tau] = [-24,-1]? -> 0 not in there? but we are not on freeway8 at turn9? so we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if we do nothing at turn9: \n  Then at turn9: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: safe? \n  Then at turn10: we are still at y=7? so we must check freeway7 at turn10.\n\nFreeway7 at turn10: \n  left-moving: [h - s*(10-9), tau - s*(10-9)] = [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48,-25] -> 0 not in there? so safe.\n\nBut then we are still at 7 and we haven't reached 9. So we would need two more moves? which would take 3 turns? not minimal.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t_1\" and we are to write the actions starting at t_1.\n\nSo that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) on turn 9. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. \n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (turn 9)**: y = 7 (freeway 7).\n- **Target Position**: y = 9 (no freeway, so no collision check needed).\n- **Minimal Path**: The player must move up twice to reach y = 9 from y = 7. This requires 2 turns (actions at turn 9 and turn 10), resulting in position (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\n### Collision Checks:\n- **Turn 9 (y = 7)**: \n  - Freeway 7 has a left-moving car: initial span at turn 9 is [-24, -1] (given as head = -24, tail = -1, direction left, speed 24).\n  - At turn 9 (T = 9, T - t₁ = 0): span = [-24, -1].\n  - 0 is not in [-24, -1] (since -24 ≤ 0 ≤ -1 is false). Safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y = 8)**:\n  - Freeway 8 has a left-moving car: initial span at turn 9 is [-24, -1] (same as freeway 7).\n  - At turn 10 (T = 10, T - t₁ = 1): span = [-24 - 24×1, -1 - 24×1] = [-48, -25].\n  - 0 is not in [-48, -25] (since -48 ≤ 0 ≤ -25 is false). Safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y = 9)**: No freeway at y = 9, so no collision check needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to y = 8.\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to y = 9.\n\nThis achieves the goal in H = 2 turns (minimal possible).\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player starts at y=8 on turn t=10, and I need to reach y=9. Since I'm already at y=8, and y=9 is the goal, I might be able to go up directly if it's safe.\n\nThe collision rule says that a collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only check the row I'm currently on for collisions.\n\nAt turn T, after moving, I'm at position y_{T}, and I check for cars on freeway y_T at that turn T. If I move up or down, at turn T, I'm on the new row only at turn T+1.\n\nLet me read the update carefully.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at time t.\n\nSo, at time t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at time t+1, I am at position (0, y_{t+1}), and I check for collisions on freeway y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAnd since I move to y_{t+1} at time t+1, I need to ensure that at time t+1, on freeway y_{t+1}, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on the same row, I need to check that row at that time.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=10, position (0,8).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince I'm at y=8, to go to y=9, I need to take action U, which would make y_{11} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nThen, at turn 11, I would be at (0,9), and I need to check if there's a collision on freeway 9 at turn 11.\n\nBut freeway 9? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, I think. Let me check.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9. But the freeways with cars are on y=1 to 8, as per the car state table.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the edges, I think, without cars? The problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, probably safe.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8.\"\n\nAnd the goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nAlso, in the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nBut if y_T is not between 1 and 8, there are no cars, so no collision.\n\nSpecifically, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if I'm on y=0 or y=9, there can be no collision, because there are no cars on those rows.\n\nIs that right?\n\nThe freeways are only y=1 to 8, so for y=0 and y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, in the player position, y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the top row.\n\nNow, I start at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nIf I take action U at turn 10, then at turn 11, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn 11, y_T = 9, which has no cars, so no collision possible. So I should be able to reach in one turn: from turn 10 to turn 11.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and after H turns, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet me see the notation.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt_1 is given as 10.\n\nSo actions from a_{10} to a_{10 + H - 1}, and after these actions, at time t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, if H=1, then action at t=10 only, and y_{10 + 1 - 1} = y_{10} =8, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, t_1 + H -1 =10 +1 -1=10, y_10=8 ≠9.\n\nSo I need to reach at time t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I take no action, I stay, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nAt time t, I take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t_1, I am at y_{t_1} =8.\n\nI take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at time t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor instance, if I go directly, at turn t_1=10, I take U, then y_{11} =9.\n\nThen at time t_1 +1 =11, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 should be 11.\n\nSo 10 + H -1 =11, so H=2.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the position at time t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt time t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAt time t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action a_t, at time t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from time t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these actions, at time (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need position at time t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9)? No.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at time t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position to be (0,9) at time t_1 + H -1, that means at that time, I am on row 9.\n\nThen, I might take an action, but the goal is just to be at (0,9) at some turn, so at time t_1 + H -1, I should be at y=9.\n\nIn terms of when I arrive.\n\nSince I start at time t_1 at y=8, if I take U at t_1, then at time t_1+1, I am at y=9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at time t_1 +1, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1, thus H-1=1, H=2.\n\nFor example, H=2: actions at t=10 and t=11? But at t=11, I might not need to act if I'm already at goal.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions until I reach, but since at time t_1 + H -1 I am at y=9, I don't need to act further, so H actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at time t_1 + H -1 I am at position after the actions? Let's see.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt time t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nWe set y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor that to happen, it depends on previous actions.\n\nIf I start at t_1 at y=8, and I want to be at y=9 at time t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf H=1, t_1 + H -1 = t_1, y_t1=8≠9.\n\nIf H=2, t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1, so I need y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nWhich means at time t1, I take U, so a_{t1} = U.\n\nThen at time t1+1, y=9.\n\nAnd for H=2, I have one action: a_{t1}, and y_{t1 +1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 +1 for H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to the collision.\n\nAt time t1=10, I am at y=8.\n\nI take action U at t=10, so y_{11} =9.\n\nNow, at time t=11, I am at y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nSo I should be able to do this in one action, but H=2? H is the number of turns, but in terms of actions, it's one action to go from 8 to 9.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nIn this case, for H=2, I have action at t1 only? Let's list.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=2, actions at t1+0 and t1+1, so times 10 and 11.\n\nAt time 10, I take a_{10}, which affects y_{11}.\n\nAt time 11, I take a_{11}, which affects y_{12}.\n\nBut at time t1 + H -1 =10 +2 -1=11, we need y_{11}=9.\n\nSo if at time 10, I take U, then y_{11}=9, so at time 11, I am at 9.\n\nThen at time 11, I might take some action, but since I'm already at goal, I can take S or whatever, but the position at time 11 is 9, which is good.\n\nThe condition is only that at time t1 + H -1=11, y=9, regardless of what I do after, but since the sequence includes up to a_{t1 + H -1}, I need to specify an action at time 11 as well, but it doesn't matter for reaching, as long as at that time I am at 9.\n\nBut in this case, at time 11, I am at y=9, and I can take S, for example.\n\nBut the key point is that when I move to y=9, at time 11, I am on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut is there any issue with the row I'm leaving or something? No, collision is only checked on the row I am on at that turn.\n\nWhen I am at y=8 at time 10, I need to check if there is collision at time 10 on y=8.\n\nAt each turn, for the position I am at that turn, I check for collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo at time t=10, I am at y=8, so I need to ensure that on freeway 8 at time 10, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y=9 at time 11, I need to ensure no collision, but y=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nSo the only potential issue is at time 10 on y=8.\n\nSo I need to check if at time 10, on freeway 8, there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nNow, let's look at the car state at turn t1=10.\n\nFor freeway 8, there is a car: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, which I think is moving left, so decreasing x, I assume.\n\nThe span is given as head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and it moves left, so at time t, span is [h - s(t - t1), τ - s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t1=10.\n\nFor car on freeway k, at turn t1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t1, span is:\n\nFor left-moving (I assume d=left means moving left): Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 8: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nNow, at time T, collision if 0 in Span(T) for that freeway.\n\nAt time t=10, T=10, T - t1 =0, so Span(10) = [h, τ] for left-moving? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving at T=t1: Span(t1) = [h, τ] as given.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8, car: head h=-48, tail τ=-25, direction left.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nAt T=10, T-t1=0, Span(10) = [h, τ] = [-48, -25]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-48, -25]? -48 to -25, all negative, 0 is greater than -25, not in this interval. Since it's a closed interval, I assume, but -25 < 0, so 0 not in [ -48, -25], so at time 10, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nTherefore, at time 10, I can take action U, then at time 11, y=9, safe.\n\nThen for H=2, actions: at t=10: U, and at t=11: say S, but since at time t=11, I am at y=9, and I need to specify action for t=11 as well? For the sequence.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10 +2 -1=11, so I need to specify action at t=11.\n\nBut whatever action I take, position at time 11 is already 9, and I can take S, for example, to stay, or U or D, but y=9, if I go up, y=10 not possible, since y in [0,9], so Δy=0 if I try to go up or down from boundary, I think.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and I go U, y_{t+1} should be min(9+1,9)=9, I think it stays, similarly for down at 0.\n\nBut in this case, at time 11, I am at y=9, I can take S or U or D, but D would go down to 8, which is not desired, but since the goal is to be at y=9 at time 11, and I am there, it's fine, I can take S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output actions for t=10 and t=11.\n\nBut the minimal H might be less? H=2 seems minimal because I need to reach at time 11.\n\nCould I reach at time 10? At time 10 I am at y=8, not 9, so I need at least to time 11.\n\nH=1 would mean only action at t=10, but then at time t1 + H -1=10, position 8≠9.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut in this case, with action U at t=10, I reach at time 11.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 at time 10? We checked, no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nAt T=10, Span=[-48, -25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, when I take U at t=10, at time 11, I am on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut the car state has multiple freeways, but since I only care about the rows I am on, at the times I am on them.\n\nAt time 10, I am on y=8, so only check y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt time 11, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at time 11.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at time 10, on y=8, is there a car coming that might affect, but no, collision is only at the specific time and row.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn, so for example, when I take U at t=10, during the move, I might be between rows, but I think the collision is discrete, only at the grid points at each turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, for moving to y=9, at turn T=10, I am on y=8, so I only care about cars on y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=11, on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let me check if at time 11, on y=9, but no cars, so ok.\n\nPerhaps I should look at other freeways, but I don't think so.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 7 and others, but I am not on them at relevant times.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list all cars at time t=10.\n\nBut I only need for the rows I visit.\n\nIn this direct path, I only visit y=8 at t=10 and y=9 at t=11.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\ny=8 at t=10: car with span [-48,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo I think I can go directly.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and cars are on x-axis, but since player is always at x=0, I only care if 0 is in the car span at that time.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, at t=10, span [-48,-25], min -48, max -25, both negative, 0 not in between, so no.\n\nPerhaps I should check if for other times, but I don't need.\n\nMaybe the car is moving, and at some future time it might be at 0, but at t=10 it's not, and I'm only at y=8 at t=10, so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, when I leave, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's possible in H=2 with actions: U at t=10, and then at t=11, since I need to specify an action, I can put S.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to output for turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nBut in this case, for H=2.\n\nBut is H minimal? H=2.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but at t=10 I'm at 8, so I cannot be at 9 at t=10, so H=2 is minimal.\n\nUnless I start at 9, but I start at 8.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,8) at turn t1=10, so at time 10, y=8.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, earliest is t=11.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states to make sure I didn't miss something.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t1=10.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, speed 24.\n\nAt T=10, span = [h - s(0), τ - s(0)] = [-48, -25] since T-t1=0.\n\n0 not in [-48,-25].\n\nNow, but let's see the head and tail: for left-moving, head is at more positive x? The notation: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nIn the problem: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 8, h=-48, τ=-25, and left direction.\n\nIf left-moving, and span [h,τ], with h and τ given.\n\nIn this case, h=-48, τ=-25, so if left-moving, the car is from x=-48 to x=-25, and since it's moving left, x decreasing.\n\nBut at position, x from -48 to -25, all negative, so at x=0, no car.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 5 has multiple cars, but I'm not on freeway 5 at this time.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no cars.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one move.\n\nBut let me see if there is a car on freeway 8 that might be at 0 at some time, but at t=10 it's not.\n\nFor example, when does the car reach x=0?\n\nThe car on freeway 8: left-moving, so position decreases.\n\nSpan at T: [ -48 - 24*(T-10), -25 - 24*(T-10) ]\n\nSet min or max to 0.\n\nFor example, the front is at h - s(T-t1) = -48 -24*(T-10)\n\nWhen this is 0? -48 -24(dt) =0, so 24 dt = -48, dt = -2, impossible.\n\nSince moving left, x decreasing, so from negative, it goes more negative, never to 0.\n\nSimilarly, the tail: -25 -24(dt) <0 for dt>=0.\n\nSo at no time does it cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on freeway 8, only one car.\n\nSo definitely safe at y=8 for all time, I think, but I only care at t=10.\n\nSo I think I can go directly.\n\nBut why is the player at y=8? And the goal is y=9, so immediately up.\n\nBut let me check if at time 11, when I arrive at y=9, but y=9 no cars, so ok.\n\nPerhaps I need to stay or something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the action at t=11, I need to specify, but since I'm at y=9, I can do S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, I output two actions.\n\nBut perhaps H could be 1, but no, as above.\n\nUnless I start at y=9, but I don't.\n\nSo I think H=2 with actions: at t=10: U, at t=11: S.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so Turn 10: U\n\n\"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\" for H=2, I have t=10 and t=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, so up to turn 11 action.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot? For example, if at time 10 on y=8 there was a car at 0, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nBut direction left, and head at -48, tail at -25? That seems odd.\n\nFor left-moving, if head is at h, and moving left, typically head is the front, so if moving left, front should be at higher x, but here h=-48, τ=-25, -48 < -25, so if x decreases left, -48 is left of -25.\n\nAssume x-axis, increasing to the right.\n\nSo x=-48 is left, x=-25 is right of -48.\n\nSo if a car is left-moving, direction left, decreasing x.\n\nThen at position, if head is at h, and tail at τ, for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be at the left end, I think.\n\nBut in the span, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" for left-moving.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8, [h, τ] = [-48, -25], so from x=-48 to x=-25, so the car occupies from left to right, but since moving left, the left end is the head.\n\nAt time t1, span [h, τ] = [-48, -25], so min x = -48, max x = -25.\n\nThen when moving left, both decrease.\n\nAt time T, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-48 -24 dt, -25 -24 dt], with dt=T-t1.\n\nFor dt=0, [-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, both decrease, so the interval moves left, always negative, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, I think no issue.\n\nBut just to be complete, let's see if on other rows there are cars that might be at 0 at some time, but since I'm not on those rows at those times, it doesn't matter.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, there are cars, but I'm not on freeway 5.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=8, and I go to y=9 directly.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway, but safe at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through other rows, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24) same as 8? No, freeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nBut I'm not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: (-24, -35, right, 4) and (40, 29, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h]? In the rule: \"right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the problem: \"right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nSo for this car, τ=-35, h=-24? But it says (head h, tail τ) in the table.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 6, first car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right.\n\nThen Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (40, 29, right, 4)? Head 40, tail 29, but if tail τ=29, head h=40, and right-moving, Span = [τ, h] = [29,40]\n\nBut at time t=10, for freeway 6, cars at [-35,-24] and [29,40], so around x=0, from -35 to -24 and 29 to 40, so x=0 not covered, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor first car: head 12, tail 1, so Span = [τ, h] = [1,12] since right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, second: head 48, tail 37, Span [37,48]\n\nThird: head -30, tail -41, Span [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nAll not covering 0 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-8,-19,right,4) head -8, tail -19, direction right, so Span = [τ, h] = [-19, -8]\n\nNot covering 0.\n\nFreeway 3: similar, (-8,-19,right,4), same as above, Span [-19,-8]\n\nFreeway 2: (48,1,right,48), head 48, tail 1, right, Span [1,48]\n\nAt t=10, [1,48], x=0 not in, since min 1>0.\n\nFreeway 1: same, (48,1,right,48), Span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-25,left,24), left-moving, Span [h,τ] = [-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nAll safe at t=10 for their positions.\n\nBut I only care about y=8 at t=10.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2, with actions: at t=10: U, and at t=11: S (or anything, but S to stay).\n\nIn the sequence, for t=11, since I am at y=9, and I need to output an action, but the position at t=11 is 9, so I can take S.\n\nIf I take U, y would stay 9, same.\n\nBut to be safe, take S.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U Turn 11: S }\n\nBut is that all?\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, I think I just need the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, it shows the turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but in the sequence, H is implied.\n\nIn the box, it has the actions.\n\nBut let me see.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nFor H=2, two lines.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 11, after action S, y_{12}=9, but at time t1 + H -1=11, y_{11}=9, which is good.\n\ny_{11} is position at time 11, after action at time 10.\n\nAt time 11, I take action, which affects y_{12}, but y_{11} is already set.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for minimal H, I can have H=2 with only moving up.\n\nBut I think it's correct.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might be too straightforward? Maybe I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-25,left,24)\n\nAt t=10, span [-48,-25], not at 0.\n\nPerhaps the direction: left, and head at -48, but if moving left, and head is at more negative, so it's moving away from 0.\n\nSimilarly, all cars seem away.\n\nFreeway 5 has a car from 1 to 12, but that's on y=5, not y=8.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nPerhaps at time 11, when I am at y=9, but y=9 no cars, so ok.\n\nAnother point: the goal is to reach (0,9), and it has no cars, so once there, I'm safe.\n\nSo I think H=2 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it with H=1, but impossible, as y_{10}=8.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, actions at t=10 and t=11.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one action, but H=2 includes the action to move and then a dummy, but it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, after action U at t=10, at time 11 I am at 9, so I don't need to act, but the sequence requires actions up to t1+H-1, which is t=11 for H=2.\n\nSo I must specify an action at t=11.\n\nI can specify S.\n\nIf I specify U at t=11, y_{12}= min(10,9)=9, still at 9.\n\nOr D, y_{12}=8, but at time t=11, position is 9, which is the goal, so it's ok, but to stay, S is better.\n\nBut for minimal turns, since I reach at t=11, and H=2, it's fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Taking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 10 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- Collision is checked at each turn for the freeway corresponding to the player's position at that turn.\n- **At turn 10 (position \\(y = 8\\)):**  \n  Freeway 8 has one car: \\((-48, -25, \\text{left}, 24)\\).  \n  For left-moving cars, the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([h - s(T - t_1), \\tau - s(T - t_1)]\\).  \n  At \\(T = 10\\) (since \\(t_1 = 10\\)), \\(T - t_1 = 0\\), so the span is \\([-48, -25]\\).  \n  Since \\(0 \\notin [-48, -25]\\), no collision occurs at turn 10.\n- **At turn 11 (position \\(y = 9\\)):**  \n  Freeway \\(y = 9\\) has no cars (as freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), so no collision is possible.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, satisfying the goal position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\). Solving \\(10 + H - 1 = 11\\) gives \\(H = 2\\).\n- After reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, the action at turn 11 can be \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as \\(y_{12}\\) will still be 9 (since \\(y\\) is bounded between 0 and 9).\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 2, with the sequence of actions:\n- At turn 10: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11).\n- At turn 11: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is already achieved.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 10, on freeway 8, no car spans \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 11, on freeway 9 (no cars), no collision possible.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U Turn 11: S }",
