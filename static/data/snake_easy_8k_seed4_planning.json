        "thinking": "<think>First, the current turn is t1 = 0. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: only one segment, the head at (3,3). Since it's a single segment, it's just the head, and there's no body or tail yet. Head direction is L (left), so it's moving left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and life span is 10 for each, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival. Since the snake has only one segment, eating any food will make it grow to length 2.\n\nImportant rule: Food can spawn under the snake's body, but here, the snake is only at (3,3), and no food is under it. The food at (2,3) is adjacent to the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: Since direction is left, I can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is left, so opposite is right, so I cannot move right. I can move up, down, or continue left.\n\nAvailable moves from (3,3):\n\n- Left: to (2,3)\n\n- Up: to (3,4)\n\n- Down: to (3,2)\n\nNow, check walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so all these moves are within bounds except if I go to x=0 or y=0, but (2,3) is x=2, y=3, fine; (3,4) x=3,y=4; (3,2) x=3,y=2, all fine. Internal obstacle at (3,6), but that's not in the way now.\n\nFood at (2,3) is exactly where moving left would go. If I move left to (2,3), I eat the food there.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, eating food will add a segment, so snake becomes two segments: head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3), I assume. After eating, the snake grows, so new head at food position, and tail stays where it was, but since it was only head, now head moves to food, and tail is added at previous position.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake eats, it grows, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, but since it was length 1, after eating, head is at new position, and tail is at old head position.\n\nBut in this case, if I move to (2,3), which has food, I eat it, so snake becomes: head at (2,3), and body segment at (3,3). Length 2.\n\nNow, the food at (2,3) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nOther food: (3,5) and (6,6).\n\nLife span: all have life span 10, starting from turn 0. After each turn, life span decreases by 1, so they disappear when life span reaches 0.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, no food under tail or anything yet.\n\nSince snake is short, it might be safe.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nMoving to (2,3) directly eats the food, which is good, +1 score, and snake grows.\n\nBut is there risk? Currently, no immediate danger.\n\nI could move up or down to avoid eating immediately, but that might not be necessary.\n\nLet's consider options.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,3) and eat food.\n\nThen turn 0: head at (2,3), direction left (since I moved left, new direction is left).\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nFood left: (3,5), (6,6), both with life span 9 now? Turn 0 is current, after move, it's turn 1, I think.\n\nClarify turn progression.\n\nCurrent state is turn t1=0. I need to output actions starting from turn t1=0.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" so for turn 0, I output an action.\n\nAfter that action, the state changes for turn 1, and so on.\n\nAfter I move on turn 0, it becomes turn 1, and food life span decreases.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 0, life span is 10. After turn 0 action, it decreases to 9, and so on, disappearing when it reaches 0.\n\nIn the food list, it's given at turn 0.\n\nAfter I move, for the next turn, life span decreases.\n\nBut for the action on turn 0, I need to decide.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3) on turn 0, I eat the food at (2,3), so it's consumed, removed. Snake now: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). Direction: since I moved left, new head direction is left.\n\nNow, for turn 1, possible moves from (2,3): left, up, down, but not right (opposite of left).\n\n- Left: to (1,3)\n\n- Up: to (2,4)\n\n- Down: to (2,2)\n\nNo walls or obstacles nearby yet.\n\nFood: (3,5) at (3,5), which is one step right and two up? From (2,3), (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, so not adjacent.\n\n(2,3) to (3,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (1,3), (3,3), (2,4), (2,2). (3,3) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there. Moving to (3,3) would be body collision.\n\nAvailable moves: (1,3), (2,4), (2,2)\n\n(3,3) is body, so cannot move there.\n\n(2,4) and (2,2) are free, I assume, unless walls, but no walls there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), not relevant.\n\nFood at (3,5) is at (3,5), which is adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), etc. But from (2,3), not directly reachable.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) far away.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 0, say I move up to (3,4) or down to (3,2).\n\nBut moving to (2,3) seems efficient since it's right there and positive food.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere's food at (3,5), which is above, and (6,6) to the right.\n\nAlso, snake direction is left, so moving left might be natural.\n\nBut I need to consider the internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above.\n\n(3,6) is a wall cell, so I cannot move there.\n\nNow, to eat (3,5), I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFrom current position (3,3), I can move up to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can move left to (2,3) to eat that food first.\n\nOr move down to (3,2), but no food there, so that might waste a turn.\n\nSince all food has life span 10, I have time, but I should eat when possible to grow and score.\n\nBut growing might increase risk later, but now it's small.\n\nAlso, with only one segment, no body collision risk.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake length 2, then I need to be careful not to hit myself.\n\nBut at length 2, as long as I don't reverse into myself, it's ok, since tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if head at (2,3), body at (3,3), if I move right to (3,3), that would be collision, but since tail is at (3,3), and if I move to (3,3), head goes to where body is, collision.\n\nBut if I move away, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3), up to (2,4), or down to (2,2), all safe since body is at (3,3), not adjacent except (3,3) which is occupied.\n\n(3,3) is adjacent but occupied, so I can't move there.\n\nOther directions are free.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (3,5).\n\nTo eat (3,5), from (3,3), I can go up directly: move up to (3,4) on turn 0, then on turn 1 move up to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left first to (2,3), then from there, to reach (3,5), I need to go right and up, but from (2,3), moving right to (3,3) is into body, not possible, so I have to go left, up, or down, then loop around.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I could go up to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then up to (3,5), which takes multiple turns.\n\nWhereas from (3,3), I can go directly to (3,4) then to (3,5) in two turns to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (2,3) is immediate.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is farther, at (6,6), from (3,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut with walls, etc.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might block access to (3,5)? (3,5) is at y=5, (3,6) is wall, so (3,5) is accessible, but I cannot go to (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to adjacent cells except (3,6).\n\nBut for now, it's fine.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate a few moves.\n\nAlso, prioritize survival.\n\nCurrently, no immediate threat.\n\nLet me list possible actions for turn 0:\n\n- Left to (2,3): eat food, score +1, snake grows to length 2, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\n- Up to (3,4): no food, snake still length 1, positions [(3,4)]\n\n- Down to (3,2): no food, length 1, positions [(3,2)]\n\nNow, if I go up to (3,4), then on turn 1, from (3,4), I can move to (3,5) to eat food, since (3,5) has food.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction: if I moved up from (3,3), new direction up, so I can move up, left, right, not down (opposite).\n\n- Up to (3,5): eat food\n\n- Left to (2,4)\n\n- Right to (4,4)\n\n- Down not possible (instant reverse)\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (3,2) on turn 0, then from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (2,2) or (4,2), no food directly, and food at (3,5) is farther.\n\nGoing down seems worse because no food and I move away from the other foods.\n\n(3,5) is above, (6,6) is northeast, so down is away.\n\nSimilarly, moving left eats immediately, moving up sets up to eat (3,5) next.\n\nMoving down delays and might not be efficient.\n\nSo between left and up, which is better?\n\nMoving left to (2,3) eats one food now, but then I need to go back to get (3,5), which from (2,3) I cannot go directly to (3,5) because (3,3) is body, so I have to go around, e.g., to (2,4) then (3,4) then (3,5), taking three turns to eat (3,5) after that.\n\nSequence if move left on turn 0:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), eat food at (2,3), snake: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), cannot go right (to body), so go U to (2,4) or D to (2,2) or L to (1,3). Say I go U to (2,4), no food, snake: head (2,4), body (2,3) and (3,3)? After move, tail moves? When snake moves, if no eat, head moves, tail moves forward, so positions update.\n\nImportant: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays.\n\nIn this case, on turn 0, I ate, so snake grew to [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nOn turn 1, if I move without eating, say to (2,4), then head moves to (2,4), and tail (the last segment) is removed, so snake becomes [(2,4)] only? No.\n\nSnake positions: after eating on turn 0, positions are [head (2,3), body (3,3)] so two segments.\n\nWhen I move to (2,4) on turn 1, since no eat, head moves to (2,4), and tail (3,3) is removed, so snake becomes [(2,4)] only, length 1 again? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding.\n\nStandard snake: when snake eats, it grows, so length increases.\n\nWhen it doesn't eat, it moves forward, so head moves to new cell, tail end is removed, so positions shift.\n\nIn this case:\n\nStart turn 0: snake [(3,3)] length 1.\n\nAction: move left to (2,3), which has food, so eat, grow: snake now [(2,3), (3,3)] head at (2,3), tail at (3,3). Length 2.\n\nTurn 1: I move, say, up to (2,4). (2,4) has no food, so no eat, so head moves to (2,4), tail is removed from (3,3), so snake becomes [(2,4)] only? But that would mean the body disappeared, which is not right.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake body shifts; the segment that was tail is gone, and the new head position is added.\n\nFor example, positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to new cell D, no food: new positions [D, A, B], so tail C is removed.\n\nIf move to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C], so new segment added at head, tail remains.\n\nIn the case of length 1: positions [H]\n\nMove to new cell N, no food: new positions [N], so still length 1, but head moved.\n\nIf eat, move to N with food: new positions [N, H], so length 2, head N, tail H.\n\nIn turn 0: move to (2,3) with food, so snake becomes [(2,3), (3,3)] head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 1: move up to (2,4), no food there, so head moves to (2,4), tail (3,3) is removed, so snake becomes [(2,4)] only, length 1 again.\n\nOh, so since I didn't eat, the tail is removed, and since it was only two segments, now only head at (2,4).\n\nBut that means the snake didn't grow permanently; only when it eats it grows.\n\nIn snake game, eating food increases length, so the growth is permanent until you eat again to grow more.\n\nBut when you don't eat, the length stays the same, and you move.\n\nIn this case, on turn 1, after moving to (2,4) without eating, the snake should be length 2? No.\n\nLet's clarify the rules.\n\nFrom the core rules: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so it grows by one segment.\n\nWhen not eating, length unchanged.\n\nIn movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the last cell is vacated.\n\nFor example, snake of length L: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1}] with P0 head.\n\nAfter move to new cell N, no eat: new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-2}], so the last position P_{L-1} is removed.\n\nLength remains L.\n\nIf eat, new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-1}], length L+1.\n\nIn the initial case, turn 0: snake length 1, position [(3,3)]\n\nMove to (2,3) with food: eat, so new positions [(2,3), (3,3)], length 2.\n\nNow turn 1: move to (2,4), no food, so head moves to (2,4), and the tail (3,3) is removed, so new positions [(2,4)], but that's length 1, which is wrong because length should be 2.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nIf length is 2, positions [H, T].\n\nMove to N no eat: new head at N, the body becomes N and H, so positions [N, H], tail T is removed. So from [H,T] to [N,H], so the tail moved from T to H, and head to N.\n\nIn this case, from [(2,3), (3,3)] move to (2,4) no eat: head to (2,4), tail (3,3) removed, new positions [(2,4), (2,3)] because the body segment at (2,3) is now the tail.\n\nPositions: before move, head (2,3), tail (3,3).\n\nAfter moving head to (2,4), the tail moves forward to the previous head position, so new head (2,4), new tail is the position that was head, (2,3), so positions [(2,4), (2,3)] with head at (2,4), tail at (2,3).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten, it would be different.\n\nBut in this case, no eat, so snake now [(2,4), (2,3)].\n\nThen from here, I can move, etc.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nIf I move left on turn 0 to (2,3), eat food, snake: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen on turn 1, I need to move to avoid body. From (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), not R to (3,3) (body).\n\nSay I go U to (2,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail moves to (2,3), so positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nNow, the food at (3,5) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nTo eat (3,5), I need to go to it.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move to (2,5), (1,4), (3,4), or (2,3) but (2,3) is body, so not.\n\n(3,4) is free, I assume.\n\nMove to (3,4) on turn 2, then to (3,5) on turn 3 to eat.\n\nSo from turn 0 to turn 3, I eat one food at (2,3) and one at (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nTurn 0: eat (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move to (2,4) no eat\n\nTurn 2: move to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,5) eat (3,5)\n\nScore 2.\n\nIf on turn 0 I move up to (3,4) instead.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), no food, snake still length 1, positions [(3,4)] (since no eat, moved from (3,3) to (3,4), tail removed, but length 1, so just head at (3,4))\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) to eat food, since (3,5) has food.\n\nSo turn 1: move U to (3,5), eat, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen I have eaten (3,5) on turn 1.\n\nCompared to previous, where I ate (2,3) on turn 0 and (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nHere, I ate (3,5) on turn 1, but not (2,3) yet.\n\n(2,3) food is still there, but life span decreasing.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), snake at [(3,5), (3,4)], head at (3,5), direction up.\n\nThen to eat (2,3), I need to go down and left.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not D if direction is up? Direction is up, so cannot move down (instant reverse).\n\nSo from (3,5), direction up, can move U, L, R, not D.\n\n- U to (3,6): but (3,6) is wall, internal obstacle, cannot move there.\n\n- L to (2,5)\n\n- R to (4,5)\n\n- D not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is down-left, but I cannot go directly down.\n\nSo I need to go left to (2,5), then down to (2,4), then down to (2,3), but (2,3) has food, but when I go to (2,3), I eat it.\n\nBut from (3,5), move L to (2,5) on turn 2, no food, snake moves to [(2,5), (3,5)]? After move no eat: head to (2,5), tail to (3,5), positions [(2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5), can move to (2,4), (1,5), (3,5) but (3,5) is body, so not, or (2,6), etc.\n\nMove D to (2,4), no food, snake [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nThen turn 4: move D to (2,3), which has food, eat, so snake grows to [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)] or something.\n\nBut I ate (2,3) on turn 4.\n\nIn this scenario, I ate (3,5) on turn 1 and (2,3) on turn 4.\n\nCompared to first scenario: ate (2,3) on turn 0 and (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nBoth have two foods eaten by turn 4 or so, but in first case, first food earlier.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,6) is still there, life span 10, decreasing.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nNow, another option: if I move down on turn 0, to (3,2), no food, then I have to come back to eat food, wasting turns.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move D to (3,2), no eat, snake at (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty now? From (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), which was previous position, but no food, so snake moves to (3,3), but length 1, so just head.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can eat (2,3) or go to (3,4) for (3,5).\n\nBut it took extra turns to go down and back, so inefficient.\n\nSo moving down is bad.\n\nBetween moving left or up on turn 0.\n\nMoving left to (2,3) eats immediately, then I can go to (3,5) via (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nMoving up to (3,4) then to (3,5) eats (3,5) on turn 1, then I can go to (2,3) later.\n\nBut in the up-first case, when I go to eat (2,3), from (3,5) after eating, I have to go left to (2,5), then down to (2,4), then to (2,3), which takes more turns.\n\nIn the left-first case, from (2,3) after eating, I go to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5), which is similar.\n\nBut in left-first, I ate first food on turn 0, second on turn 3.\n\nIn up-first, first food on turn 1, second on turn 4.\n\nSo left-first has earlier score and same number of moves for second food? Turn 3 vs turn 4.\n\nLeft-first: turn 0 eat (2,3), turn 3 eat (3,5)\n\nUp-first: turn 1 eat (3,5), turn 4 eat (2,3)\n\nSo left-first gets the first point earlier, and both have two points by turn 3 or 4.\n\nBut turn 3 for left-first, turn 4 for up-first, so left-first is slightly better for score timing.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6), which I might want to eat later.\n\nBut life span 10, so I have time.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect movement in the upper area.\n\nBut for now, not critical.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: not applicable yet.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival and the grid.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders and one obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is a wall, so row y=6, x=3 is blocked.\n\nThis might make the upper row narrower.\n\nFor example, to go to (3,5), I can, but from (3,5), I cannot go up to (3,6), so I have to go left, right, or down.\n\nSimilarly, other areas.\n\nBut since snake is small, I can navigate.\n\nNow, to maximize, I should also consider eating (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (3,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut with head direction left, moving right is not allowed on next turn, since opposite.\n\nOn turn 0, I cannot move right because direction is left.\n\nSo I have to move left, up, or down first.\n\nThen on later turns, I can change direction.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,4) on turn 0, then to (3,5) on turn 1, then from (3,5), I can move right to (4,5), etc., towards (6,6).\n\nSimilarly from other positions.\n\nBut let's plan for 5 turns.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the AI has to decide based on state, but in this case, I need to provide a sequence for turns 0 to some number.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but I think for the output, I need to specify actions for the current turn and a few ahead, but it might be state-dependent.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for the decision, but the output should be the action for turn t1, and then for t1+1, etc., up to how many? It doesn't specify, but since it's a sequence, I should provide a few actions, say for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state might change with food disappearing, so I need to be flexible, but for now, with life span 10, all food lasts at least 10 turns, so I can plan to eat them.\n\nLife span 10 at turn 0, so after 10 turns, it disappears, but since countdown includes current, after turn 9, it might disappear, but let's see.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it disappears when L reaches 0.\n\nAfter each turn, L decreases by 1.\n\nAt turn 0, L=10, after turn 0 action, L=9 for the next state.\n\nIt disappears when L=0 after decrease.\n\nBut for planning, with L=10, I have 10 turns to eat it.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nPerhaps moving left to eat (2,3) immediately is good, then I can head towards (3,5).\n\nBut from (2,3) after eating, if I go to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5).\n\nOn turn 2, at (3,4), I can go to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nBut (3,4) has no food, so no issue.\n\nThen after eating (3,5), snake at [(3,5), (3,4)] or something.\n\nThen I can go to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (3,5), I need to go right and up, but y=5 to y=6, but (3,6) is wall, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move right to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nOr shorter paths.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,5) first, then from there to (2,3) is left and down, but as before, takes turns.\n\nBut (2,3) and (3,5) are both close, so I should eat both asap.\n\nThe food at (6,6) is farther, so I can eat it later.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat the close ones first.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (2,3) is adjacent to the current head, and if I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later, but no rush.\n\nBut if I move away, it might take more turns to come back.\n\nIn the up-first scenario, when I go to eat (2,3) from (3,5), it takes several turns, and during that, the life span decreases, but with 10 turns, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's calculate the score over time.\n\nAssume I want to eat all three foods.\n\nFirst, with left-first approach:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), eat (2,3), score=1, snake: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4), no eat, snake: [(2,4), (2,3)]  (head to (2,4), tail to (2,3))\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4), no eat, snake: [(3,4), (2,4)]  (since from (2,4) to (3,4), head (3,4), tail (2,4))\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,5), eat (3,5), score=2, snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]? After eat, head to (3,5), new segment, so positions [(3,5), (3,4)] with (2,4) tail? Let's see: before move, positions [(3,4), (2,4)], head (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nMove to (3,5) with food, so head to (3,5), new segment added, so positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, from here, to go to (6,6).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), direction up (since moved up), can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (3,6) wall, cannot.\n\nL to (2,5)\n\nR to (4,5)\n\nSay move R to (4,5), no food, snake: head to (4,5), tail removed, so positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]? After move no eat: head to (4,5), the body: previous head (3,4) becomes body, and (3,5) was body, so positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] with head (4,5), tail (3,4)\n\nBefore: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] head (3,5), segments.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat: head to (4,5), the segment that was tail (2,4) is removed, and the new positions are [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]? The segments shift: the new head is (4,5), the previous head (3,5) is now the first body, then (3,4) is next, and (2,4) is gone.\n\nPositions: old [H: (3,5), B1: (3,4), T: (2,4)]\n\nMove to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), new body: H becomes B1, so B1: (3,5), then B2: (3,4), but (2,4) is tail, removed, so positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] with head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nThen turn 5: move to (5,5) or something towards (6,6).\n\nBut I need to output only for a few turns, not necessarily to eat all.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 0 action.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I should choose the action that sets up for future.\n\nAnother thing: in the up-first approach, when I go to eat (2,3) later, the snake might be longer, so more risk, but now it's short.\n\nBut in this case, with length 3, going to (2,3) from (3,5) area might be tight.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCells: x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\n(2,3) is at bottom-left area, (3,5) center-top, (6,6) top-right.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,3), I need to go to (2,5) or (2,4) then to (2,3), but (2,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I approach, it should be free.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, moving left to eat (2,3) is fine.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,6). If I eat it later, it's ok.\n\nBut there might be a better path.\n\nAnother idea: since the snake is at (3,3), and food at (2,3) and (3,5), I can eat (2,3) first, then go up to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5), as before.\n\nOr, I can move up to (3,4) on turn 0, then to (3,5) on turn 1, then from (3,5) move left to (2,5), then down to (2,4), then to (2,3) on turn 4.\n\nBut in this case, when I move to (2,3) on turn 4, the snake is longer, and (2,3) is food, so I eat it, grow.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, when I move to (2,3) to eat, the tail is not necessarily adjacent.\n\nFor example, on turn 4, if I move to (2,3), and tail is at (2,5) or something, not adjacent.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut in terms of turns, eating (2,3) on turn 0 is earlier.\n\nAlso, by eating early, I grow earlier, which might allow me to reach other food faster or something, but not really, since movement speed is same.\n\nWith longer snake, I cover more, but for reaching (6,6), it might not help directly.\n\nI think moving left on turn 0 is reasonable.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so for example, from (3,5), I cannot go up, so I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go left, I can explore left side, but (2,3) is there.\n\nIf I go right, I can go to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), which is near the wall, x=7 is wall, so I need to be careful not to hit wall.\n\nBut ok.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should eat the closer foods first.\n\n(2,3) is very close, (3,5) is two steps away, (6,6) is farther.\n\nEuclidean distance: from (3,3) to (2,3) dist 1, to (3,5) dist 2, to (6,6) dist sqrt( (3)^2 + (3)^2 ) = sqrt(18)~4.24, so about 4-5 moves.\n\nSo eat (2,3) and (3,5) first, then (6,6).\n\nIn terms of action sequence, I need to output for turn 0, and then for future turns, but since the state changes, I should only output the action for turn 0, but the format says to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nLook at the answer format: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence, but it might be speculative.\n\nPerhaps for this case, I can provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the AI is playing, I need to decide the first action, and the sequence is based on that.\n\nBut for the output, I have to write a sequence.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll assume a path and output actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, move left to eat (2,3).\n\nThen for turn 1, move up to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2, move right to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3, move up to (3,5) to eat that food.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (3,5), move right to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5, move right to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify only for the turns I output.\n\nThe instruction doesn't say how many turns to output, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAnother thing: all food has value 1, so no negative food here.\n\nAlso, life span 10, so no urgency for (6,6).\n\nBut to be efficient, I can include it in the sequence.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll start with moving left.\n\nThen for subsequent actions, based on the path.\n\nBut to avoid being too long, I'll output for turns 0 to 4 or 5.\n\nNow, for the head direction: on turn 0, move left, so new direction left.\n\nTurn 1, from (2,3), I move up, so new direction up.\n\nThen turn 2, from (2,4) move right to (3,4), so direction right.\n\nTurn 3, from (3,4) move up to (3,5), direction up.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,5), move right to (4,5), direction right.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIf on turn 1 I move down instead, but down to (2,2) might not be good, as it goes away from food.\n\nSo up is better.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nNow, for the food at (6,6), I can eat it later, not in the first 5 turns.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, 9, turn 1,8, etc., so by turn 10 it disappears, but I have time.\n\nIn this sequence, by turn 4, I have eaten two foods, and on turn 5, I can head towards (6,6).\n\nBut for the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: not an issue here.\n\nAnother point: when I eat (3,5) on turn 3, the head is at (3,5), and if the tail were adjacent and had food, but here no food on tail.\n\nSo safe.\n\nI think moving left on turn 0 is the way to go.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial move.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving up first is better for some reason.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,4) on turn 0, then to (3,5) on turn 1, eat, then from (3,5) I can move right directly to (4,5) on turn 2, then to (5,5) on turn 3, to (6,5) on turn 4, to (6,6) on turn 5 to eat.\n\nThen I eat (3,5) on turn 1 and (6,6) on turn 5, but I missed (2,3), which is still there.\n\nThen I need to go back to eat (2,3), which from (6,6) is far, and life span decreases.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, after eating (6,6), snake at [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc.], then to go to (2,3), it takes many turns, and (2,3) life span was 10 at turn 0, so at turn 5, life span 5 left, but I can reach it.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,3), I need to go left and down, about 4 left and 3 down, 7 moves, but with obstacles, but I can do it within 5 turns? From turn 6 to 10, but life span at turn 5 is 5 (since decreased each turn), so I have until turn 9 to eat it, as at turn 10 it disappears if not eaten.\n\nLife span decreases after each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0, L=9\n\nAfter turn 1, L=8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, L=10-k-1? Let's define.\n\nAt the start of turn t, or after action.\n\nThe state is given at turn t1=0, with food life span.\n\nAfter the action of turn t, life span decreases by 1 for the next state.\n\nSo for food at turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0 action, for turn 1 state, L=9.\n\nAfter turn 1 action, for turn 2 state, L=8.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9 action, for turn 10 state, L=0, so it disappears.\n\nSo the food can be eaten up to turn 9, I think.\n\nTo be eaten, on turn t, when I move to it, before life span decrease.\n\nFor example, on turn t, if I move to a food cell with L>0, I eat it, then it is consumed before decrease.\n\nThen after that, for the next turn, life span of other food decreases.\n\nBut for a specific food, if L=1 at turn t, I can eat it on turn t, then on turn t+1 it would be gone anyway.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn t action, L=0, gone.\n\nSo to eat, I need to be on the cell on or before turn when L>0.\n\nFor (2,3), L=10 at turn 0, so I can eat it from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the up-first then right scenario, I eat (3,5) on turn 1, (6,6) on turn 5, then I need to go to (2,3), which is at (2,3), from (6,6) on turn 5, I can go left to (5,6), (4,6), etc., but y=6, and (3,6) is wall, so I have to go down or something.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), move left to (5,6), then to (4,6), but (3,6) wall, so to (4,6), then I can move down to (4,5), then left to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not, but in this case, after eating (3,5) on turn 1, I moved away, so (3,5) is free later.\n\nBut it takes many turns to go to (2,3).\n\nWhereas in the left-first approach, I eat both close foods by turn 3, then I can go to (6,6) directly.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) on turn 3, I can go right to (4,5) turn 4, (5,5) turn 5, (6,5) turn 6, (6,6) turn 7, eat on turn 7.\n\nAnd (6,6) life span at turn 0 is 10, so at turn 7, it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, in the other approach, I eat (6,6) on turn 5 but (2,3) on later turn.\n\nBut (2,3) is closer to start, so eating it early is better.\n\nIn terms of score, both get three foods, but in left-first, I have score earlier.\n\nAlso, with smaller snake, less risk when moving.\n\nSo I think moving left on turn 0 is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 2: R (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 3: U (to (3,5) and eat)\n\nNow, for turn 4, from (3,5), I need to move, say R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: R to (5,5)\n\nBut I need to output 5 actions or so.\n\nSince the format might expect actions for multiple turns, I'll do up to turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut turn 3 is U to (3,5), which is the fourth action? Turns start from 0.\n\nTurn 0, turn 1, turn 2, turn 3, that's four actions.\n\nI can add turn 4.\n\nAfter turn 3, at (3,5), after eating, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] as before.\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,5), no food, so snake moves: head to (4,5), tail (2,4) removed, positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen turn 5: move to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut for output, I'll include turn 4.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, output 5 actions.\n\nSo actions for turn 0 to turn 4.\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nThen for turn 5, I can go to (5,5), but not in output.\n\nNow, to confirm, are there any risks?\n\nOn turn 2, moving to (3,4), is that safe? At that point, snake might be at [(2,4), (2,3)] or something, but from turn 1: after turn 0 L to (2,3) eat, snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: U to (2,4) no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3)]  (head to (2,4), tail to (2,3)? Positions: before move [(2,3), (3,3)] head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nMove U to (2,4) no eat: head to (2,4), tail removed, so new positions [(2,4), (2,3)] with head (2,4), tail (2,3)\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (3,4), no eat, head to (3,4), tail (2,3) removed, new positions [(3,4), (2,4)] head (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (3,5) eat, head to (3,5), new segment, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,5) no eat, head to (4,5), tail (2,4) removed, new positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nAll safe, no walls or collisions.\n\nThen towards (6,6).\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must think at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 0\\)) has the snake at position (3,3) with a head direction of left (L). Available food includes positive food at (2,3), (3,5), and (6,6), each with a value of +1 and a life span of 10 turns. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 0)**: Moving left (L) to (2,3) eats the food at (2,3) immediately, scoring +1 and increasing snake length to 2. This is efficient as (2,3) is adjacent and avoids wasting turns. The new head position is (2,3), with the tail at (3,3).\n- **Subsequent Actions (Turns 1-4)**:\n  - **Turn 1**: From (2,3), moving up (U) to (2,4) avoids the body segment at (3,3) and positions the snake closer to (3,5). No food is eaten, so the snake moves to [(2,4), (2,3)] with head direction up.\n  - **Turn 2**: From (2,4), moving right (R) to (3,4) continues toward (3,5) without eating, resulting in positions [(3,4), (2,4)] and head direction right.\n  - **Turn 3**: From (3,4), moving up (U) to (3,5) eats the food at (3,5), scoring another +1 and increasing length to 3. Positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] with head direction up.\n  - **Turn 4**: From (3,5), moving right (R) to (4,5) avoids the wall at (3,6) and heads toward (6,6). No food is eaten, so positions update to [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] with head direction right.\n- **Long-Term Survival (Beyond Turn 4)**: After turn 4, the snake should continue toward (6,6) (e.g., via (5,5) and (6,5)) to eat it before its life span expires. All food has sufficient life span (10 turns at start), so (6,6) can be eaten by turn 7–9 safely. The path avoids walls and body collisions, and the snake length remains manageable for navigation.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two high-value foods (at (2,3) and (3,5)) by turn 3, securing +2 points early. The third food (6,6) is targeted for later consumption.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No body collisions: Movements avoid existing body segments (e.g., not moving right from (2,3) on turn 1 to prevent collision with tail).\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: The internal obstacle at (3,6) is bypassed by not moving up from (3,5).\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here, as no food is under the tail.\n- **Efficiency**: Minimizes turns to reach nearby food first ((2,3) and (3,5)) before targeting distant (6,6). Moving down on turn 0 was rejected as it wastes turns and moves away from food.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 0 to 4):\nThe sequence below ensures the snake eats available food while maintaining safe paths for at least 5 turns. Actions are chosen based on the current state and projected future states.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 2: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 3: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right)\n}",

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so it has 8 turns left including turn 2. But since we're at turn 2, it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t, it has life_span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so not available next turn. If L=2, available this turn and next, gone after that.\n\nAt turn 2, life span 8 means it has 8 turns left, including turn 2, so it will be available from turn 2 to turn 9, and disappear at turn 10. Turn 2: countdown 8, turn 3: countdown 7, ..., turn 9: countdown 1, turn 10: countdown 0, gone. So yes, available until turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) value 1, life span 8, same thing.\n\n(6,4) value 1, life span 9, so available until turn 10 (since 2 + 9 - 1 = 10? Turn 2: L=9, turn 3: L=8, ..., turn 10: L=1, turn 11: L=0 gone. So available from turn 2 to turn 10 inclusive.\n\nAll food has value +1, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake: head (2,4), body (2,3), direction U. So possible moves: since direction is U, I can go U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Current head direction U, so moving up. Next move, I can go U (continue up), L (left), or R (right), but not D (down) because that's opposite.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nAvailable moves from (2,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (2,5). Is this valid? (2,5) is within bounds? x=2, y=5. Walls: x=0 and x=7, so x=2 is fine. y=0 and y=7, y=5 <7, so (2,5) should be empty? But need to check for body or obstacles.\n\nBody: snake is at (2,4) and (2,3), so (2,5) is not occupied. Obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, not (2,5). So (2,5) is free.\n\n- Left (L): to (1,4). x=1, y=4. Not wall, not body, not obstacle. Free.\n\n- Right (R): to (3,4). x=3, y=4. Not wall, not body. Obstacle is at (3,6), not (3,4), so free.\n\n- Down (D): not possible, opposite direction.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (3,5): value +1\n\n- (6,6): value +1\n\n- (6,4): value +1\n\nAll positive.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's see where the food is relative to the snake.\n\nSnake head at (2,4). Food at (3,5) is one step right and one up, so diagonally adjacent. To eat it, I need to move to (3,5).\n\nBut moving to (3,5) from (2,4) requires going right then up, or up then right? From (2,4), I can only move in one direction per turn.\n\nTo reach (3,5), I could go R to (3,4) first, then U to (3,5), but (3,5) might be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,4) is at same y, x=6, so from (2,4) it's 4 steps right, but with obstacles.\n\nFood at (6,6) is further.\n\nAlso, tail: since snake is only two segments, tail is at (2,3). After moving, if I don't eat, tail moves, so the body segment moves to where head was.\n\nImportant: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, tail moves away from current tail position, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n\nIf I eat, head moves to food, new tail grows, so tail stays, but since I eat, length increases.\n\nBut in this case, all food is +1, so eating increases length.\n\nNow, about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,3), which has no food on it. Food is at other positions. So no immediate danger.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here, body is only (2,3), and food is not there. (3,5), (6,6), (6,4) all not under snake.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list possible paths to food.\n\nClosest food is (3,5), at distance: from (2,4) to (3,5) is (1,1) difference, so Manhattan distance 2.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (2,4) is (4,0), distance 4.\n\n(6,6) is (4,2), distance 6.\n\nBut with obstacles and walls.\n\nAlso, life span: all have high life, 8 or 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSince grid is small, I should simulate possible moves.\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output should be for the next few actions? The format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to plan a sequence of moves, but since the state changes, I should decide the immediate action and have a plan.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for decision making, but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence for, say, 5 turns or something. But let's see the format example isn't given, but it says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\"\n\nI think I need to provide a sequence of actions for the next few turns, but how many? Since thinking ahead, maybe for 5 turns or until a food is eaten, but it's open.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan for at least 5 turns ahead in my mind, but output actions for, say, the next 3-5 turns or something. But let's see.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the immediate options.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (2,5)\n\nThen head at (2,5), body at (2,4) now? Positions: after move, if no eat, head to new, body follows, so snake becomes [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nDirection: since moved U, head direction becomes U.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5). (3,5) has food, so if I go R to (3,5), I eat it.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), which is free? Currently, no body or obstacle there.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on this turn, then next turn I can go R to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBut is that safe? After eating, snake grows to three segments: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nBut let's see risks.\n\n(3,5) is close to obstacle at (3,6), but not immediate issue.\n\nAlso, walls: y=7 is wall, so from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,6), so I cannot go to (3,6).\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: since head at (3,5), direction would be from (2,5) to (3,5), so direction R.\n\nThen moves: U (up to (3,6)) but (3,6) obstacle, not possible. D (down to (3,4)), L (left to (2,5)), but (2,5) is body? After moving to (3,5) and eating, snake is [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), segment (2,5), segment (2,4)\n\nSo (2,5) is body, so I cannot move L to (2,5), collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,4): is (3,4) free? Currently no, but after move, tail moves? When I move to (3,5) and eat, tail doesn't move, it stays, so body is at (2,5) and (2,4).\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows. So after eating at (3,5), snake becomes: head at (3,5), then the previous head was (2,5) now body, and previous body (2,4) now tail. So positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nNow from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): but (3,6) is obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\n- D to (3,4): (3,4) is empty? Currently, no food or anything, and not occupied, so possible.\n\n- L to (2,5): but (2,5) is occupied by body, collision, death.\n\n- R to (4,5): (4,5) is within bounds, x=4<7, y=5<7, no obstacle, should be free.\n\nSo possible moves: D or R.\n\nBut direction: since I moved R to (3,5), head direction is R, so I can go R (right), U (up) but U not possible, D (down), or L (left) but L not possible. So only R or D.\n\nNow, if I go D to (3,4), then head to (3,4), body follows: since I moved, and didn't eat, tail moves, so snake becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? When head moves to new position without eating, the tail moves off the previous tail.\n\nCurrent before move: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nHead moves to (3,4), no eat, so new head (3,4), then body segments move: the segment that was at (2,5) moves to where head was? Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions: head was (3,5), moves to (3,4). Then the first body segment (2,5) moves to where head was, (3,5). The tail (2,4) moves to where the first body was, (2,5).\n\nSo new snake: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen head direction from (3,5) to (3,4), so direction D.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5), head to (4,5), body to (3,5) and (2,5), so [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)], direction R.\n\nBut back to the point: if I move U to (2,5) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I can go R to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBut after that, from (3,5), I have limited moves: only D or R, since U blocked by obstacle, L blocked by body.\n\nIf I go D to (3,4), then I'm at (3,4) with body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to adjacent cells, but need to see.\n\n(3,4) has food? Food at (6,4) and (6,6), not at (3,4).\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, is this path good?\n\nBut I have other options.\n\nOption 2: Move Left to (1,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen head at (1,4), body at (2,4)? Snake: after move no eat, head to (1,4), body to (2,4), so [(1,4), (2,4)]\n\nDirection: moved L, so head direction L.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, not possible. R to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot. So only U or D.\n\nU to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n\nNot very promising, as no food nearby except perhaps later.\n\nFood at (3,5) is close, but moving away.\n\nOption 3: Move Right to (3,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen head at (3,4), body at (2,4), so [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nDirection: moved R, so head direction R.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), which has food, so I can eat it immediately on next turn if I go U.\n\nL to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, cannot.\n\nD to (3,3), y=3, not wall.\n\nR to (4,4), x=4<7.\n\nAlso, U to (3,5) is possible and has food.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I can go U to (3,5) and eat.\n\nSimilar to before, but from (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nAfter eating, snake: head at (3,5), body at (3,4), tail at (2,4)? Positions: before move to (3,5), snake was [(3,4), (2,4)], head moves to (3,5) eat, so new head (3,5), body segments: (3,4) remains, and tail grows, so snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nNow from (3,5), same as before: cannot go U to (3,6) obstacle, cannot go L to (2,5) but (2,5) is not occupied, let's see.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nSo (2,5) is empty? Yes, not occupied.\n\nBut to move to (2,5), from (3,5), it's left, so L.\n\nBut direction: since I moved U to (3,5), head direction U.\n\nThen possible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U to (3,6): obstacle, not possible\n\n- D to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, collision, cannot\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) is empty, possible\n\n- R to (4,5): possible\n\nSo L or R.\n\nIf L to (2,5), then head to (2,5), and since no eat, tail moves, body moves: head to (2,5), body (3,5) moves to where head was (3,5)? Standard: head moves to (2,5), then body segment at (3,5) moves to (3,5) — no, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nBefore move: snake [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nHead moves to (2,5), no eat.\n\nThen the first body segment (3,4) moves to where head was, (3,5)? No: the positions: the head was at (3,5), moving to (2,5). Then the segment that was behind head, at (3,4), moves to the head's previous position (3,5). Then the tail at (2,4) moves to where the first body was, (3,4).\n\nSo new snake: head (2,5), then (3,5), then (3,4)? Let's list:\n\n- Head new position: (2,5)\n\n- First body segment: moves to previous head position (3,5)\n\n- Second body segment (tail): moves to previous position of first body segment, which was (3,4)\n\nBut previous positions: head (3,5), body1 (3,4), body2 (2,4)\n\nAfter head moves to (2,5):\n\n- New head: (2,5)\n\n- Body1: moves to where head was: (3,5)\n\n- Body2: moves to where body1 was: (3,4)\n\nSo snake: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction from (3,5) to (2,5), so L.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5), head to (4,5), body to (3,5) and (3,4), so [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)], direction R.\n\nBut back to the decision.\n\nIf I move directly to (3,4) on turn 2, then U to (3,5) on turn 3 to eat, I have the same situation as before but from a different angle.\n\nIn both cases, when I eat (3,5), I end up at (3,5) with the snake body, and I have to move L or R.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) early might not be bad, but let's see other food.\n\nThere is food at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, same as current head y, but x=6.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (6,4) is 4 steps right, but there is an obstacle at (3,6), but not blocking directly.\n\nI could go towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is closer in y, but same row.\n\nLife span is long, so I can go for farther food later.\n\nBut thinking long-term survival, I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nCurrently, the grid has walls and one obstacle.\n\nAlso, with snake length 2, I have space.\n\nBut after eating, length 3, still ok.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: food can be under body, but not now.\n\nSo let's plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (3,5) immediately because after eating, I might get stuck in the top-right area with the obstacle.\n\nFor example, if I eat (3,5), and then I have to move L or R from (3,5).\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then I'm at (2,5) with body at (3,5) and (3,4) as above.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), D to (2,4) but (2,4) might be body or not.\n\nIn that state: snake [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction L (since moved from (3,5) to (2,5)).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (2,6): free?\n\n- D to (2,4): (2,4) is not occupied; in the snake, positions are (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), so (2,4) is free.\n\n- L to (1,5): free\n\n- R to (3,5): but (3,5) is body, cannot.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then head to (2,6), body follows: new head (2,6), body1 to (2,5), body2 to (3,5), tail at (3,4) moves to (3,5)? Positions before: head (2,5), body1 (3,5), body2 (3,4)\n\nHead moves to (2,6), no eat.\n\nThen body1 moves to (2,5), body2 moves to (3,5), and tail (3,4) moves to where body2 was? body2 was at (3,4), moves to (3,5)? Let's: after head move, new positions: head (2,6), then body1 to previous head position (2,5), body2 to previous body1 position (3,5). But body2 was at (3,4), which moves to the position of previous body1, which was (3,5).\n\nSo snake: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nAnd (3,4) is now free.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, not possible. D to (2,5) body, cannot. L to (1,6), R to (3,6) obstacle. Oh, all moves blocked? U wall, D body, L to (1,6) possible? x=1,y=6, not wall, no body, so possible. R to (3,6) obstacle, not possible.\n\nSo only L to (1,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck in the corner.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,5) I go D to (2,4), then head to (2,4), body to (2,5) and (3,5), so [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (2,4), direction D, can move L to (1,4), R to (3,4), U to (2,5) body cannot, D to (2,3) etc.\n\nBut not efficient.\n\nIf from (3,5) after eating, I go R to (4,5), then head to (4,5), body to (3,5) and (2,4) or something.\n\nEarlier: after eating at (3,5), snake [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]? No, in the first scenario when I moved from (2,4) to (2,5) then to (3,5), snake was [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen if I go R to (4,5), head to (4,5), body to (3,5) and (2,5)? New head (4,5), body1 to (3,5), body2 to (2,5), so [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) body cannot, R to (5,5).\n\nSo U, D, or R.\n\nThen I can go towards other food.\n\nBut food at (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4), then right to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is at (6,6).\n\nBut let's think about not eating (3,5) immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,4) first, since it's on the same row.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I go R to (3,4) on turn 2, but instead of going U to eat (3,5), I can go D or R to avoid eating now.\n\nFor example, on turn 2, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 3, from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4) instead of U.\n\nThen head to (4,4), body to (3,4), and tail at (2,4)? After move to (4,4) no eat, snake [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]? Before: at turn 2, after move to (3,4), snake [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nThen move R to (4,4), no eat, head to (4,4), body to (3,4), and tail (2,4) moves to (3,4)? Positions: head was (3,4) to (4,4), body was (2,4) moves to (3,4).\n\nSo snake [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nOnly two segments.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move to (5,4), (4,5), (4,3), etc.\n\nFood at (6,4) is at (6,4), so I can go right to (5,4) then (6,4).\n\nOn turn 4, from (4,4) go R to (5,4), then turn 5 go R to (6,4) and eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake length 3, head at (6,4), body at (5,4), tail at (4,4)? Positions: before eating, snake [(5,4), (4,4)] after moving to (5,4)? Let's track.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4), snake [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,4), no eat, snake [(4,4), (3,4)]  (tail moved off (2,4))\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,4), no eat, snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,4), eat food, so snake grows: head (6,4), body (5,4), and new tail, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow from (6,4), head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4) body cannot, R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, not possible.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nThen I can go to other food like (6,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) might expire or not.\n\nLife span: (3,5) has life span 8 from turn 2, so at turn 5, countdown 5, still available.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) has life span 8, available.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I go U to (6,5), then to (6,6) and eat.\n\nTurn 5: at (6,4) after eating, on turn 6 move U to (6,5), no eat (assuming no food), snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nThen turn 7 move U to (6,6), eat food, snake grows to 4 segments.\n\nBut (6,6) is food, so on turn 7 eat.\n\nBut after that, at (6,6), I can only move U or D, but y=6, U to (6,7) y=7 wall, not possible, D to (6,5) body, cannot, L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall not possible. So only L to (5,6).\n\nThen from (5,6), etc.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nSimilarly, if from (6,4) I go D to (6,3), then I can go down, but less food.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, I have the food at (3,5) which is closer.\n\nBut if I eat it early, I might have limited moves.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can eat multiple food.\n\nAnother idea: go for (6,4) first, as it's on the way, then to (6,6), but (6,6) is not on the way.\n\n(6,4) and (6,6) are both at x=6.\n\nBut let's list all food and plan a route.\n\nFood:\n\n- F1: (3,5) value 1, life 8, expires after turn 9 (available turns 2 to 9)\n\n- F2: (6,6) value 1, life 8, available turns 2 to 9\n\n- F3: (6,4) value 1, life 9, available turns 2 to 10\n\nCurrent turn 2.\n\nI can eat F3 on turn 5 as above, then F2 on turn 7 if I go up.\n\nBut at turn 5, when I eat F3 at (6,4), I am at (6,4), and F2 at (6,6) is two steps up, so I can go U to (6,5) on turn 6, then U to (6,6) on turn 7 and eat.\n\nThen on turn 7, after eating F2, snake at (6,6), length 4, but then I can only go L to (5,6), as U and R wall, D body.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move to other places.\n\nBut F1 at (3,5) is still available until turn 9, so I can go back to eat it.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go L to (4,6), but obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is free, then to (3,6) not possible, so down to (4,5) or something.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (4,6), I can go D to (4,5), then L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut need to see if possible.\n\nTurn 7: after eating F2 at (6,6), snake head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)? When I ate F3 at (6,4) on turn 5, snake [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nThen turn 6 move U to (6,5), no eat, snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 7 move U to (6,6), eat F2, so snake grows: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), and new segment, so [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nNow from (6,6), move L to (5,6), possible, head to (5,6), body follows: head to (5,6), body1 to (6,6), body2 to (6,5), body3 to (6,4), tail (5,4) moves to (6,4)? Positions: before move, head (6,6), body1 (6,5), body2 (6,4), body3 (5,4)\n\nAfter head move to (5,6), no eat, so new head (5,6), body1 moves to previous head position (6,6), body2 moves to previous body1 position (6,5), body3 moves to previous body2 position (6,4), and tail (5,4) is not there anymore, it moved off.\n\nSnake has 4 segments: head, body1, body2, body3 which was tail.\n\nAfter moving, new positions: head (5,6), body1 (6,6), body2 (6,5), body3 (6,4)\n\nSo snake [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nNow from (5,6), I can move U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, not possible. D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6) body cannot. So only D or L.\n\nL to (4,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf L to (4,6), then to (3,6) not possible, obstacle, so from (4,6) I can only go D to (4,5) or U to (4,7) wall not, or L to (3,6) not, R to (5,6) body.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I go D to (4,5), then I can go to (3,5) to eat F1.\n\nBut F1 at (3,5) is available until turn 9, and current turn is 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 7: just moved to (5,6)\n\nTurn 8: move to (4,6) or (5,5)\n\nSay turn 8 move L to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 9 move D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 10 move L to (3,5) to eat, but turn 10, F1 life span 8 from turn 2, available until turn 9? Turn 2: L=8, turn 3:7, ..., turn 9: L=1, available, turn 10: L=0 gone. So on turn 10, it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 9: L=1, so available on turn 9, but when I move on turn 10, it's after turn 9, so on turn 10 the food is gone.\n\nFood life span: at turn t, with life span L, it is available on turns t to t+L-1.\n\nTurn 2: available turns 2 to 2+8-1=9, so turn 9 is last chance to eat.\n\nOn turn 10, it's gone.\n\nIn the sequence, if on turn 9 I am at (4,5), I can move to (3,5) and eat on turn 9.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nCurrent turn 2.\n\nPlan:\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4)  // towards F3\n\nBut (3,4) not food, F3 is at (6,4)\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4) move R to (3,4), snake [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,4), snake [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,4), eat F3, snake [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]  length 3\n\nTurn 6: move U to (6,5), no eat, snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6), eat F2, snake [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]  length 4\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6), no eat, snake [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTurn 9: need to eat F1 at (3,5)\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) on turn 8, then on turn 9 move D to (4,5), but (4,5) is not (3,5), I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,6), on turn 9, I can move directly to (3,5)? From (4,6) to (3,5) is left and down, but I can only move one step, so to (3,6) not possible, or (4,5), or (5,6) body, or (4,7) wall.\n\nSo from (4,6), only possible moves: U to (4,7) wall no, D to (4,5), L to (3,6) obstacle no, R to (5,6) body no. So only D to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 9, from (4,6) move D to (4,5), then snake head at (4,5), body at (5,6)? Positions: before move, snake [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]? After turn 8 move to (5,6), snake [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTurn 9: move from (5,6) to (4,6), head to (4,6), body1 to (5,6), body2 to (6,6), body3 to (6,5), and tail (6,4) moves off? New positions: head (4,6), body1 (5,6), body2 (6,6), body3 (6,5)\n\nSnake [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\nThen move to (4,5)? From (4,6), move D to (4,5), possible.\n\nHead to (4,5), no eat, body1 to (4,6), body2 to (5,6), body3 to (6,6), and tail (6,5) moves off.\n\nSnake [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]\n\nBut now on turn 9, I am at (4,5), and F1 at (3,5) is adjacent left. I can move L to (3,5) on turn 10? But turn 10 F1 is gone, since life span 8, last on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (4,5), and to eat (3,5), I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9, but I am at (4,5) on turn 9, so I cannot eat it on turn 9; on turn 10 I move, but food gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nOn turn 9, I need to be at (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut from above, on turn 9, after moving to (4,6), I am at (4,6), not at (3,5).\n\nI could have gone directly to (3,5) earlier.\n\nAlternative: go for F1 first.\n\nFor example, on turn 2, move U to (2,5), then turn 3 move R to (3,5) and eat F1.\n\nThen at turn 3, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] as before.\n\nThen I can move R to (4,5) on turn 4, for example.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (5,5), then to (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is at y=4, so from (5,5) I can go D to (5,4), then R to (6,4) to eat F3 on turn 6 or something.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5), snake [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), eat F1, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]  length 3\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5), no eat, snake [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  // body: (3,5) and (2,5), head to (4,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body1 (3,5), body2 (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4), no eat, snake [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]  // head to (4,4), body1 to (4,5), body2 to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4), no eat, snake [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,4), eat F3, snake [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]? When eating, new head (6,4), body (5,4), and previous body, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] and the (4,5) is still there? No.\n\nBefore move: snake [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]? From turn 6: after move to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]? Let's correct.\n\nAfter turn 5: snake [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4), no eat, head to (5,4), body1 to (4,4), body2 to (4,5), so snake [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\n(4,5) is body.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,4), eat F3, so head to (6,4), body segments: (5,4) remains, (4,4) remains, and new tail growth, so snake [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] and the (4,5) is gone? No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body is all kept, new head position.\n\nPositions before move: head (5,4), body1 (4,4), body2 (4,5)\n\nMove to (6,4) and eat, so new head (6,4), body1 at (5,4), body2 at (4,4), and since eating, a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (4,5), so snake: head (6,4), body (5,4), body (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nSo [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nNow from (6,4), as before, can only move U or D.\n\nSay U to (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nThen U to (6,6) on turn 9 to eat F2.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (6,5), no eat, snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]? Positions: before move head (6,4), body1 (5,4), body2 (4,4), body3 (4,5)\n\nHead move to (6,5), no eat, so new head (6,5), body1 to (6,4), body2 to (5,4), body3 to (4,4), and tail (4,5) moves off.\n\nSnake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6), eat F2, snake [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]? Eat, so new head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and new tail at (4,4), so length 5.\n\nBut then at (6,6), only move L to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut I ate all three food by turn 9.\n\nIn this case, I ate F1 on turn 3, F3 on turn 7, F2 on turn 9.\n\nAll within life span.\n\nAnd snake length 5.\n\nIf I went for F3 first, I might miss F1.\n\nIn the first plan, when I went for F3 first, I couldn't reach F1 on time because of the path.\n\nBut in this plan, I can eat all.\n\nMoreover, after eating F1 early, I had space to move.\n\nSo this seems better.\n\nBut in this plan, on turn 2, I moved U to (2,5), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut when I ate at (3,5), I was able to move R to (4,5) without problem.\n\nFrom (3,5), after eating, I moved R to (4,5), which was fine.\n\nThen down to (4,4), etc.\n\nNo issue with the obstacle.\n\nSo this route allows me to eat all food.\n\nIf I move directly R to (3,4) on turn 2, I can still go U to eat on turn 3, same as above.\n\nBut moving U first or R first both can lead to eating (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nIn the U then R case, on turn 2 move U to (2,5), turn 3 move R to (3,5) eat.\n\nIn R then U case, on turn 2 move R to (3,4), turn 3 move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nBoth similar.\n\nBut if I move R to (3,4) and then not eat, I can go to F3.\n\nBut eating F1 first seems ok.\n\nTo maximize, since F3 has longer life span, I can eat F1 first which has shorter relative life, but all have plenty.\n\nLife span 8 and 9, from turn 2, F1 and F2 expire turn 9, F3 turn 10.\n\nBut in the plan, I can eat all.\n\nNow, about the initial move.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating all, I need to find more food, but no more food given, so perhaps that's all for now.\n\nThe state only has these three food, so after eating, I need to survive, but with no food, I can just move around without dying.\n\nBut since no more food, score doesn't increase, so the game might end or something, but not specified.\n\nI think for this, eating all is good.\n\nNow, to avoid risks, in the path I took, when I was at (6,4) with body, I could only move U or D, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly at (6,6).\n\nNo immediate deaths.\n\nAnother option: go for (6,4) directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), move R to (3,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen instead of going U, go R to (4,4) on turn 3, etc., as before.\n\nBut then I eat F3 on turn 5, but F1 might not be eaten if I don't go back.\n\nIn that case, with the snake longer, it might be harder to reach (3,5) in time.\n\nFor example, on turn 5 at (6,4), length 3, to go to (3,5), Manhattan distance |6-3| + |4-5| = 3+1=4, from turn 5 to turn 9, 4 turns, so possible if no obstacles.\n\nBut with the internal obstacle, and the body, it might be tight.\n\nFor instance, from (6,4), turn 5, go U to (6,5), then to (5,5), (4,5), then to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 5: at (6,4) after eating F3, snake [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (6,5), snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (5,5), snake [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move L to (4,5), snake [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5), but (3,5) is food, eat F1.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nAnd on turn 7, I didn't go to F2, but F2 at (6,6) is still there.\n\nOn turn 7, at (5,5), I could go U to (5,6) instead of L, but (5,6) then to (6,6) to eat F2.\n\nBut then I might not reach F1.\n\nIf on turn 7, from (5,5) I go U to (5,6), then turn 8 go R to (6,6) eat F2, then on turn 9 at (6,6), I can only go L to (5,6), but from (5,6) to (3,5) is far, |5-3| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, but turn 9 I need to be at (3,5), but at turn 9 I am at (6,6) after eating or (5,6), cannot reach (3,5) in one turn.\n\nAfter eating F2 on turn 8? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 5: at (6,4) after F3\n\nTurn 6: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7: if U to (6,6) but (6,6) has food, so if I go U to (6,6) on turn 7, eat F2, then at (6,6), snake longer.\n\nBut then from there, to reach (3,5) by turn 9.\n\nTurn 7: eat F2 at (6,6), snake say [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)] or something.\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (5,6), snake [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTurn 9: need to be at (3,5), but from (5,6) to (3,5) is not adjacent, |5-3|=2, |6-5|=1, min 3 moves, so on turn 9 I can move to (4,5) or (5,5), not (3,5), so cannot eat F1 on turn 9.\n\nThus, if I eat both F3 and F2 first, I might miss F1.\n\nWhereas if I eat F1 first, I can still eat F3 and F2 later.\n\nTherefore, better to eat F1 first since it's closer and has less remaining life relatively, but all same except F3 has one more turn.\n\nBut in terms of position, F1 is closest.\n\nSo I think moving towards F1 is better.\n\nThus, on turn 2, I should move to set up eating F1 on turn 3.\n\nSo either move U to (2,5) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), then on turn 3 move R to (3,5) eat.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4), then on turn 3 move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nBoth are similar, but moving U first might be slightly better because (2,5) is closer to the top, but with obstacle, but not immediate issue.\n\nMoving R to (3,4) first, then U to (3,5), same thing.\n\nI think both fine.\n\nBut to start, let's choose move U on turn 2.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nThe answer should include multiple turns.\n\nSince I need to output actions for several turns, I can plan the next few.\n\nBut the state may change after each move, but since no new food or changes, I can plan a sequence.\n\nAssume no changes.\n\nSo for turn 2: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) and eat F1\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,5)  // as in the plan\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,4) and eat F3\n\nTurn 8: move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) and eat F2\n\nThen after that, I need to move, say on turn 10 move L to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide actions starting from turn 2.\n\nHow many turns to output? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but no end specified. Probably for a few turns, or until decision.\n\nSince thinking ahead 5 turns, I can output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 6.\n\nBut in turn 6, I might not have eaten all.\n\nPerhaps output until I eat or something.\n\nTo be simple, I'll output for turns 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nNow, for turn 2, action U.\n\nThen turn 3, action R to eat.\n\nThen turn 4, action R to (4,5)\n\nIn the grid, from (3,5) to (4,5) is right.\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5) I can move D to (4,4), as I said.\n\nAfter turn 4, snake at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5) or something.\n\nIn turn 4: after moving to (4,5) no eat, snake [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]? Let's track positions.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5), snake [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), eat, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5), no eat (no food there), head to (4,5), body1 to (3,5), body2 to (2,5), tail (2,4) moves off? New positions: head (4,5), body1 (3,5), body2 (2,5)\n\nSnake [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4), no eat, head to (4,4), body1 to (4,5), body2 to (3,5), so snake [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4), no eat, head to (5,4), body1 to (4,4), body2 to (4,5), snake [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (6,4) eat, etc.\n\nFor output, I can do:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nThat gets to (5,4) on turn 6.\n\nThen later to eat F3 and F2.\n\nSince the food positions might be eaten or not, but in this case, all will be eaten.\n\nTo confirm, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, when I move to (4,4) on turn 5, is there danger? (4,4) is fine.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,6) is not in the way.\n\nAlso, tail reward: not applicable.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nIf I move R on turn 2 to (3,4), then U on turn 3 to (3,5) eat, same as above, then R to (4,5) on turn 4, etc.\n\nSlightly different path but similar.\n\nI think U then R is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating all available food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the food at (3,5) first, as it is the closest and has a limited lifespan (available until turn 9).\n- Then proceed to eat the food at (6,4) and (6,6), leveraging their longer lifespans.\n- Avoid the internal obstacle at (3,6) and walls.\n- Ensure the snake does not trap itself, especially after growing.\n\n**Reasoning and 5+ Turn Lookahead:**\n- **Current State (Turn 2)**: Snake head at (2,4), direction U. Possible moves: U (to (2,5)), L (to (1,4)), or R (to (3,4)). D is invalid (instant reverse).\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 2)**: Move U to (2,5). This positions the head to eat (3,5) on the next turn and avoids moving toward the less accessible food first.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 3). After eating, the snake is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]. From here, moving U is blocked by the obstacle (3,6), and moving L or D risks collision or reduces mobility. Moving R to (4,5) is safe and opens paths.\n- **Turn 4**: Move R to (4,5). No food eaten, but this moves toward the food at (6,4) and avoids the top-right area where the obstacle limits movement.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (4,4). This descends to the same row as (6,4) and positions for a direct path. The food at (6,4) has a long lifespan (until turn 10), so no rush.\n- **Turn 6**: Move R to (5,4). Continues toward (6,4) efficiently. By turn 7, the snake can eat (6,4).\n- **Beyond Turn 6**: \n  - Turn 7: Move R to (6,4) to eat food (+1 score, length 4). Then, from (6,4), move U toward (6,6).\n  - Turn 8: Move U to (6,5). \n  - Turn 9: Move U to (6,6) to eat food (+1 score, length 5). All food is eaten within lifespans.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Eating (3,5) early is safe because the tail is not adjacent to the food, avoiding tail reward danger.\n  - The path avoids walls and the obstacle. After eating (3,5), moving R then D keeps the snake centered and mobile.\n  - Long-term, after eating all food, the snake can navigate open areas (e.g., leftward from (6,6)) to survive.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 2 to 6):**\n- Turn 2: U (up) to (2,5) – Positions for imminent food capture.\n- Turn 3: R (right) to (3,5) – Eats food at (3,5), score +1.\n- Turn 4: R (right) to (4,5) – Advances toward (6,4) safely.\n- Turn 5: D (down) to (4,4) – Aligns with (6,4) row.\n- Turn 6: R (right) to (5,4) – Final step before eating (6,4) on turn 7.\n\nThis sequence eats all food by turn 9, maximizes score (+3), and maintains high survivability by avoiding enclosed spaces.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8 units wide and 8 high. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent snake positions: head at (3,5), then body at (2,5), and tail at (2,4). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is right (R), which means it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,6) with life_span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,4) with life_span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life_span 10 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life spans are decreasing each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t=4. I need to plan actions for turn 4, turn 5, turn 6, etc., at least 5 turns ahead, but probably more since the food has life spans that might require waiting.\n\nSince the head is at (3,5) and moving right, on turn 4, I can move U, D, L, or R, but I cannot instantly reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move left (L) on this turn. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So valid cells are (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n\nx from 0 to 7 inclusive, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free? No, the walls occupy the cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. So the inner grid where snake can be is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? But let's check the snake position: head at (3,5), which is within x=1-6, y=1-6? x=3, y=5, and y=5 is between 1 and 6? y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, similarly x=1 to 6 free.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are free. Similarly x=1,2,3,4,5,6 free.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6). (3,6) is on the border? y=6, but y=6 is not a wall, y=7 is wall. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 is free, but (3,6) has an obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2) all should be within bounds.\n\n(6,6): x=6, y=6, x=6 is free? x=7 is wall, so x=6 should be free, y=6 free except for obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- All (x,y) where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7: walls.\n\n- Plus internal obstacle: (3,6)\n\nSo free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake: positions at turn 4: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4). So the snake occupies (3,5), (2,5), (2,4).\n\nAfter moving, the tail will move, so if snake moves, the head goes to new position, each segment follows, tail leaves its position.\n\nFood: (6,6) life 6, (6,4) life 7, (3,2) life 10. Since current turn is 4, life span decreases each turn, including current? The state says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 4, for (6,6), life_span=6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life_span is the number of turns it will last, including current turn? Let's read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life_span N, it appears at some turn, and disappears at turn t + N, where t is when it was spawned? Not specified when spawned.\n\nIn the state, at turn 4, food has life_span given, so for (6,6) life_span=6, that means it will disappear after 6 turns from now? Or including current turn?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we have life_span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nSo for (6,6) at turn 4, life_span=6, so:\n\n- After turn 4, life_span becomes 5\n\n- After turn 5, becomes 4\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 9, becomes 0, disappears? Let's see.\n\nAt the start of turn t, food has life_span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, (6,6) has life_span 6. After turn 4 is completed, life_span becomes 5. After turn 5, 4, and so on, until after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9, and disappears after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span=7 at turn 4: after turn 4, 6; turn 5,5; ... after turn 10, 0, disappears.\n\n(3,2) life_span=10: after turn 4,9; ... after turn 13,0, disappears.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score by eating food, but prioritize long-term survival. So I should plan a path to eat food safely.\n\nCurrent head at (3,5), moving right. So from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (3,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,5)\n\nLeft (L) is not possible because it's reverse; current direction R, so cannot go left.\n\nNow, check if these cells are free:\n\n- (3,6): but there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\n- (3,4): is this free? Snake body is at (2,5) and (2,4), but (3,4) is empty? Let's see occupied cells: snake at (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So (3,4) is empty. Also, no wall or obstacle mentioned, so should be free.\n\n- (4,5): empty? x=4,y=5, not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nAlso, (3,6) is blocked by obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5) at turn 4: U is blocked, so only D or R.\n\nD: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (4,5)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food positions and their life spans.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is close, but below. (6,6) and (6,4) are to the right.\n\nSince snake is at (3,5), moving right, I might want to go towards the food on the right.\n\nBut (6,6) and (6,4) have shorter life spans; (6,6) disappears after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10, (3,2) after turn 13.\n\n(3,2) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\nBut I need to eat to grow and score.\n\nAlso, avoid risks like getting trapped.\n\nNow, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) blocked.\n\nSo rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4). So the snake is L-shaped: from (2,4) up to (2,5), then right to (3,5).\n\nAfter a move, the tail will move to (2,5) if head moves, etc.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (4,5) at turn 4, then new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5). Tail was (2,4), but since head moved, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to the previous position of the next segment, but in snake movement, when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: before move: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nAfter move right: head to (4,5), then body: the first body segment (which was at (2,5)) moves to where head was, (3,5). The tail segment (at (2,4)) moves to where the first body was, (2,5). So new positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (3,4): head to (3,4), body: (2,5) moves to (3,5)? Body segments: the segment that was at (2,5) moves to (3,5), and the tail at (2,4) moves to (2,5). So new positions: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\n(3,4) is new head, then (3,5) which was head, now body, and (2,5) which was body, now tail? Before: head (3,5), body1 (2,5), body2/tail (2,4)\n\nAfter moving head down to (3,4):\n\n- Head moves to (3,4)\n\n- Body1 moves to previous head position (3,5)\n\n- Body2/tail moves to previous body1 position (2,5)\n\nSo new snake: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, back to turn 4 choices: move D to (3,4) or R to (4,5).\n\nI need to think which is better for long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2), which is below, at (3,2).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), I'm closer to (3,2), but (3,2) has long life, so not urgent.\n\n(6,6) and (6,4) have shorter life, so I might need to go there soon.\n\nDistance to (6,6) from (3,5): |dx| + |dy| = |3| + |1| = 4, since x from 3 to 6, diff 3, y from 5 to 6, diff 1, so Manhattan distance 4.\n\nSimilarly to (6,4): |3| + |1| = 4? x from 3 to 6 diff 3, y from 5 to 4 diff 1, so dist 4.\n\nTo (3,2): |0| + |3| = 3.\n\nBut with obstacles and snake body, it might be different.\n\n(3,6) is blocked, so I cannot go directly up.\n\nNow, let's consider moving right to (4,5) first.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nNew positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction was R, so now head direction R? After moving, the new head direction is the move direction, I assume.\n\nFor the next turn, I can move U, D, R, but not L (since current direction R, cannot reverse to L).\n\nNow, from (4,5), possible moves:\n\nU: to (4,6)\n\nD: to (4,4)\n\nR: to (5,5)\n\nL: to (3,5), but (3,5) is now occupied by body? In the positions, (3,5) is body, so moving to (3,5) would collide with body, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): is it free? Not occupied, not wall. y=6, but (4,6) is not obstacle, obstacle is only (3,6).\n\n(4,4): free.\n\n(5,5): free.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is y=6, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5): U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5). L to (3,5) is occupied, so invalid.\n\nNow, food at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I'm closer to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is corner, might be risky.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is also near border.\n\nBut let's think about eating (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (4,5), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) to (5,5) then (6,5) or to (5,6) etc.\n\nBut (6,6) requires moving to (6,5) or (5,6) first, then to (6,6).\n\nNow, life_span: (6,6) has life 6 at turn 4, so after turn 4, life 5; it can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life 7 at turn 4, after turn 4, life 6, etc.\n\nTurn 4: current turn.\n\nAfter turn 4, for (6,6), life_span becomes 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including turn 5? Let's clarify the countdown.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L.\n\nDuring turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten.\n\nAfter turn t, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life_span was 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (6,6) at turn 4 start, life_span=6.\n\nDuring turn 4, if head moves to (6,6), it can be eaten, but it's not possible since head is at (3,5).\n\nAfter turn 4, life_span becomes 5.\n\nAt turn 5 start, life_span=5 for (6,6), so it can be eaten during turns 5 to 9, and after turn 9, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nSuppose at turn 4, I move R to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,5), I could move R to (5,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,5), body to (4,5), tail to (3,5), so snake [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied, so invalid.\n\n(5,6): free? Yes.\n\n(5,4): free.\n\n(6,5): free, x=6,y=5.\n\nThen to reach (6,6), from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5) first.\n\nIf go to (5,6) at turn 6, then positions [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,6), I can go to (6,6) by moving R to (6,6), since (6,6) is adjacent.\n\nMove R to (6,6), eat food if it's there.\n\nAt turn 7, (6,6) life_span: start turn 4:6, after turn4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2? Let's track:\n\nTurn 4 start: life=6\n\nAfter turn 4: life=5\n\nTurn 5 start: life=5\n\nAfter turn 5: life=4\n\nTurn 6 start: life=4\n\nAfter turn 6: life=3\n\nTurn 7 start: life=3\n\nDuring turn 7, if head moves to (6,6), it can be eaten since life>0.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nWhen you eat food, if positive, length increases by one, so after eating, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, if at turn 7, head moves to (6,6) and eats, then positions: head at (6,6), and the body segments: since tail doesn't move, the new position is [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]? Before move: positions [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nHead moves to (6,6), so new head (6,6)\n\nBody segments move to previous positions: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,6)\n\nBut since we eat, we add a new segment where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: before move: [A, B, C] where A head, B body, C tail.\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new, B to A, C to B, so [new, A, B]\n\nAfter move with eating: head to new, B to A, C stays, and new segment at C, so [new, A, B, C]\n\nIn terms of list: before: [A, B, C]\n\nAfter move and eat: [new_head, A, B, C]  so length +1.\n\nC is still there.\n\nIn this case, at turn 7, before move, positions [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nMove R to (6,6), eat food (6,6), so new positions: head (6,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, previous body (5,5) becomes next body, tail (4,5) stays, and since eaten, new segment added at tail position, so snake is [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nLength 4 now.\n\nBut (6,6) is at the corner, and after eating, I need to move away.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,5): is (6,5) free? Currently, before move, (4,5) is tail, but after move, positions are (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) is empty? (6,5) is not occupied.\n\nBut (6,5) is within bounds, x=6,y=5, not wall.\n\nL to (5,6), but (5,6) is now occupied by body.\n\nR to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves: only D to (6,5), since U and R are walls, L is body.\n\nMove D to (6,5).\n\nThen new positions: head to (6,5), body: (5,6) moves to (6,6)? Positions before move: [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nHead moves to (6,5), so new head (6,5)\n\nThen body segments: first body (5,6) moves to previous head position (6,6)\n\nSecond body (5,5) moves to previous position of first body, which was (5,6)\n\nTail (4,5) moves to previous position of second body, which was (5,5)\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nNo eating, so length same.\n\nNow head at (6,5), which is near (6,4) food.\n\n(6,4) is below, at (6,4).\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut (6,4) has life_span, at turn 7.\n\nFirst, let's see if (6,4) is still there.\n\nTurn 4 start: (6,4) life=7\n\nAfter turn 4: life=6\n\nTurn 5: start life=6, after:5\n\nTurn 6: start 5, after:4\n\nTurn 7: start 4, after:3\n\nSo at turn 8, I can move to (6,4).\n\nFrom (6,5) at turn 8? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) eat, grow to length 4\n\nTurn 8: from (6,6) move D to (6,5)\n\nNow at turn 8, positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow possible moves: U to (6,6), but (6,6) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nD to (6,4), which should be free.\n\nL to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (7,5), wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,4).\n\nMove to (6,4), and if food is there, eat it.\n\n(6,4) at turn 8 start: life_span? Turn 4 start:7, after turn4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, turn8 start:3, so yes, can eat.\n\nEat (6,4), positive food, so grow to length 5.\n\nNew positions: head to (6,4), body: (6,6) moves to (6,5)? Before move: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nHead moves to (6,4), so new head (6,4)\n\nFirst body (6,6) moves to previous head (6,5)\n\nSecond body (5,6) moves to previous first body (6,6)\n\nThird body (5,5) moves to previous second body (5,6)\n\nAnd since eaten, tail stays, so new segment at (5,5), so positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nNow snake is at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nThis is a bit messy, and (6,4) is corner, only move possible from here? From (6,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,5), but occupied by body.\n\nD to (6,3), but y=3, and y=0 wall, but y=3 is within 1-6, so (6,3) should be free, but is it?\n\nCurrently occupied: snake at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), so (6,3) is empty.\n\nL to (5,4), empty? x=5,y=4, not occupied.\n\nR to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U, but (6,5) occupied, so invalid; D to (6,3); L to (5,4); R invalid.\n\nU is invalid because (6,5) is body.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf move D to (6,3), then positions: head to (6,3), body (6,5) to (6,4), (6,6) to (6,5), (5,6) to (6,6), (5,5) to (5,6), so [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] and tail (5,5) moves to (5,6)? Positions: before [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nHead move to (6,3), no eat, so:\n\nNew head (6,3)\n\nFirst body (6,5) moves to (6,4)\n\nSecond body (6,6) moves to (6,5)\n\nThird body (5,6) moves to (6,6)\n\nTail (5,5) moves to (5,6)\n\nSo [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nNow head at (6,3), which is near bottom.\n\nBut y=1 to 6, so (6,3) is ok.\n\nThen I can move left or down, etc.\n\nBut this seems risky because I'm stuck in the corner with a long snake.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (3,2) which I haven't eaten, and it has long life.\n\nBut in this path, I ate two foods, score +2, snake length 5.\n\nBut now I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), I can move L to (5,3) or D to (6,2) or U to (6,4) but (6,4) is body.\n\n(6,4) is now body, so U invalid.\n\nD to (6,2), L to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) should be free.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with snake body around, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps this is not optimal for long-term.\n\nAnother option: at turn 4, instead of moving right, move down to (3,4).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4)\n\nThen positions: head to (3,4), body (2,5) moves to (3,5)? Before: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nMove D to (3,4), so new head (3,4)\n\nFirst body (2,5) moves to previous head (3,5)\n\nTail (2,4) moves to previous first body (2,5)\n\nSo [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nNow head at (3,4), direction down (D).\n\nFood at (3,2) is below, at (3,2), so I can go down to eat it.\n\n(3,2) has life_span 10 at turn 4, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I also have (6,6) and (6,4) with shorter life, so I should prioritize them if possible.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go right or down.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body, occupied, invalid.\n\nD to (3,3), free? y=3, not occupied.\n\nL to (2,4), but (2,4) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), so (2,4) is empty? Before tail was at (2,4), but after move, tail moved to (2,5), so (2,4) is free now.\n\nR to (4,4), free.\n\nAnd cannot go up because (3,5) occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nNow, to go to (6,6) or (6,4), I need to go right.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,4) at turn 4? Turn 4 is done, we moved D to (3,4), so now turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4).\n\nThen positions: head to (4,4), body (3,5) moves to (3,4)? Before: [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nHead move R to (4,4), so new head (4,4)\n\nFirst body (3,5) moves to previous head (3,4)\n\nTail (2,5) moves to previous first body (3,5)? Previous first body was at (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied? When moving, the body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nBefore move: segments: head A=(3,4), body B=(3,5), tail C=(2,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4), new head.\n\nThen B moves to where A was, (3,4)\n\nC moves to where B was, (3,5)\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nC was at (2,5), moves to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is now occupied by body.\n\nBut (2,5) is free now.\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 6, from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), free? (4,5) not occupied.\n\nD to (4,3), free.\n\nR to (5,4), free.\n\nL to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nNow, to reach (6,6), I can go up and right.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,5) at turn 6.\n\nThen positions: [ (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] head (4,5), body (4,4), tail (3,4)? Before: [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) ] after head to (4,5): new head (4,5), B moves to (4,4), C moves to (3,4)? C was at (3,5), moves to where B was, (4,4)? Positions: before head A=(4,4), B=(3,4), C=(3,5)\n\nAfter head to (4,5): new head (4,5)\n\nB moves to A's old position (4,4)\n\nC moves to B's old position (3,4)\n\nSo [ (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ]\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,5), move R to (5,5), for example.\n\n[ (5,5), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), move R to (6,5) or U to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, since obstacle only at (3,6).\n\nMove U to (5,6) at turn 8.\n\nPositions: [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,6), move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\n(6,6) at turn 9 start: life_span? Turn 4:6, after t4:5, t5:4, t6:3, t7:2, t8:1, turn9 start:1, so can eat during turn 9.\n\nAfter turn 9, life=0, disappears.\n\nSo eat at turn 9.\n\nThen grow to length 4.\n\nBut (6,4) is still there, life_span 7 at turn 4, after t4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, turn10 start:1, can eat turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,6) after eating, positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ] similar to before.\n\nThen only move D to (6,5), then to (6,4) to eat, but at (6,5) on turn 10, then to (6,4) turn 11.\n\nTurn 10: from (6,6) move D to (6,5), positions [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] no eat.\n\nTurn 11: from (6,5) move D to (6,4) eat, grow to length 5.\n\nThen same corner issue.\n\nBut I have (3,2) food at (3,2), which is far and has long life, but if I go to eat (6,6) and (6,4), I might not have time to go back to (3,2), or it might be risky.\n\n(3,2) life_span 10 at turn 4, after t4:9, t5:8, ..., up to after turn 13:0, so can be eaten until turn 13.\n\nAfter eating at (6,4) at turn 11, I can try to go to (3,2), but from (6,4) to (3,2) is distance |3| + |2| =5, and I have turns 12 and 13 to reach, but with a long snake, it might be difficult.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) after eating, positions [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] or something.\n\nThen I need to move left, but the body is blocking.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3), but to go left, L to (5,4).\n\nThen to (4,4), etc., but the snake is long, and the grid has limited space.\n\nMoreover, there is an obstacle at (3,6), which might not affect directly.\n\nBut let's think about the first choice at turn 4.\n\nAnother idea: go for (3,2) first, since it's closer and has longer life, but the other food might disappear.\n\n(6,6) and (6,4) have short life, so if I don't eat them, I miss out.\n\nBut (3,2) is safe to eat.\n\nLet's consider moving down at turn 4 to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then to (3,2).\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4), positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4), move D to (3,3), for example.\n\nPossible moves at turn 5: U invalid, D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nMove D to (3,3).\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), body (3,5) moves to (3,4), tail (2,5) moves to (3,5)? Before: A=(3,4), B=(3,5), C=(2,5)\n\nHead to (3,3), new head (3,3)\n\nB moves to A's old (3,4)\n\nC moves to B's old (3,5)\n\nSo [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nNow snake is vertical at x=3, y=3,4,5.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 6, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nD to (3,2), free? (3,2) is food, and not occupied.\n\nL to (2,3), free.\n\nR to (4,3), free.\n\nSo D, L, R possible.\n\nMove D to (3,2) to eat food at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) life_span 10 at turn 4, after t4:9, t5:8, turn6 start:8, so can eat.\n\nEat at turn 6, grow to length 4.\n\nPositions before move: [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nHead move to (3,2), eat, so new head (3,2)\n\nB moves to (3,3)\n\nC moves to (3,4)\n\nAnd new segment at C's old position (3,5), so [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nSnake now at (3,2) to (3,5), all x=3.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 7, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), but occupied by body.\n\nD to (3,1), but y=1, and y=0 wall, but y=1 is free? y=0 wall, y=1 to 6 free, so (3,1) free.\n\nL to (2,2), free.\n\nR to (4,2), free.\n\nU invalid, so D, L, R.\n\nNow, I can move R to (4,2) to go towards the right side.\n\nBut (6,6) and (6,4) have limited life.\n\n(6,6) can be eaten until turn 9, so at turn 7, I have turns 7,8,9 to reach it.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (6,6) distance |3| + |4| =7, so need at least 7 moves, but I have only 3 turns to move, turn 7,8,9 to be at (6,6) on turn 9.\n\nBut with snake length 4, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, turn 7: move R to (4,2)\n\nPositions: before [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nHead to (4,2), no eat, so new head (4,2)\n\nB moves to (3,2)\n\nC moves to (3,3)\n\nD moves to (3,4)  (since length 4, segments: head A, body B, C, tail D)\n\nBefore: A=(3,2), B=(3,3), C=(3,4), D=(3,5)\n\nHead to (4,2), new head (4,2)\n\nB moves to A's old (3,2)\n\nC moves to B's old (3,3)\n\nD moves to C's old (3,4)\n\nSo [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]\n\nD was at (3,5), moves to (3,4), so (3,5) free.\n\nTurn 8, from (4,2), move R to (5,2) or U to (4,3) etc.\n\nTo go to (6,6), I need to go up and right.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,3)\n\nPositions: head to (4,3), B to (4,2), C to (3,2), D to (3,3)  [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 9, from (4,3), move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3), but (6,6) is at (6,6), so from (4,3) to (6,6) in one move impossible, need at least two moves, but at turn 9, if I move to (4,4), still not close.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (6,6), I need to go to (5,3) or (4,4), then to (5,4) or (5,5), then to (6,5) or (5,6), then to (6,6), at least 3 moves, but turn 9 is the last chance for (6,6), so I can't reach it by turn 9 from here.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2) at turn 8, if I move directly right, to (5,2), then turn 9 to (6,2), still not close to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at y=6, I'm at y=2 or 3, so I need to go up, but not enough time.\n\nSo if I go for (3,2) first, I miss (6,6) and possibly (6,4).\n\n(6,4) can be eaten until turn 10, so from turn 7, I have turns 7,8,9,10 to reach (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 7, to (6,4) distance |3| + |2| =5, so possible in 5 moves, but with snake, it might be ok.\n\nTurn 7: at (3,2), move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,2), move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,2), move U to (5,3) or R to (6,2), but to go to (6,4), I need to go up.\n\nMove U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), move U to (5,4)\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) at turn 11, but turn 11 is too late for (6,4).\n\n(6,4) at turn 10 start: life_span? Turn 4:7, after t4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, turn10 start:1, can eat during turn 10.\n\nAfter turn 10, life=0, disappears.\n\nSo to eat at turn 10, I need to be at (6,4) on turn 10.\n\nFrom (5,3) at turn 10, I can move to (6,3) or (5,4), not directly to (6,4).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (6,4) is not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, but not horizontal/vertical, so I need two moves, like to (6,3) then (6,4), but (6,4) at turn 10.\n\nIf at turn 10, I am at (5,3), I can move to (6,3) or (5,4), not to (6,4) directly.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,4) on turn 10 from (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 9 I am at (5,2), I can move to (5,3) or (6,2), then turn 10 to (5,4) or (6,3), not (6,4).\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,4) if I go for (3,2) first.\n\nTherefore, to eat both (6,6) and (6,4), I need to go right first.\n\nBut earlier, when I go right, I get stuck in the corner.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,4) before (6,6) or something.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 4, move down to (3,4), then turn 5 move right to (4,4), then turn 6 move down to (4,3) or something to go towards (6,4) directly.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (3,4), positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4), positions [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nMove D to (4,3), positions: head to (4,3), B to (4,4), C to (3,4), so [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]\n\nC was at (3,5), moves to (3,4).\n\nTurn 7, from (4,3), move R to (5,3) or D to (4,2) etc.\n\nTo reach (6,4), which is at (6,4), from (4,3), distance |2| + |1| =3.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3)\n\nPositions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3), move U to (5,4)  (since (6,4) is at y=4)\n\nMove U to (5,4), positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\n(6,4) at turn 9 start: life_span? Turn 4:7, after t4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, turn9 start:2, so can eat at turn 9.\n\nEat at turn 9, grow to length 4.\n\nPositions: before [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nHead to (6,4), eat, so new head (6,4), B moves to (5,4), C moves to (5,3), new segment at C's old (4,3), so [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nNow head at (6,4), similar to before, only can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so only D to (6,3).\n\nThen move to (6,3), and so on.\n\nBut (6,6) is still there, can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (5,4) before moving to (6,4), but (6,6) is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to (5,4), so I can't eat it on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 9, I could move U to (5,5) instead of R to (6,4), but (5,5) may not have food, and I need to eat (6,4) which has life until turn 10.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) at turn 9, then from (5,5) I can move U to (5,6) turn 10, then to (6,6) turn 11, but (6,6) disappears after turn 9, so at turn 10, it's gone.\n\n(6,6) after turn 9 life=0, gone.\n\nSo I can only eat (6,4) but not (6,6) in this path.\n\nSo to eat both, I need to go for (6,6) first as in the initial plan.\n\nBut the corner is risky.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,6) and then not eat (6,4) to avoid the corner, and go for (3,2) instead.\n\nBut (3,2) has long life.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this case, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nAt turn 4, the snake positions are (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), so no food there.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2), all free.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, it's better to eat (3,2) first and then see, but I miss the other food.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating any is good, but to maximize, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nBut with the grid and snake, it might be hard to eat all three.\n\nGrid size 6x6 minus one obstacle, so 35 cells, but snake starts at 3, so can grow.\n\nBut with borders, corners are dangerous.\n\nTo avoid the corner, when I eat (6,6), instead of going down to (6,5), I can only go down, but in the first plan, after eating (6,6), I had to go down to (6,5), then to (6,4) if I want to eat it.\n\nBut if I don't eat (6,4), I can go left from (6,5).\n\nFor example, in the first plan, after eating (6,6) at turn 7, positions [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5), positions [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nThen turn 9, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (6,4), if I eat it.\n\nOr L to (5,5) invalid, so only D to (6,4) or if I move to (6,4) and eat or not.\n\nBut (6,4) is food, so if I move to it, I eat it.\n\nBut to avoid growing in corner, I can choose not to eat it by not moving there, but the AI should maximize score, so I should eat if possible.\n\nBut for survival, it might be better to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, after eating (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), then from (6,5), I have to move D to (6,4) because no other choice, then eat (6,4), then from (6,4), I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), then I can escape the column.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4) at turn 8 or whenever, positions [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] as before.\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,4), move L to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head to (5,4), B moves to (6,4), C moves to (6,5), D moves to (6,6), E moves to (5,6) or something.\n\nBefore: let's say segments A=(6,4), B=(6,5), C=(6,6), D=(5,6), E=(5,5) for length 5.\n\nHead move L to (5,4), no eat, so new head (5,4)\n\nB moves to A's old (6,4)\n\nC moves to B's old (6,5)\n\nD moves to C's old (6,6)\n\nE moves to D's old (5,6)\n\nSo positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nNow head at (5,4), which is more central.\n\nThen I can move to other places, like towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) can be eaten until turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 9, to (3,2) distance |2| + |2| =4, so possible.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nThen I can eat (3,2) later.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,2) is still available.\n\nSo in this case, by eating both (6,6) and (6,4), I get +2, then go for (3,2) for +3 total.\n\nIf I go for (3,2) first, I get +1 but miss the other two.\n\nSo better to go for the right food first.\n\nNow, back to turn 4, I need to choose move.\n\nAt turn 4, move R to (4,5) to start going right.\n\nThen as in first plan.\n\nBut in the first plan, I had to go up to (5,6) etc., but at turn 4, from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4) then right, but that might be slower for reaching (6,6).\n\nLet's calculate the turns for the first plan.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nPositions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nPositions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)  (since (3,6) blocked, but (5,6) is free)\n\nPositions: [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) eat\n\nPositions after eat: [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5)  (only choice)\n\nPositions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,4) eat, if (6,4) is there\n\n(6,4) at turn 9 start: life_span 2, so can eat.\n\nEat, positions after: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 10: from (6,4), move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3)\n\nTo avoid corner, move L to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head to (5,4), B to (6,4), C to (6,5), D to (6,6), E to (5,6) so [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nNow head at (5,4), I can go to (3,2).\n\nFor example, move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) can be eaten until turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 10, to (3,2) distance 4, so turn 11 to (4,4) or (5,3), turn 12 to (3,4) or (4,3), turn 13 to (3,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut to eat at (3,2), I need to be there on turn 13 or before.\n\nFor example, turn 10: at (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nPositions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ]? After move: new head (4,4), B to (5,4), C to (6,4), D to (6,5), E to (6,6), so [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n\nTurn 11: from (4,4), move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so move D to (4,3) for example.\n\nMove to (4,3), positions: head to (4,3), B to (4,4), C to (5,4), D to (6,4), E to (6,5), so [ (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nTurn 12: from (4,3), move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2), etc.\n\nMove L to (3,3), positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nTurn 13: from (3,3), move D to (3,2) to eat.\n\n(3,2) at turn 13 start: life_span? Turn 4:10, after t4:9, t5:8, ..., t12:2, turn13 start:2, so can eat at turn 13.\n\nEat, grow to length 6.\n\nSo I can eat all three foods.\n\nIn this case, moving right at turn 4 is good.\n\nIf I move down at turn 4, I might not reach (6,6) in time.\n\nSo for turn 4, I should move right.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=4, so I need actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8,... but at least 5 turns, so up to turn 9 or so.\n\nBut I can output the sequence as planned.\n\nIn the plan, at turn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: R (to eat (6,6))\n\nThen turn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D (to eat (6,4))\n\nBut in turn 9 move D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6, I moved U to (5,6), but from (5,5), I could move R to (6,5) first.\n\nIn my initial, I moved U to (5,6) to approach (6,6).\n\nBut from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5) move R to (6,5)\n\nThen positions: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSame as before, just different path.\n\n(6,5) to (6,6) is up.\n\nIn terms of turns, same.\n\nNow, to be precise, I should output the actions.\n\nBut in the state, head direction is given, and I need to consider no instant reverse.\n\nAt turn 4, head direction R, I move R, so new direction R.\n\nTurn 5, head direction R, I move R to (5,5), new direction R.\n\nTurn 6, head direction R, I can move U, D, R.\n\nI move U to (5,6), new direction U.\n\nTurn 7, head direction U, I move R to (6,6), which is not reverse (reverse would be D, but I move R), so ok.\n\nThen turn 8, head direction R (since moved R), I move D, not reverse of R? Reverse of R is L, but I move D, so ok.\n\nThen turn 9, head direction D, I move D to (6,4), same direction.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to box the actions.\n\nBut I should confirm if at turn 4, moving down is better, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is not eaten yet in the sequence, but I can plan to eat it later, as I did.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, I can output the first few moves.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list multiple turns.\n\nProbably at least 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) and eat\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5)\n\nThat's 5 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nI can add turn 9: move D to (6,4) and eat.\n\nBut turn 9 is t1+5=9.\n\nt1=4, t1+1=5, ..., up to t1+5=9.\n\nBut I can do more if needed.\n\nIn the core rules, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, I need to provide actions for a sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows multiple turns.\n\nI think for now, I'll output turns 4 to 9.\n\nBut turn 9 is eating (6,4), which might be risky, but in the plan, it works.\n\nTo avoid risk, I could not eat (6,4), but I should to maximize score.\n\nIn the path, after eating (6,6), I have to move down to (6,5), then to (6,4) is the only way, so I eat it.\n\nThen move left to escape.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nFor turn 7, moving R to (6,6) is valid only if (6,6) is free, which it is, and I eat it.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9.\n\nNow, in the state, there is food at (3,2), but I don't go there yet, but that's fine for the sequence.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan a sequence of moves that efficiently targets high-value food with limited life spans while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The current state (turn 4) has the snake at positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] with head direction \"R\" (right). The food items are all positive (+1 score, +1 length) but have decreasing life spans: (6,6) disappears after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10, and (3,2) after turn 13. The internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks upward movement from (3,5).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 4)**: From (3,5), moving up (U) to (3,6) is blocked by the obstacle. Moving left (L) is impossible due to the no-instant-reverse rule (current direction is right). Valid moves are down (D) to (3,4) or right (R) to (4,5).\n- **Prioritizing Short-Life Food**: (6,6) and (6,4) have shorter life spans (must be eaten by turns 9 and 10, respectively) compared to (3,2) (eaten by turn 13). Moving right immediately targets (6,6) and (6,4) efficiently.\n- **Path to (6,6)**: From (3,5), moving right to (4,5) on turn 4, then to (5,5) on turn 5, and up to (5,6) on turn 6 positions the snake to eat (6,6) on turn 7. This requires 4 moves and is achievable within the life span.\n- **Path to (6,4)**: After eating (6,6), the only safe move from (6,6) is down to (6,5) on turn 8 (due to wall and body constraints), then down to (6,4) on turn 9 to eat it before it disappears.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both right-side foods, moving left from (6,4) on subsequent turns avoids the risky corner and allows targeting (3,2) later. The snake grows to length 5 after eating two foods, but the grid has space to maneuver away from the corner.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: Moving right initially avoids delays that could miss (6,6) and (6,4). Moving down on turn 4 would make reaching (6,6) by turn 9 impossible due to distance and turns required. No tail reward danger exists, as no food is under the snake.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 4-9):\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (4,5). This starts the path toward (6,6) and avoids the obstacle. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (5,5). Continues toward (6,6). New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move up (U) to (5,6). Positions the snake to access (6,6) next turn. New head direction: U.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (6,6) and eat the food. Snake grows to length 4. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move down (D) to (6,5). Only safe move (up and left are blocked by body/walls, right is wall). New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (6,4) and eat the food. Snake grows to length 5. After this, move left on turn 10 to (5,4) to escape the corner and target (3,2).\n\nThis sequence eats two high-value foods by turn 9, maximizing early score. (3,2) can be targeted from turn 10 onward with turns 10-13 available, ensuring all food is eaten if possible. The plan avoids collisions and dead ends by not lingering in corners.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R (right)\nTurn 5: R (right)\nTurn 6: U (up)\nTurn 7: R (right)\nTurn 8: D (down)\nTurn 9: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So moving to any cell where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision. The playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable. Similarly for y: y=1 to y=6. But let's list the coordinates:\n\n- x=0: all y, wall\n\n- x=7: all y, wall\n\n- y=0: all x, wall\n\n- y=7: all x, wall\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6) is a wall cell, so we can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5). So the snake is horizontal, head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). Direction is right, so it's moving right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1 each. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (6,6), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 6, life span 4, it will disappear after turn 6+4-1=9? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 on turn t+1, and disappears when it would be decreased to 0 or after N turns.\n\nThe text says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if a food has life span L, it will be present during turn t, and after L-1 more turns, it disappears before turn t+L.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it will be gone.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t with life span L, after this turn (turn t), the life span becomes L-1. So it will be present for L more turns? No.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, during turn t, when we make a move, the food is there with life span L. After the move, at the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears before turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, for the next turn.\n\nSo for food at (6,6) with life span 4 at turn 6:\n\n- After turn 6, life span becomes 3\n\n- After turn 7, becomes 2\n\n- After turn 8, becomes 1\n\n- After turn 9, becomes 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 10.\n\nThus, it is available from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive? At turn 6, life span 4, present. After turn 6, span 3, present on turn 7. After turn 7, span 2, present turn 8. After turn 8, span 1, present turn 9. After turn 9, span 0, gone before turn 10. So available on turns 6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4): life span 5 at turn 6, so available turns 6 to 10? After turn 6: span 4, present turn 7; ... after turn 9: span 1, present turn 10; after turn 10: span 0, gone. So turns 6 to 10.\n\nLife span N at turn t means it will be present for N turns starting from t, including t.\n\nAt turn t, with life span L, it is present and can be eaten on turn t. Then after turn t, span decreases to L-1, and so on, until span=1 after some turn, present one more turn, then gone.\n\nSo for (6,6): L=4 at t=6, present on t=6,7,8,9.\n\n(6,4): L=5 at t=6, present on t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\n(3,2): L=8 at t=6, present on t=6 to 13.\n\nNow, snake is at [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], head at (5,5), direction right. So from (4,5) to (5,5) is moving right, so current direction is R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So cannot move left on next turn. Can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is wall.\n\nSo cells: (1,1) to (6,6), but (3,6) invalid.\n\nSnake occupies (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (3,5) is the tail.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2).\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see possible actions for turn 6.\n\nHead at (5,5), moving R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R: to (6,5)\n\n- U: to (5,6)\n\n- D: to (5,4)\n\nCannot L, because opposite direction.\n\nNow, check each:\n\nFirst, R to (6,5): what is there? (6,5) is not a food position, and not wall (x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x=6 is playable, y=6 is playable, but (6,6) is food, not wall. (6,5) should be empty, I think. Snake is at (5,5),(4,5),(3,5), so (6,5) is free. Also, not wall. So moving to (6,5) is safe? But let's see collision.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will have head at (6,5), then body at (5,5), (4,5), tail at (3,5). But when we move, the tail moves only if no food eaten. Since no food at (6,5), tail moves, so new positions: head to (6,5), body: (5,5) and (4,5), tail (3,5) is removed? Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nSnake positions: after move without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail segment removed.\n\nSo from [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], move R to (6,5), no food, so new positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), then (4,5). Tail (3,5) is gone.\n\nBody: (4,5) becomes the new tail.\n\nNow, is (6,5) safe? Not wall, not body, since body was at (5,5) and (4,5), new positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So head at (6,5), body at (5,5) and (4,5), no collision.\n\n(6,5) is within bounds, x=6, y=5, x=6 is between 1 and 6? x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are playable. y=1 to 6. So (6,5) is fine.\n\nNow, U to (5,6): (5,6) is not food, not wall? (5,6) should be empty. But is it under snake? Snake is at (5,5), etc., so (5,6) is free. But (3,6) is wall, but (5,6) is not (3,6). (5,6) is different cell. So moving to (5,6) should be safe. After move, head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5) removed? New positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), then (4,5).\n\nIs (5,6) wall? No, walls are borders and (3,6), so (5,6) is free.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) is not food, not wall, so safe. Head to (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n\nNow, but there is food at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I'm at (6,5), which is adjacent to (6,6) food, but not eating it yet.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (5,6), adjacent to (6,6).\n\nMoving D to (5,4), adjacent to (6,4)? (6,4) is food, but (5,4) is not adjacent directly? Adjacent means one cell away, so from (5,5), U to (5,6) is adjacent to (6,6) since (5,6) and (6,6) share edge.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,4) is adjacent to (6,4) and also to (5,3) etc.\n\nBut I need to think about eating.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,5), which has no food, so no issue now.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here food are at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2), none of which are under snake body. Snake is at (5,5),(4,5),(3,5), so (3,5) is tail, but food at (3,2), different.\n\n(3,2) is food, but snake is at (3,5), not the same cell.\n\nSo all food are accessible if we move to them.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but safely.\n\nPlan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, possible actions for turn 6:\n\n- R: to (6,5)\n\n- U: to (5,6)\n\n- D: to (5,4)\n\nNow, from each, I need to see future moves.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (6,6) disappears after turn 9, so available turns 6-9.\n\n(6,4) available turns 6-10.\n\n(3,2) available turns 6-13.\n\nSince (6,6) has shorter life, I might prioritize it if possible.\n\nBut need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, let's consider moving towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), head at (5,5).\n\nTo eat (6,6), I need to move to (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or R to (6,5), then from there to (6,6).\n\nIf I go directly? But from (5,5), moving R to (6,5) or U to (5,6), not directly to (6,6) since not adjacent diagonally, only orthogonal.\n\nSo to reach (6,6), I need two moves: e.g., R then U, or U then R.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), from (5,5), D to (5,4) then R to (6,4), or R to (6,5) then D to (6,4).\n\nFor (3,2), it's far, at (3,2), snake at (5,5), so need to go left and down.\n\nBut (3,2) has long life, so less urgent.\n\nNow, let's simulate each option for turn 6.\n\nFirst, option 1: Move R to (6,5) on turn 6.\n\nAfter turn 6: head at (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5). Tail was (3,5), removed. So positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection: since moved R, new direction R.\n\nFood: (6,6) life span was 4, after turn 6, decreases to 3, so still present for turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow turn 7: from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) but cannot because opposite direction? Current direction is R, opposite is L, so cannot move left to (5,5). Can move U, D, or R.\n\nR to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nSo possible: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,6) has food, (6,4) has food.\n\nIf U to (6,6): eat the food, since (6,6) is food. Reward +1, length increases.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (6,6), body: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, then (5,5), then (4,5). So snake becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], length 4.\n\nDirection now U, since moved up.\n\nFood (6,6) eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (6,4) life span was 5, after turn 6 decreases to 4, after turn 7 decreases to 3, still present.\n\n(3,2) similarly.\n\nNow, if on turn 7 I move D to (6,4) instead: eat (6,4), head to (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], direction D.\n\nBut back to turn 7 choices from (6,5).\n\nI can also not eat immediately, but since both adjacent cells have food, I might as well eat one.\n\nBut let's see which one to eat.\n\nIf I eat (6,6) on turn 7, I'm at (6,6), which is corner, might be risky.\n\n(6,6) is at top-right? y=6 is the top, since y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable, but adjacent to wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=6.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow direction U.\n\nPossible moves on turn 8: from (6,6), direction U.\n\nCannot move D (down, y-1), opposite to U? Current direction U, opposite is D, so cannot move down.\n\nCan move U, but y=6, U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, collision.\n\nCan move L to (5,6), or R to (7,6), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is empty? Currently, no food there, and not occupied.\n\nSo move L to (5,6), no food, so tail moves: head to (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). Tail (4,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]? Order: head was (6,6), moves to (5,6), so new head (5,6), then previous head (6,6) becomes body, then (6,5), then (5,5). (4,5) is gone.\n\nSo positions: head (5,6), body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, food: (6,4) is at (6,4), life span decreasing, but not eaten yet.\n\n(3,2) still.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (4,6), R to (6,6) but cannot, opposite direction? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R to (6,6). Can move U, D, or L.\n\nU to (5,7), y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) is now a body segment! Positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). So (5,5) is the last body segment.\n\nMoving D to (5,5) would be head colliding with body, death.\n\nL to (4,6): (4,6) is what? (4,6) might be free or not.\n\nIs (4,6) occupied? Snake at (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). (4,6) not listed, so should be free. But is it wall? Walls: border and (3,6). (4,6) is not border, x=4 between 1-6, y=6, not (3,6), so free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,6).\n\nMove to (4,6), no food, so tail moves: head to (4,6), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). Tail (5,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, turn 10: from (4,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,6), but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall! Cannot move there.\n\nR to (5,6) cannot, opposite direction.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5): (4,5) is not occupied now? Positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). (4,5) is free? But is it food? Food at (6,4) and (3,2), not (4,5).\n\nBut moving D to (4,5): is it possible? Current direction L, moving D down, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\n(4,5) should be free.\n\nMove to (4,5), no food, tail moves: head to (4,5), body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Tail (6,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nAnd so on. But I ate one food, and now snake is at (4,5), etc.\n\nBut in this path, on turn 7 I ate (6,6), and survived so far.\n\nBut on turn 8 I had only one choice, L to (5,6), then turn 9 L to (4,6), turn 10 D to (4,5).\n\nNow, food (6,4) is at (6,4), which I didn't eat, and it might disappear or something.\n\nLife span of (6,4): at turn 6, life span 5, so after turn 6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0, gone before turn 11? After turn 10, life span decreases to 0, so on turn 10 it might still be present? Let's see.\n\nAt start of turn 10, life span of (6,4): at turn 6, span 5; after turn 6:4; turn7:3; turn8:2; turn9:1; at turn 9, span 1, present; after turn 9, decreases to 0, gone before turn 10. So on turn 10, (6,4) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 10, (6,4) not available.\n\n(3,2) still available.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate only one food.\n\nBut on turn 7 from (6,5), I could have chosen to eat (6,4) instead.\n\nLet's see that.\n\nBack to after turn 6 move R to (6,5).\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nHead at (6,5), move D to (6,4), eat food, so head to (6,4), tail doesn't move, body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). New positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], direction D.\n\nFood (6,4) eaten, removed.\n\nNow turn 8: from (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall, U to (6,5) cannot, opposite direction.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\n(6,3) is empty, (5,4) empty.\n\nSay move D to (6,3), no food, tail moves: head to (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). Tail (4,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,3), direction D, can move D, L, R, but D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\nEtc. But I ate (6,4), and snake is longer.\n\nBut again, only one food eaten.\n\nNow, on turn 6, instead of R, I could move U to (5,6).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,6).\n\nNo food at (5,6), so tail moves: head to (5,6), body: (5,5), (4,5). Tail (3,5) removed. Positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nFood: (6,6) life span decreases to 3 after turn 6, still present.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) wall, invalid; D to (5,5) cannot, opposite; L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nR to (6,6) has food.\n\nL to (4,6) no food.\n\nSo can move R to (6,6) or L to (4,6).\n\nIf move R to (6,6): eat food, head to (6,6), body: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). New positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)], direction R.\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), direction R.\n\nCannot move L to (5,6), opposite; cannot U to (6,7) wall; cannot R to (7,6) wall; only D to (6,5)? D to (6,5) is down.\n\n(6,5) is not occupied? Positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). (6,5) free.\n\nMove D to (6,5), no food, tail moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5). Tail (4,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can go down or left, etc.\n\nAte one food.\n\nIf on turn 7 from (5,6) I move L to (4,6) instead.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,6), no food, tail moves: head to (4,6), body: (5,6), (5,5). Tail (4,5) removed? Positions: from [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)], move to (4,6), no eat, so head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5). (4,5) gone.\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can move to other places, but (6,6) food is still there, I can go back, but from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision; or U to (4,7) wall; D to (4,5); L to (3,6) wall.\n\nSo only D to (4,5).\n\nMove to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6). (5,5) removed? New positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (4,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) is not body, body is (4,6) and (5,6), so (5,5) free.\n\nBut (6,6) food might expire soon.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo far, moving towards the food gives one food, but I need to plan to eat more.\n\nAnother option on turn 6: move D to (5,4).\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has no food? Food is at (6,4), not (5,4).\n\nSo no eat, tail moves: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5). Tail (3,5) removed. Positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nFood (6,4) at (6,4), life span after turn 6: 4 (since was 5, decrease after turn).\n\nAt turn 6, (6,4) span 5, after turn decreases to 4.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,3), U to (5,5) cannot opposite, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nR to (6,4) has food.\n\nSo can move R to (6,4) or D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf move R to (6,4): eat food, head to (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). New positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], direction R.\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,4), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4) cannot opposite, R invalid.\n\n Etc.\n\nAte one food.\n\nBut I have three foods, and I need to eat more than one.\n\nPerhaps I can eat both (6,6) and (6,4) if I sequence properly.\n\nOr go for (3,2) later.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), which is bottom-left, snake at (5,5), so I need to move left and down.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 6, move R to (6,5), then on turn 7, move to (6,6) or (6,4), but I can only eat one at a time.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can eat (6,6) on turn 7, then from (6,6), I have to move L to (5,6) on turn 8, then from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) but (5,5) might be body or not.\n\nIn the first sequence, when I ate (6,6) on turn 7, then moved to (5,6) on turn 8, then to (4,6) on turn 9, then to (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (4,4) or (5,5).\n\n(3,2) food is at (3,2), so I can move down and left.\n\nBut life span long, so possible.\n\nBut I only ate one food so far.\n\nIf on turn 6 I move U to (5,6), then on turn 7 move R to (6,6) to eat, same as before.\n\nOr, on turn 6 move D to (5,4), then on turn 7 move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nStill one food.\n\nTo eat both, I need to be at a position to reach both.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can eat either on turn 7.\n\nBut after eating one, I might not be able to eat the other easily.\n\nFor instance, after eating (6,6) at (6,6), I can only move L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body if I came from there, but in the sequence, after eating (6,6), positions are (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,5) is body, so moving to (5,5) from (5,6) would be collision.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can only move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5) but collision, so only L to (4,6), then I'm moving away from (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is below, but I'm at (4,6), far away, and (6,4) might expire soon.\n\nLife span: (6,4) available until turn 10, so on turn 8,9,10 I can eat it, but from (4,6) to (6,4) is several moves, and I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 8, after moving from (5,6) to (4,6), positions (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), then I can move D to (4,5), then to (4,4), then to (5,4), then to (6,4), but on turn 8 to 11, and (6,4) gone after turn 10, so on turn 11 not available, but turn 10 is last chance.\n\nTurn 8: at (4,6), move D to (4,5), no food, positions head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)? Let's track.\n\nAfter eating (6,6) on turn 7, positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] turn 7.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6)? From (6,6) to (5,6), head to (5,6), no eat, tail moves, so positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). (4,5) removed.\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,6), head to (4,6), no eat, tail moves, positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). (5,5) removed.\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,5), head to (4,5), no eat, tail moves, positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). (6,5) removed.\n\nNow on turn 10, I am at (4,5), and (6,4) is still available? On turn 10, (6,4) life span: after turn 6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, after turn9 decreases to 0, gone before turn 10, so on turn 10, (6,4) is gone. Missed it.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,4), from (4,5) on turn 10, I can move R to (5,5), then to (6,5), then to (6,4), but (6,4) gone.\n\nSo cannot eat (6,4) if I ate (6,6) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I ate (6,4) first, I might not eat (6,6).\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4) on turn 7 from (6,5), positions at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (6,3), no food, positions head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). (4,5) removed.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (5,3) or D to (6,2), etc., away from (6,6).\n\n(6,6) available until turn 9, so on turn 9 I can be at (6,5) and move U to (6,6), but on turn 9, I am at (6,3), not at (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), to reach (6,6), I need to go up, but body might be in the way.\n\nFor example, on turn 9 at (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), but (6,4) is body position? Positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So (6,4) is body, cannot move there.\n\nMove L to (5,3), then from there, I can go to (5,4), (5,5) but (5,5) body, etc., not easy to reach (6,6) by turn 9.\n\nSo likely can only eat one of the two foods at (6,6) and (6,4).\n\nTherefore, I should choose which one to eat based on position or other factors.\n\nBut there is also (3,2) food with long life.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (3,2) directly, but it's farther, and I might miss the others if I don't eat them soon.\n\n(6,6) disappears after turn 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) until turn 10.\n\n(3,2) until turn 13.\n\nOn turn 6, head at (5,5), (6,6) is at (6,6), which is one step right and one up, so I can reach it in two moves, but not in one.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4).\n\nFor (3,2), it's three steps left and three down, so farther.\n\nSo to eat (6,6), I need to be at (6,5) or (5,6) on turn 7 to eat on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4), need to be at (6,5) or (5,4) on turn 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move R to (6,5) on turn 6, I can eat either on turn 7.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6) on turn 6, I can eat (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4) on turn 6, I can eat (6,4) on turn 7.\n\nBut I can't eat both with the same head position.\n\nSo I have to choose one.\n\nNow, which one is better?\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is a corner, so after eating, I might be trapped, as in the earlier sequence, I had to move left immediately.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is less cornered, since I can move down or left.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4), at (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4), so more options.\n\nWhereas (6,6) forces me to move left only.\n\nAlso, (6,4) has longer life, but since I can eat it soon, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut for long-term, eating (6,4) might allow me to then go for (3,2) or other.\n\nThere is also the internal wall at (3,6), which might affect movement.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating immediately and position to eat multiple.\n\nBut the foods are at different locations.\n\nLet's list all cells.\n\nGrid: 6x6 playable, x1-6, y1-6, except (3,6) wall.\n\nSo free cells: all except walls and snake.\n\nSnake: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) on turn 6.\n\nAfter move, depending.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at bottom-left.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nBut with the snake short, I can maneuver.\n\nPerhaps on turn 6, I move D to (5,4), then on turn 7 I eat (6,4) by moving R, then from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4), but (5,4) might be body.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), positions (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,4) is body, so from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) if possible, but direction might restrict.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) at (6,4), direction R, so on turn 8, from (6,4), can move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4) cannot opposite, R invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf move U to (6,5), no food, positions head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). (4,5) removed.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) to eat the other food, if still there.\n\nOn turn 8, (6,6) life span: after turn 6:3, turn7:2, so on turn 8, span 2, present.\n\nMove U to (6,6) on turn 8 from (6,5), eat (6,6), so head to (6,6), tail not move, body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). New positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,6), only move L to (5,6), as before.\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo I ate both (6,4) and (6,6) in this case.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,4) from (5,5). No eat, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,4) to eat (6,4). Head to (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). New positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], direction R.\n\nTurn 8: from (6,4), direction R, move U to (6,5). No food, tail moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). (4,5) removed. Positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), direction U, move U to (6,6) to eat (6,6). Head to (6,6), body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). New positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)], direction U.\n\nNow, on turn 10: from (6,6), direction U, only possible move L to (5,6), as before.\n\nMove to (5,6), no food, tail moves: head to (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). Tail (5,5) removed. Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from here, I can go down or left, towards (3,2).\n\nAnd I have eaten two foods.\n\nIf on turn 6 I had moved R to (6,5), I could do similar: turn 6 R to (6,5), turn 7 D to (6,4) eat, turn 8 U to (6,5)? From (6,4) move U to (6,5), but (6,5) is where I was, but after eating (6,4), positions (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) is body, so moving U to (6,5) from (6,4) is collision, since (6,5) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 7: head at (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nMoving U to (6,5) would be to body segment, death.\n\nSo cannot move back to (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,4), after eating, I can only move D to (6,3), not up.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,6) from there easily.\n\nTherefore, to eat both, the better sequence is to first go to (5,4) or (5,6), then to the side, then up or down.\n\nSpecifically, from (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 6, then R to (6,4) on turn 7 to eat, then U to (6,5) on turn 8, then U to (6,6) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nAs above.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6) on turn 6, then R to (6,6) on turn 7 to eat, then I can move D to (6,5) on turn 8, but from (6,6) move D to (6,5), which is down, and (6,5) may be free.\n\nAfter eating (6,6) on turn 7: positions (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (6,5), no food, tail moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5). (4,5) removed. Positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat on turn 9, since (6,4) still available? On turn 9, (6,4) life span after turn 6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, present.\n\nSo move D to (6,4) on turn 9, eat, head to (6,4), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5). New positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nAlso ate both.\n\nIn this case, with move U first.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat both (6,6) and (6,4) by going to the row first or column.\n\nBut with move D first, I eat (6,4) first, then (6,6); with move U first, I eat (6,6) first, then (6,4).\n\nNow, which is better? In terms of position after eating.\n\nAfter eating both, in first sequence (D then R then U U), I end up at (6,6) on turn 9, then move to (5,6) on turn 10.\n\nIn second sequence (U then R then D D), I end up at (6,4) on turn 9.\n\n(6,4) is less cornered than (6,6), so from (6,4) I can move down to (6,3) or left to (5,4), etc., more options.\n\nFrom (6,6), I have to move left first.\n\nBut since I need to go to (3,2) eventually, from (6,4) might be better to go down and left.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (3,6), which might block paths.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so y=6, x=3 blocked.\n\nIn the positions, when I move to (5,6) or (4,6), I need to avoid (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, so I can't move there anyway.\n\nNow, for the (3,2) food, I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for several turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 6 to turn 10 or so.\n\nFirst, let's choose a path.\n\nOption: move D on turn 6 to (5,4), then R on turn 7 to (6,4) eat, then U on turn 8 to (6,5), then U on turn 9 to (6,6) eat.\n\nThen on turn 10, from (6,6), move L to (5,6).\n\nNow, after that, I can go towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (5,6) on turn 10, I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 10: positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 9: after eating (6,6), positions [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]? In the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 9: head at (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,6), no food, tail moves: head to (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). Tail (5,5) removed. Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5) or U invalid.\n\n(5,5) is not occupied, positions are (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), so (5,5) is free.\n\nI can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\nTo go to (3,2), I need to go left and down.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so I can move to (4,6) then down, or to (5,5) then left.\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, so when going down on left side, need to avoid x=3 y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is row 6, (3,2) is y=2.\n\nSo I can go to x=4 or x=2, etc.\n\nSince I have time, I can plan to eat (3,2).\n\nBut for now, in the short term, by moving D on turn 6, I can eat both foods.\n\nIf I move R on turn 6, I can only eat one immediately, but with the U first sequence, I can also eat both.\n\nBut in U first: turn 6 U to (5,6), turn 7 R to (6,6) eat, turn 8 D to (6,5), turn 9 D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen on turn 9, at (6,4), I can move to other places.\n\nIn this case, after turn 9, positions: after eating (6,4), head at (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nThen I can move L or D.\n\nNow, (3,2) is available until turn 13, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the grid constraints.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect if I go to left top, but since I'm going to (3,2), which is bottom, and (3,6) is top, it might not block directly.\n\ny=6 is top, y=1 bottom? y=0 wall, y=1 to 6 playable, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\n(3,2) is x=3,y=2, bottom left area.\n\n(3,6) is wall at top left.\n\nTo go from (6,4) to (3,2), I can move left and down, e.g., to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly from other positions.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 choice.\n\nI think moving D or U both allow eating both foods, but moving D might be slightly better because after eating both, I end at (6,4) or (6,6), and (6,4) has more escape routes.\n\nIn U first sequence, I end at (6,4) on turn 9.\n\nIn D first sequence, I end at (6,6) on turn 9.\n\n(6,6) is corner, so (6,4) is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 6, I should move D to (5,4).\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 6: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: R to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 8: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: U to (6,6) eat\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,6), move L to (5,6)\n\nNow, for turn 10 and beyond, I need to go towards (3,2).\n\nBut since the food has long life, I can move safely.\n\nTo output 5+ turns, I can list up to turn 10 or so.\n\nThe current turn is t1=6, so actions for turn 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAnd I need to specify the action.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have turn 6: D, turn 7: R, turn 8: U, turn 9: U.\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,6) after eating, move L to (5,6)\n\nBut after turn 9 move U to (6,6), positions as above.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,6)\n\nNow, is that safe? Yes.\n\nThen I can continue, but for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nPerhaps list for 5 turns: turn 6 to 10.\n\nBut turn 10 action is included.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable here.\n\nAlso, in turn 8, I move U to (6,5), which is empty, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,5) on turn 8, is there any risk? No.\n\nNow, but in the state, all food are positive, no negative.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nIf I want to include going to (3,2), but not necessary for now.\n\nPerhaps after turn 10, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), then D to (4,5), etc., towards (3,2).\n\nBut for the answer, list the actions.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and I have a plan for 5 turns: turn 6 to 10, eating two foods.\n\nTurn 6: move D\n\nTurn 7: move R to eat\n\nTurn 8: move U\n\nTurn 9: move U to eat\n\nTurn 10: move L\n\nIn terms of the grid, all safe.\n\nNow, confirm the life spans.\n\nOn turn 9, eating (6,6): at turn 9, (6,6) life span should be: at turn 6 span 4, after turn 6:3, turn7:2, turn8:1, turn9:0? But at turn 9, if span decreases after the turn, but when we eat during the turn, it should be fine.\n\nAt start of turn 9, life span of (6,6) is 1, so it is present and can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in turn 7, (6,4) span 3, eaten.\n\nNo issue.\n\nFor (3,2), I can eat later, but not in this 5-turn window.\n\nSo for the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 8, I move to (6,5), which is not eating, but setting up for turn 9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save a turn, but I think it's necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: from (5,4) after turn 6, on turn 7 I could move directly to eat, but only (6,4) is adjacent, not (6,6).\n\nSo I have to go through (6,5).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nBut turn 10 L is from (6,6) to (5,6).\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nThe format is to list each turn action.\n\nSince t1=6, start from turn 6.\n\nAlso, in the direction, after each move, direction changes.\n\nBut in the plan, it's consistent.\n\nI think this works.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating both the (6,4) and (6,6) food items, which have shorter life spans, before they disappear. The (3,2) food has a longer life span (available until turn 13) and can be targeted later. \n\nThe chosen sequence:\n- **Turn 6 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (5,4). This positions the snake to eat (6,4) on the next turn and avoids the corner risk of (6,6) initially.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (6,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases). This also allows access to (6,6) later.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to (6,5). This sets up the snake to eat (6,6) on the next turn.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to (6,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases). Both short-life foods are now eaten.\n- **Turn 10**: Move left (L) to (5,6) to avoid the corner and start moving toward the (3,2) food.\n\nThis sequence eats two foods in 5 turns, increasing the snake length by 2. After turn 10, the snake can continue toward (3,2) (e.g., via (4,6), (4,5), etc.), leveraging the remaining life span (available until turn 13). Risks are minimized:\n- No wall or body collisions occur.\n- The internal obstacle at (3,6) is avoided during turns 6-10.\n- Tail reward danger is not applicable as the tail has no food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 7: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 8: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 9: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 10: L (left)\n}",
