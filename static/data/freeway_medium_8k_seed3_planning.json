        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=0 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with their own lanes. Cars move left or right on their freeway, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, x=0 is within the car's span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide an action that changes y to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t). At turn T, y_T is the current row. When I take action a_T, it determines y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I check if any car on freeway y_T has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't check cars on y_{T+1} for collision at T.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t1=0. I need to find their positions at future turns.\n\nThe car update is given for T > t1. Since t1=0, at turn T, the span is based on initial span at T=0.\n\nFor a car, initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nIn the rule, it says for T > t1, span(T) = [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)] for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nSince t1=0, it simplifies to:\n\nLeft-moving: span(T) = [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nRight-moving: span(T) = [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in span(T) for a car on the same freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at T=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 37, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is 48, tail 37? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be larger than tail? Let me see the notation.\n\nIn the car update rule, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] implying that τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, head > tail, so the car is moving right, head at higher x.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and h < τ? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's left-moving, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ, and it moves left, so decreasing x. But in the span, if h and τ, for left-moving, typically head is at the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should have smaller x than tail? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it should be moving right. Head at 48, tail at 37? But 48 > 37, so if head is at higher x, and moving right, that makes sense, tail at lower x.\n\nIn the span definition for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and it says [τ, h], so τ is smaller, h is larger, so for right-moving, tail at τ, head at h with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h and τ with h > τ? No.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and span [h, τ], after moving left, both decrease, so if h and τ, and it moves left, the head should be at the left end, so for left-moving, head should have smaller x than tail.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and h and τ, but which is head?\n\nIn the text: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" for car k.\n\nThen for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], but if head is at h, tail at τ, and moving left, head should be left, so h < τ.\n\nThen span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nThen at T, [h - sT, τ - sT], since moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head at h, tail at τ, moving right, head right, so h > τ, span [τ, h] since τ < h.\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: (48, 37, right, 3), so head=48, tail=37, direction=right, so since right, head=48 > tail=37, so span at t1 is [37,48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, head=-48, tail=-59? -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, so span [ -59, -48 ] because for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [tail, head].\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nSo for freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-48, -59, right, 6) same.\n\nNow freeway 5: (48,37,right,12), and (0,-11,right,12) two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, span [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, span [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same as 5, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: first car (-48,-59,right,12), head=-48, tail=-59, right, span [-59,-48]\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, right, span [-11,0]\n\nNow, I need to get from y=0 at T=0 to y=9, moving only vertically, avoiding being on a freeway y when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, collision when 0 in car span at same y and same T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 at some turn, and stay or something? No, reach position (0,9), so y=9 at that turn.\n\nBut when I reach y=9, I need to be on freeway 9? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, y=9 is the target, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and collision occurs only if on that freeway and 0 in span.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no freeway, so no cars, so no collision possible. So we can be at y=0 or y=9 safely.\n\nNow, I need to go from (0,0) to (0,9) in min turns.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, so to go from 0 to 9, min H if I go up every turn is 9 turns: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut I need to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8 during the path.\n\nAt each turn T, when I am on y_T, I must not have collision on that y_T.\n\nSo I need to ensure that for each turn T when I am on y between 1 and 8, no car on that y has 0 in span at T.\n\nSince I start at y=0, T=0, and end at y=9, some T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and each time T, check if 0 is in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nThen for a given path, when I am on y_t at turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, then it must not be occupied at t.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously, I need to compute for each k and T, the occupancy at (k,T).\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their span over time.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, (48,37,right,3)\n\nSpan at T: since right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s*T, h + s*T] = [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nBecause for right-moving, [τ + sT, h + sT]\n\nτ=37, h=48, s=3.\n\nSo span(T) = [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nNow, 0 in span if 37+3T <= 0 <= 48+3T\n\nSince 37+3T to 48+3T, this interval moves right over time.\n\nAt T=0: [37,48], 0 not in, since 37>0? 37>0, so [37,48] all positive, 0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, the left end 37+3T increases, so always positive, so 0 never in span for freeway 1. Because min x is 37 at T=0, increasing, so always x>=37>0, so 0 never occupied on freeway 1.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nspan(T) = [37+3T, 48+3T], since 37+3T >=37 >0 for T>=0, so yes, min x is 37, so 0 not in span ever. So freeway 1 has no car at x=0 at any time. So it's always safe to be on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nDirection right, head=-48, tail=-59, so span(T) = [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6T <= 0 <= -48 + 6T\n\nWhich is -59 +6T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +6T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +6T <=0 => 6T <=59 => T <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so T<=9\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +6T => 6T >=48 => T>=8\n\nSo for T from 8 to 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n\n-59 +6T <=0 when T <= floor(59/6)=9 since 6*9=54, -59+54=-5<0, 6*10=60,-59+60=1>0? -59+6T <=0 for T<=9 because T=9: -59+54=-5<=0, T=10: -59+60=1>0 not <=0.\n\n0 <= -48 +6T when -48 +6T >=0 => 6T>=48 => T>=8.\n\nT=8: -48+48=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nT=9: -48+54=6>0, so 0<=6 true.\n\nT=10: -48+60=12>0, but first inequality not hold.\n\nSo 0 in span when T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8: span=[-59+48, -48+48]= [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=9: span=[-59+54, -48+54]= [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=7: span=[-59+42, -48+42]= [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nT=10: [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car, so occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span(T)= [37 +12T, 48+12T]\n\nSince min 37>0, always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, right, span(T)= [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-11 +12T, 0 +12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span if -11+12T <=0 <=12T\n\nFirst: -11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T<=11/12 <1, so T=0? T=0: -11+0=-11<=0, 0<=0 true? 0 in span at T=0?\n\nAt T=0: span=[-11,0], so 0 is included, since it's a closed interval I assume.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 12T always for T>=0.\n\nBut -11+12T <=0 when 12T <=11, T<=11/12≈0.916, so for T=0, it holds: -11<=0 and 0<=0.\n\nT=1: -11+12=1>0, so -11+12T=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <=12T is true, but -11+12T <=0 false at T=1.\n\nAt T=0: -11+0 <=0 true, 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=1: span=[-11+12, 0+12]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for T>0, min x increasing, so only at T=0, 0 is occupied by second car on freeway 5.\n\nNow, freeway 5 has two cars, but first car never at 0, second at 0 only at T=0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied at T=0 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, so occupied at T=0 only.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at T=0 only.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span(T)= [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 +12T, -48 +12T]\n\n0 in span if -59+12T <=0 <= -48+12T\n\nFirst: -59+12T <=0 => 12T <=59 => T <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so T<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12T => 12T >=48 => T>=4\n\nT=4: -59+48= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+48=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nT=5: -59+60=1 >0 not <=0, so false; or 0 <= -48+60=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo only at T=4.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, span(T)= [-11+12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span only at T=0, as above.\n\nAt T=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt T=4: [-11+48, 48]= [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, occupied at T=0 (by second car) and T=4 (by first car).\n\nSummarize for each freeway, times when occupied (0 in span):\n\n- Freeway 1: never occupied\n\n- Freeway 2: occupied at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: occupied at T=8,9 (same as 2)\n\n- Freeway 4: occupied at T=8,9 (same)\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at T=0\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at T=0\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at T=0\n\n- Freeway 8: occupied at T=0 and T=4\n\nNow, for freeway 5,6,7, occupied only at T=0, so for T>0, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=0 and T=4, so unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 1 always safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at T=0, y=0.\n\nAt T=0, if I am on a freeway, it might be occupied, but at T=0, I am at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision. I start at (0,0), which is safe.\n\nThen I take actions to move up.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no issue.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times per freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=0, so for T>=1, safe\n\n- y=6: same, unsafe only at T=0, safe T>=1\n\n- y=7: same, unsafe T=0, safe T>=1\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=0 and T=4\n\nNow, since I start at T=0, y=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI can take action at T=0 to go to y=1 at T=1, or stay, or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so I can only S or U at T=0.\n\nIf I S, stay at y=0 for T=1, but at T=1, if I am at y=0, it's safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nSince y=0 safe, I can stay, but that increases H, so not optimal; I should move up.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn H.\n\nThe minimal H is 9 if I go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if that path is possible without collision.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction at T=0: U, so y_{1} =1\n\nAt T=1, I am on y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, so no problem.\n\nAction at T=1: U, y2=2\n\nAt T=2, on y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe at T=8,9, but T=2 is early, so safe? At T=2, is y=2 occupied?\n\nFor freeway 2, occupied only at T=8,9, so at T=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, action U at T=2, y3=3 at T=3.\n\ny=3 freeway 3, unsafe only at T=8,9, T=3<8, safe.\n\nU at T=3, y4=4 at T=4.\n\ny=4 freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, T=4<8, safe.\n\nU at T=4, y5=5 at T=5.\n\ny=5 freeway 5, unsafe only at T=0, T=5>0, so safe.\n\nU at T=5, y6=6 at T=6.\n\ny=6 freeway 6, unsafe only at T=0, T=6>0, safe.\n\nU at T=6, y7=7 at T=7.\n\ny=7 freeway 7, unsafe only at T=0, T=7>0, safe.\n\nU at T=7, y8=8 at T=8.\n\nNow at T=8, on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 is unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nAt T=8, not T=0 or T=4, so should be safe? T=8 ≠4, so safe?\n\nBut earlier we have freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9, but y=8 is different.\n\ny=8 freeway 8, occupied at T=0 and T=4 only, so at T=8, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen action U at T=8, y9=9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, on y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut at T=9, I reach y=9, so done.\n\nNow, what about during the path? At T=8, I was on y=8, which is safe at T=8.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 are unsafe at T=8, but I was not on them at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, I was on y=8, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, all positions are safe.\n\nT=0: y=0, safe (start)\n\nAction U\n\nT=1: y=1, safe (freeway 1 always safe)\n\nAction U\n\nT=2: y=2, freeway 2, at T=2, not occupied (only at T=8,9), safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3, T=3<8, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4, T=4<8, safe? T=4, freeway 4 occupied at T=8,9, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nAction U\n\nT=5: y=5, freeway 5, occupied only at T=0, T=5>0, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=6: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only at T=0, T=6>0, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=7: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at T=0, T=7>0, safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=8: y=8, freeway 8, occupied at T=0 and T=4, not at T=8, so safe\n\nAction U\n\nT=9: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nSo in 9 turns, I reached with all U actions.\n\nBut is that minimal? From 0 to 9, 9 steps up, so H=9 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at T=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at T=0.\n\nAfter first action at T=0, at T=1, y=1 if U.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, but t1=0, so at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe start at turn t1=0, y_0=0.\n\nWe apply actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, then at turn H, we have y_H.\n\nAnd we want y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn H.\n\nFor example, with H=9 actions: a0 to a8, all U, then at turn 9, y=9.\n\nT=0 to T=8: actions, T=9 position.\n\nNow, at each turn T from 0 to 8, we are at y_T, and we need to check collision at that T.\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\nT=1: y=1, safe\n\n...\n\nUp to T=8: y=8, safe as above.\n\nT=9: y=9, not checked for collision since we reached, but it's safe anyway.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nAt T=9, y=9, not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nSo with H=9, all U, it works.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about freeway 8 at T=4? But at T=4, in this path, I was on y=4, not y=8.\n\ny=4 at T=4 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=4, but if I am not on y=8 at T=4, no problem.\n\nIn the path above, at T=4, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 is occupied only at T=8 and T=9, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but from 0 to 9, min 9 moves up, so H=9 is minimum possible.\n\nCan I reach in less than 9 turns? Only if I start higher, but I start at 0, so no. Min y change per turn is 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 turns.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but actions only U,D,S, so delta y max +1, so yes, min H=9.\n\nAnd with all U, it seems possible.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5,6,7 at T=0, they are occupied, but at T=0, I am at y=0, not on them, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 8 occupied, but in the path, at T=4, I am at y=4.\n\nIs there any turn where I might be forced to be on unsafe?\n\nFor example, if I were on y=8 at T=4, it would be unsafe, but in this path, I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if I were on y=2,3,4, it would be unsafe, but in this path at T=8, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\ny=8 at T=8 is safe, as freeway 8 unsafe only at T=0,4.\n\nT=8 not 0 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, so 9 is min.\n\nBut let me see if H=9 is achievable, which it seems.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nt1=0, so actions from a_0 to a_8.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=9, so t from 0 to 8.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 8: U\n\nThen at turn 9, position y=9.\n\nBut the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so at turn t1+H-1, after action, we have the position.\n\nIn this case, after a8 at turn 8, we go to y9 at turn 9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car list, freeway 2,3,4 are identical, and 5,6,7 identical, but in the path, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point it might be unsafe.\n\nSuppose at T=4, if I were on y=8, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=8 at T=8, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, but then H larger, worse.\n\nOr go down, but y=0 min, so no.\n\nSo all U should work.\n\nBut let me check the second car on freeway 5,6,7 at T=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: at T=0, car at (0,-11,right,12), span [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 occupied.\n\nBut at T=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and at y=0, no freeway, so ok.\n\nNow, but for freeway 8, at T=0, occupied, but again, not on it.\n\nSo the path with all U actions seems collision-free.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason to do otherwise.\n\nPerhaps at some point I need to wait.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=4 quickly.\n\nAt T=4, y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe at T=4, as above.\n\nIf I were to be on y=8 at T=4, it would be bad, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, if I were on y=2, bad, but I am on y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=8 is safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 has cars, but at T=8, for freeway 8, span of first car: (-48,-59,right,12), at T=8, span=[-59+96, -48+96]= [37,48], not at 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), at T=8, span=[-11+96, 96]= [85,96], not at 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if on y=8, span first car: at T=4, [-59+48, -48+48]= [-11,0], so 0 occupied.\n\nBut not on it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nNow, in the output, for turn t1=0.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut let me write in the boxed format.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to t=8.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=9, turns from 0 to 8, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=8.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 8, after U, to y=9.\n\nBut in the action, at turn 8, I do U, to go to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 2. I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves each turn by choosing an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). y must stay within [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new freeway, at turn T, you are only on y_T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are on y, and at turn T+1 you are on y+1. So you only check collision for your current y at each turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible from y=2.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 2, player at (0,2).\n\nNow, car states:\n\nFor each freeway, k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed.\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=54, tail=43, direction=right, speed=3. Since direction is right, and head=54, tail=43? That seems odd because if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me read the car update.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (54, 43, right, 3)\n\nBut if direction is right, and head=54, tail=43, since 54 > 43, that means the car is from left to right, so tail at 43, head at 54? But in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] with h > τ? It says for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn freeway 1: (54, 43, right, 3). Since direction is right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [43, 54], I think. But 43 to 54, and direction right, so moving right.\n\nBut head is given as 54, tail as 43, so if right, head is the front, so position higher, tail lower.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left end, tail right end or something? I need to clarify the notation.\n\nLook: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, head h is the left end (smaller x), tail τ is the right end (larger x), so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, tail τ is the left end (smaller x), head h is the right end (larger x), so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn freeway 1: (h=54, τ=43, right, s=3). Since right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [43,54] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in the span at that turn, meaning min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars on some freeways, I need to check all cars on the current freeway.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince I need to go from 2 to 9, I need at least 7 up moves, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I should minimize H, so I want to go up as much as possible without colliding.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway y=1 to y=8, and player is on one of them when y between 1 and 8.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe, but I start at y=2, which is freeway? y=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for k=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), with y=0 to 9.\n\nWhen player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, since no cars.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at time t_1=2.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, when a car would be at x=0, because collision when 0 in span.\n\nFor a given freeway, at turn T, the span for each car, and see if 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find for each car, the time when it covers x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars, so I need the intervals when x=0 is occupied on that freeway.\n\nThen, for each freeway, I can find the times when it is unsafe to be on that freeway because a car is at x=0.\n\nThen, the player needs to be on a freeway only when it is safe, or not on it when unsafe.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, I need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway, the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 2.\n\nFor each car, find when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the span moves, I can solve for when 0 is between the min and max.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [43 + 3ΔT, 54 + 3ΔT]\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max: 43 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= 54 + 3ΔT\n\nBut 43 + 3ΔT <=0 and 0 <=54 +3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 43 + 3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <= -43 => ΔT <= -43/3 ≈ -14.333, but ΔT = T-2, and T is turn number, probably T>=2 or later, so ΔT >=0, so 43 +3ΔT >=43>0, so min =43+3ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, so 0 < min <= max, so 0 is never <= min, thus 0 not in span for any T>=2. Similarly, since min>0, and increasing, always positive, so on freeway 1, no car at x=0 ever for T>=2. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? min_span =43 +3ΔT, at ΔT=0, min=43>0, and increases, so yes, x=0 is never covered. So freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 6ΔT, -36 + 6ΔT]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -47 +6ΔT <=0 <= -36 +6ΔT\n\nFirst, -47 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nSecond, 0 <= -36 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo both: ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7.833\n\nSince ΔT integer (turns), ΔT from 0 to, say, 20 or so.\n\nΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7.833, so for ΔT=6,7\n\nAt ΔT=6: min = -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11, max= -36+36=0\n\nSo min=-11, max=0, so 0 <= max=0, so 0 in span? min<=0<=max, -11<=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=7: min= -47+42= -5, max= -36+42=6, so -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nΔT=8: min= -47+48=1, max= -36+48=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=5: min= -47+30= -17, max= -36+30= -6, both negative, 0 not >= max? min=-17, max=-6, so 0 > max, not <= max, so not in span.\n\nSo on freeway 2, unsafe when ΔT=6 or 7, i.e., T=2+6=8 or T=2+7=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-36, -47, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same thing, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-36, -47, right, 6), same, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12) — this is (h,tau, dir, speed), so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t_1.\n\nDirection right, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -59 +12ΔT <=0 <= -48 +12ΔT\n\nFirst, -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4.916, so ΔT=4 or 5? ΔT=4.916, so for integer ΔT, ΔT=4 and ΔT=5? Let's see.\n\nΔT=4: min= -59 +48= -11, max= -48+48=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔT=5: min= -59+60=1, max= -48+60=12, min=1>0, 0 not <= min, so not in span.\n\nΔT=4: min=-11, max=0, 0<=max, so included.\n\nΔT=3: min= -59+36= -23, max= -48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in span.\n\nSo first car unsafe at ΔT=4, T=2+4=6.\n\nNow second car on freeway 5: (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, span [τ, h] = [13, 24] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [13 + 12ΔT, 24 + 12ΔT]\n\nmin=13+12ΔT >=13>0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 not in span for any ΔT.\n\nSo only first car affects, unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=6 only? T=6.\n\nΔT=4, T=2+4=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nIdentical, so same, unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12), unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12) — direction right, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -35 +12ΔT <=0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst, -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2.916, so ΔT=2 or 3? ΔT=2.916, integer ΔT=2 and ΔT=3?\n\nΔT=2: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nΔT=3: min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, min=1>0, 0 not <= min, not in span.\n\nΔT=1: min= -35+12= -23, max= -24+12= -12, both negative, not.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=2, T=4.\n\nNow second car on freeway 8: (24, 13, right, 12), same as before, span [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT] always min>13>0, so never unsafe.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe at T=4 only.\n\nT=2+2=4.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: always safe\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at T=6\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at T=6\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at T=6\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at T=4\n\nFreeway 1 is always safe, so y=1 can be occupied anytime.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=2 is freeway 2. Is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at T=8,9, but at T=2, is it safe?\n\nFor freeway 2, at T=2, ΔT=0, min= -47 +0 = -47, max= -36 +0 = -36? Earlier: for freeway 2, span at T: [ -47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT]\n\nAt ΔT=0, min=-47, max=-36, both negative, so 0 not in span, so safe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, for other times except T=8,9.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI need to reach y=9, and minimize turns.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe unsafe freeways at certain times:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=8,9 (freeway 3 same as 2)\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=8,9 (freeway 4)\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=4\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nNow, times: T starts from 2.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nFor example, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nAt T=6, y=5,6,7 are unsafe.\n\nAt T=8 and 9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\ny=5,6,7 unsafe at T=6.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=4.\n\nNow, player at T=2, y=2, which is safe since T=2 not 8 or 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, I must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or go down to wait.\n\nBut since H should be minimal, I should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nNow, let's think about the unsafe periods.\n\nFirst, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, so I should not be on y=8 at T=4.\n\nAt T=6, y=5,6,7 are unsafe, so avoid being on them at T=6.\n\nAt T=8 and 9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, so avoid at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSince I start at T=2, y=2.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, let me consider the turns.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince I can move one step per turn, the minimal turns to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 turns if I go up every turn: at T=2, y=2; T=3, y=3; ... up to T=9, y=9? Start T=2 y=2, after one up: T=3 y=3, T=4 y=4, ..., T=9 y=9? From y=2 to y=3 at T=3, y=4 at T=4, ..., y=9 at T=9. So in 7 moves, from T=2 to T=9, y from 2 to 9.\n\nBut check if this path is safe.\n\nAt T=2, y=2: safe, as above.\n\nT=3, y=3: freeway 3, unsafe only at T=8,9, T=3 not, so safe.\n\nT=4, y=4: freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, T=4 not, safe.\n\nBut at T=4, if I am at y=4, but y=8 is unsafe, but I am on y=4, not y=8, so ok.\n\nIn this path: T=4, y=4.\n\nNow T=5, y=5: freeway 5, unsafe only at T=6? At T=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=6 only, so at T=5, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=6, y=6: freeway 6, unsafe at T=6, so at T=6, if on y=6, collision! Because unsafe at T=6.\n\nIn the direct path: at T=6, y=6, but freeway 6 is unsafe at T=6, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, T=7, y=7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=6, but T=7 not T=6, so should be safe? Freeway 7 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7, safe.\n\nBut at T=6, problem.\n\nAlso, later at T=8, y=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=4, not at T=8, so safe.\n\nT=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=6, y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo direct path not possible.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=2,3,4 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=6, I should not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nWhere can I be at T=6?\n\ny=0,1,8,9 are safe at T=6.\n\ny=0: no freeway, safe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, always safe.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe only at T=4, not T=6, so safe.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, so avoid y=8 at T=4.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at T=2, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at T=6, I must not be on y=5,6,7, I could be on lower or higher.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nI could go up slower or faster.\n\nMinimal H: since 7 moves needed, but with delays.\n\nI could be at y=1 or y=8 or something at critical times.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, from T=2, y=2.\n\nI can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U at T=2, to y=3 at T=3.\n\nOr S, stay y=2, or D to y=1.\n\nBut I need to go up, so D down might not help, but could to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, etc.\n\nNow, critical point: T=6, I need to avoid y=5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=6, I should be on y=0,1,8, or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, avoid y=8.\n\nAt T=4, y=8 unsafe, so I should not be on y=8 at T=4.\n\nAt T=8 and 9, avoid y=2,3,4.\n\nBut since I start low and go up, I might not be on low at late times if I go up fast.\n\nBut I have issue at T=6.\n\nNow, let's consider the time to reach.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, at T=9, y=9, as above.\n\nBut not possible because of T=6.\n\nI need to be not on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSo for T=6, I must be on y<=4 or y>=8.\n\ny<=4 or y>=8 at T=6.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4 or y=8,9.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 are unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but at T=6, they might be safe if not unsafe time.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 2,3,4: unsafe at T=8,9, so at T=6, they are safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7 unsafe at T=6, so not safe at T=6.\n\nSo at T=6, safe y: 0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nUnsafe: 5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nStart T=2, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on bad positions at critical times.\n\nNow, T=6 is critical.\n\nI need to be at y<=4 or y>=8 at T=6.\n\nIf I am at y<=4 at T=6, I need to go up to 9 later, which might take time, and I have to avoid T=8,9 on y=2,3,4.\n\nIf I am at y>=8 at T=6, I can go to y=9 quickly.\n\nBut y=8 at T=6 is safe, as above.\n\ny=9 at T=6 is also possible.\n\nBut I start from y=2, so to reach y=8 or 9 by T=6, I need to move up fast.\n\nT=2 to T=6 is 4 turns: from T=2 to T=6, I can make up to 4 moves.\n\nStart y=2 at T=2.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at T=6, y could be from 2-4= -2? But y min 0, max9.\n\ny at T=6: depending on actions from t=2 to t=5, since actions at t affect y at t+1? Let's see the player update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically, at time t, position is (0, y_t), and after action a_t, at time t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor the player, at turn T, we have y_T, and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at t_1+H-1, y=9.\n\nH is number of actions, from t= t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is after last action.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nStart: at turn t_1 =2, player is at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2).\n\nThen, for each turn t from t_1 onwards, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter action at t, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some t, and after the last action, at turn t+1, we have y_{t+1} =9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9? Let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nReach at turn when y=9.\n\nThe actions are applied from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after these H actions, at time t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=0, but start at y=2, not 9, so H>0.\n\nAt time t, after action a_{t-1}, we are at y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for next turn.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= T-1, to reach y_T=9.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - t_1.\n\nSince start at t_1 with y_{t_1}, after k actions, at time t_1 + k, y_{t_1 + k} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9, with H minimal.\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, start y_2=2.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T, with H = T - 2 actions from t=2 to t=T-1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal T, since H = T - 2, so minimal T to reach y=9.\n\nT from 3 onwards, y=9 possible.\n\nEarliest possible T=9 with direct up, but not possible.\n\nNow back to T=6.\n\nAt time T=6, we need y_6 such that it is safe, so y_6 not 5,6,7.\n\nSo y_6 <=4 or y_6 >=8.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, we need to be safe.\n\nNow, from start, at T=2, y=2, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some T.\n\nTo have small T, I should go up fast.\n\nBut to be safe at T=6, I need y_6 <=4 or y_6 >=8.\n\nIf I go up fast, I might be at high y at T=6.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn from T=2:\n\nAction at t=2: U, then y3=3\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: U, y6=6\n\nBut at T=6, y6=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=4, then at t=4, if I do S or D, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=6, y6=6 is bad.\n\nSo I need to be not at 5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nOne option: be at y=8 or 9 at T=6.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=2, to y=8 at T=6, I need to increase by 6 in 4 steps (from T=2 to T=6, actions at t=2,3,4,5 determine y3 to y6).\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,5 determine y3,y4,y5,y6.\n\ny6 depends on actions from t=2 to t=5.\n\nStart y2=2.\n\nAfter a2: y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nAfter a3: y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nAfter a4: y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nAfter a5: y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nTo have y6=8, for example.\n\ny6 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nMax sum of Δy over 4 actions is +4, so y6 <= 2+4=6, cannot reach 8 in 4 steps from y2=2.\n\nMinimal y6=2-4= -2, but y>=0, so 0.\n\nSo from T=2 to T=6, in 4 actions, y6 can be from 0 to 6.\n\nCannot reach y=7,8,9 at T=6.\n\nBecause to reach y=7 at T=6, need y6=7, which requires +5 in 4 actions, impossible since max +4, y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 or 9 impossible.\n\nSo at T=6, y6 <=6, and since y=5,6,7 unsafe, but y=7 possible? y6 max 6, so y6 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nUnsafe at T=6: y=5,6,7, but y=7 not possible at T=6, so only avoid y=5 and y=6.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=6, but since y6 <=6, it's impossible to be at y=7 at T=6, so only need to avoid y=5 and y=6 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is safe at T=6, etc.\n\nSo at T=6, y6 must not be 5 or 6, so y6 <=4 or y6=7 but impossible, so only y6 <=4 or y6>=8 impossible, so y6 <=4.\n\ny6 must be 0,1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSince y=5 and 6 unsafe, and 7 not reachable.\n\nSo at T=6, we must have y_6 <=4.\n\nThat is, at time 6, position y <=4.\n\nThen, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9, so we need to increase by at least 5, so at least 5 more actions.\n\nFor example, from y6 <=4, after actions, y7, y8, y9, etc.\n\nBut we have constraints at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\nSo if at T=6, y6 <=4, and say y6=4, then we can go up.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to avoid y=2,3,4.\n\nSince we are going up, if we can be above y=4 by T=8, we are safe.\n\nT=8 is soon after T=6.\n\nFrom T=6, y6 <=4, say y6=4.\n\nThen at t=6 action: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nBut at T=8, y8=6, which is freeway 6, unsafe at T=6, but T=8 is different, so should be safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=9 y9=7, freeway 7 unsafe only at T=6, safe.\n\nBut we reach y11=9 at T=11, with actions from t=2 to t=10? Let's list.\n\nStart T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to have y6 <=4.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=6, y6=4.\n\nThen to go to y=9.\n\ny7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions? H actions from t=t_1 to t_1+H-1, to reach y at t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,..., up to t=2+H-1.\n\nThen at time t=2+H, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=7, actions at t=2 to 8, y at t=3 to t=9.\n\ny3 to y9.\n\nTo have y9=9.\n\nBut earlier with direct, y9=9 possible but unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow, with y6=4, then y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 later.\n\nMinimal T for y=9.\n\nSince at T=6 we must be <=4, and we start at 2, we can be at y=4 at T=6 with minimal delay.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=6, go up: each up increases y by 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, so at least 5 actions, so y_{6+k} =4 + k for k=1,2,3,4,5, so y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nThus at T=11, y=9.\n\nWith actions from t=6 to t=10: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut we need to reach y6=4 first.\n\nFrom start y2=2 to y6=4 in 4 actions (t=2 to t=5).\n\ny6=4, with y2=2, so net increase +2 in 4 actions, which is possible, e.g., two U and two S, or three U and one D, etc.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each step.\n\nNow, also at T=8 and T=9, we need to avoid y=2,3,4.\n\nIn this path, at T=8, y8=6, which is not 2,3,4, so safe.\n\nT=9, y9=7, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nBut at T=6, y6=4, which is freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, but T=6 not, so safe.\n\nNow, what about other times.\n\nFor example, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, but in this path, at T=4, where are we?\n\nWe need to define the actions to reach y6=4.\n\ny2=2.\n\nActions t=2,3,4,5 to set y3,y4,y5,y6 with y6=4.\n\ny6 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 = 2 + sum Δy for t=2 to5.\n\nSet equal to 4, so sum Δy = +2.\n\nPossible sequences.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each T.\n\nNow, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, but if we are on y=8 at T=4, collision.\n\nIn this case, since we are going to y6=4, which is low, at T=4 we might be low.\n\nFor example, suppose we do some actions to have y4 low.\n\ny4 at T=4.\n\nIf y4 <=4, safe, since freeways 1-4 unsafe only at T=8,9 except for the critical times, but at T=4, freeway 4 is safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 unsafe at T=4, but if we are not on y=8, ok.\n\nNow, to have y6=4 with sum Δy= +2 over 4 actions.\n\nFor example, one way: go up directly but slower.\n\nBut we also have T=4 constraint.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe freeway-time pairs:\n\n- At T=4: y=8 unsafe\n\n- At T=6: y=5,6,7 unsafe\n\n- At T=8: y=2,3,4 unsafe\n\n- At T=9: y=2,3,4 unsafe\n\nOther times and freeways are safe.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nNow, for the path to y6=4.\n\ny2=2.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nI need to reach y6=4.\n\nOne simple: stay or move slowly.\n\nBut to minimize time, we might want to be higher earlier, but since we need to be low at T=6, it might not help for minimal T to 9.\n\nSince we have to be <=4 at T=6, and from there to 9 takes 5 turns, earliest T=11 for y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at T=6? Earlier we saw impossible, y6<=6.\n\nBut y6=4 is one option.\n\ny6=3 or 2 or 1 or 0 also possible, but lower might take more time to go up, so y6=4 is best.\n\ny6=4.\n\nThen from there, up to y11=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I go up faster before or after.\n\nBut before T=6, I start at y=2, T=2, to T=6, 4 turns, max y6=6, but I cannot be at 6 because unsafe, so y6<=4.\n\nIf I am at y6=4, then to y=9, need 5 up moves, T=11.\n\nIf I am at y6=3, then to y=9 need 6 up moves, worse.\n\nSimilarly, y6=4 is best.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=8 or 9 at T=6? Impossible, as established.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the critical point by being on safe freeway.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, be on y=1, which is always safe.\n\nBut y=1 at T=6, then to y=9 need 8 up moves, worse.\n\nSo y6=4 is better.\n\nNow, but we have T=4 and T=8,9 constraints.\n\nIn the path to y6=4, we need to ensure safety at each turn.\n\nAlso, at T=4, we need not to be on y=8.\n\nBut since we are going to y6=4, at T=4, y4 is likely low, so not y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart T=2, y=2.\n\nI need y6=4.\n\nSo actions from t=2 to t=5 to set y6=4.\n\ny6 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 = 4, so Δy2 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 = +2.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}.\n\nPossible combinations: for example, two U and two S: +1+1+0+0= +2\n\nOr three U and one D: +1+1+1-1= +2\n\nOr one U and three S, but +1+0+0+0= +1<2, not enough.\n\n+2 required.\n\nSo options: two U and two S, or three U and one D.\n\nNow, we need to assign which actions when.\n\nAlso, need to be safe at each T.\n\nNow, let's list y at each T.\n\ny2=2.\n\nThen after a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\nAt T=4, y4 !=8? Not on y=8 at T=4.\n\nBut y4, from y2=2, after two actions (t=2 and t=3), y4 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\ny4 can be from 0 to 4, since max +2 in two actions? Actions t=2 and t=3 affect y3 and y4.\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3 = y2 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\ny2=2, so y4 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\nΔy2 and Δy3 each in {-1,0,1}, so y4 from 0 to 4.\n\nSimilarly, y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nThen y6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nBut we want y6=4.\n\nSince y4 <=4 (as above, y4 <=4), and y6=4, so Δy4 + Δy5 = y6 - y4.\n\nBut y4 <=4, y6=4, so if y4 <4, then Δy4 + Δy5 >0, etc.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince y6=4, and y4 = 2 + Δy2 + Δy3, which is between 0 and 4.\n\nThen y6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 =4.\n\nSo Δy4 + Δy5 = 4 - y4.\n\nSince y4 <=4, 4-y4 >=0.\n\nIf y4=4, then Δy4 + Δy5=0, so both S or one U one D but cancel.\n\nIf y4=3, then Δy4 + Δy5=1, etc.\n\nNow, back to safety.\n\nAt T=4, y4 must not be 8, but y4 <=4, so y4=0,1,2,3,4 all !=8, so automatically not on y=8, so safe as long as on freeway safe.\n\nNow, for freeway, at T=4, y4 could be 1,2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=8,9, not T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 safe at T=4.\n\nSo all possible y4 are safe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, at other times before T=6.\n\nNow, at T=6, y6=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, not T=6, safe.\n\nNow, after that, from T=6, y6=4, we go up to y=9.\n\nActions: to increase y from 4 to 9, need 5 up moves.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each step.\n\nNow, y7=5, at T=7.\n\nT=7, freeway 5: unsafe at T=6, not T=7, so safe.\n\ny8=6, T=8, freeway 6: unsafe at T=6, not T=8, so safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, but we are on y=6, not 2,3,4, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, y9=7, T=9, freeway 7 unsafe at T=6, not T=9, safe.\n\ny10=8, T=10, freeway 8 unsafe at T=4, not T=10, safe.\n\ny11=9, T=11, safe.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the actions to reach y6=4.\n\nFor example, with two U and two S.\n\ny2=2.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nt=2: S, then y3=2 +0=2? Action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at T=2, y=2.\n\nThen a2: if S, Δy=0, so y3=2+0=2\n\nIf U, y3=3\n\nIf D, y3=1\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to have y6=4.\n\nFor example, one sequence: all move up but with some stay.\n\nSince we need net +2 in 4 actions.\n\nE.g., a2: U, y3=3\n\na3: U, y4=4\n\nNow y4=4.\n\nThen we need y6=4.\n\ny6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSet y6=4, so Δy4 + Δy5 =0.\n\nSo for example, a4: S, y5= y4 +0=4\n\na5: S, y6=4 +0=4\n\nOr a4: U, y5=5, then a5: D, y6=4\n\nBut that might be unnecessary.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point unsafe.\n\nIn this sequence: T=2, y=2, safe.\n\na2: U, then at T=3, y=3, freeway 3, safe since T=3 not 8 or 9.\n\na3: U, then at T=4, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\na4: S, then at T=5, y=5? a4 action at t=4, sets y5.\n\nAfter a3 (t=3), y4=4.\n\nThen a4: if S, Δy=0, y5=4+0=4\n\nThen at T=5, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=8,9, not T=5, safe.\n\nThen a5: S, y6=4+0=4\n\nAt T=6, y=4, safe as above.\n\nThen from there, to go up:\n\na6: U, then at T=7, y=5\n\na7: U, T=8, y=6\n\na8: U, T=9, y=7\n\na9: U, T=10, y=8\n\na10: U, T=11, y=9\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nT=7, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at T=6, not T=7, safe.\n\nT=8, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at T=6, not T=8, safe. Also, y=2,3,4 unsafe at T=8, but we are at y=6, not those, so fine.\n\nT=9, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe only at T=6, safe; and y=2,3,4 unsafe but not here.\n\nT=10, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at T=4, not T=10, safe.\n\nT=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, actions: from t=2 to t=10.\n\nt=2: a2=U? In the sequence above, a2=U (to y3=3)\n\na3=U (to y4=4)\n\na4=S (to y5=4)\n\na5=S (to y6=4)\n\na6=U (to y7=5)\n\na7=U (to y8=6)\n\na8=U (to y9=7)\n\na9=U (to y10=8)\n\na10=U (to y11=9)\n\nBut we reached y11=9 at T=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 9 actions.\n\nH actions: from t=t_1 to t_1+H-1, here t_1=2, so t=2 to 2+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H = 2 + H, y=9.\n\nSo 2+H=11, H=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal H, but with direct it was 7 but not possible.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before T=11.\n\nBut since at T=6 I must be <=4, and to go from 4 to 9 needs 5 steps, so T=6 +5 =11, earliest.\n\nT=6 at y<=4, then after 5 actions, y_{11}=9.\n\nIf I can be at y=4 at T=5 or earlier, but T=6 is fixed.\n\nAt T=6, y<=4.\n\nIf I reach y=4 earlier, say at T=5, but I still need to be at y<=4 at T=6, so if at T=5 y=4, I might stay or something, but still go up later.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=5, y=4.\n\nThen at T=6, I need y6<=4, so if y5=4, I can do S or D to keep y6<=4, but D would make it lower, then need more up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y5=4, I need to go to y6, then to y9.\n\ny5=4 at T=5.\n\nThen to y=9, minimal at T=10: y5=4, a5:U, y6=5, but y6=5 at T=6 is unsafe! Collision.\n\nBecause at T=6, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo if at T=5, y=4, and I go up to y6=5, unsafe.\n\nI could stay: a5:S, y6=4, safe.\n\nThen from y6=4, same as before, to y11=9.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nBut at T=5, y=4, which is safe.\n\nBut I cannot go up directly at t=5 because y6=5 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to stay or go down at t=5 to keep y6<=4.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut still, to reach y=9, it takes same or more time.\n\nFor example, start: suppose I go up faster to T=4.\n\ny2=2, a2:U, y3=3\n\na3:U, y4=4\n\nNow at T=4, y=4.\n\nThen a4: ? If I do U, y5=5, but at T=5, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at T=6? At T=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=6, so at T=5, safe.\n\nThen y5=5 at T=5.\n\nThen at t=5, action: if I do U, y6=6, but T=6 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I do S, y6=5, still unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf I do D, y6=4, safe.\n\nSo a4:U to y5=5 (safe at T=5)\n\nThen a5:D to y6=4 (safe at T=6)\n\nThen from y6=4, same as before: a6:U to y7=5, a7:U to y8=6, a8:U to y9=7, a9:U to y10=8, a10:U to y11=9.\n\nBut now at T=9, y=7, not 9.\n\nReached at T=11 same as before.\n\nBut actions: a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=D, a6=U, etc.\n\nCompared to previous with two S, here I used D, but still H=9.\n\nIn previous, with a4=S and a5=S, I had y5=4 and y6=4.\n\nHere with a4=U and a5=D, y5=5 and y6=4.\n\nBut at T=5, y=5 is safe, as above.\n\nBut no gain.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than T=11?\n\nSuppose at T=6, I am at y=4.\n\nThen the soonest to y=9 is T=11.\n\nIf I am at lower y at T=6, worse.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=8 or something safe at T=6? Impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid being on the critical freeways at critical times by moving differently.\n\nFor example, at T=6, instead of being low, but I have to be <=4.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 or something to avoid, but that might not help.\n\nOr, since y=1 is always safe, but starting from y=2, if I go down to y=1, then I need to go up more.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=2, I could go down to y=1 at some point, but why.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 before T=6, but from y=2 at T=2, to y=9, min 7 actions, T=9.\n\nBut at T=6, if I am at y=9, but to be at y=9 at T=6, I need y6=9, which requires from y2=2, +7 in 4 actions, impossible.\n\nMax y6=6.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, minimal T to reach y=9 is 11, with y11=9.\n\nNow, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions that include S or D, but I can choose a sequence with no down, for example.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had two S: a4=S and a5=S.\n\nI could have three U and one D, but D might not be necessary.\n\nFor example, to have y6=4.\n\ny2=2.\n\na2:U, y3=3\n\na3:U, y4=4\n\nThen y4=4.\n\nNow y6=4, so need Δy4 + Δy5=0.\n\nIf a4:U, y5=5\n\nThen a5:D, y6=4\n\nAs above.\n\nOr a4:S, y5=4\n\na5:S, y6=4\n\nOr a4:D, y5=3\n\nThen a5:U, y6=4, etc.\n\nBut with down, it might be worse if I go lower, but in this case same.\n\nNow, to avoid down, I can use stay.\n\nIn the up phase, from y6=4 to y11=9, I go up every turn.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at T=8 and T=9, we are at y=6 and y=7, which are safe.\n\nBut the constraint was to avoid y=2,3,4 at T=8 and T=9, which we are not on.\n\nNow, but in this path, we used 9 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if H can be less.\n\nSuppose I try to reach y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen y10=9.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny6 <=4, so y10 <= 4 + 4*1 = 8, since max increase 4 in 4 actions, so y10 <=8 if y6<=4, cannot reach 9.\n\ny6 <=4, then after 4 actions, y10 <= 4+4=8 <9, so impossible to reach y=9 by T=10 if y6<=4.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y9 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8\n\ny6<=4, so y9 <=4+3=7<9, impossible.\n\nT=8: y8 <=4+2=6<9.\n\nT=7: y7 <=4+1=5<9.\n\nSo indeed, earliest possible is T=11 with y11=9.\n\nThus H=9 actions: from t=2 to t=10.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, one option:\n\na2: U  (to y3=3)\n\na3: U  (to y4=4)\n\na4: S  (to y5=4)  // since y4=4, S to keep\n\na5: S  (to y6=4)  // keep at 4\n\nBut at T=5, y=4, which is safe.\n\na6: U  (to y7=5)\n\na7: U  (to y8=6)\n\na8: U  (to y9=7)\n\na9: U  (to y10=8)\n\na10: U  (to y11=9)\n\nNow, all safe as per above.\n\nTo have fewer stay, but I need to have y6=4.\n\nSince I have to have sum Δy=+2 from t=2 to t=5 for y6=4.\n\ny6=4, y2=2, so over actions t=2,3,4,5, Δy sum +2.\n\nIn the actions, I used a4 and a5 both S, which is fine.\n\nI could do: a2: U, y3=3\n\na3: S, y4=3\n\nThen need y6=4.\n\ny4=3, so Δy4 + Δy5 =1\n\nFor example, a4: U, y5=4\n\na5: S, y6=4\n\nThen a6 to a10 same.\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nBut in all cases, 9 actions.\n\nNow, the answer should be a sequence from t=2 to t=10.\n\nBut t_1=2, so actions from t=2 to t=10, that's t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for the up part, I go directly.\n\nBut is there a way to skip some levels faster? No, since only one step per turn.\n\nAnother thing: at T=4, y=8 unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=4, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 8 unsafe at T=4, but not relevant.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used two S at a4 and a5.\n\nTo make it without stay, but not necessary.\n\nI could go to y=4 earlier.\n\nFor example, a2: U, y3=3\n\na3: U, y4=4\n\nThen a4: U, y5=5\n\nBut at T=5, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a5: D, y6=4 (since we need y6=4)\n\nThen a6: U, y7=5\n\na7: U, y8=6\n\na8: U, y9=7\n\na9: U, y10=8\n\na10: U, y11=9\n\nSame as before, but with a5=D instead of S.\n\nBut D might be less desirable, but possible.\n\nIn terms of minimal H, same.\n\nBut with S, no down move.\n\nIn the first sequence with S, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nThe minimal H is 9.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 2: a2\n\nTurn 3: a3\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 10: a10\n\nIn the sequence I have.\n\nBut let's write clearly.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U  // to y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U  // to y4=4\n\nTurn 4: S  // to y5=4\n\nTurn 5: S  // to y6=4\n\nTurn 6: U  // to y7=5\n\nTurn 7: U  // to y8=6\n\nTurn 8: U  // to y9=7\n\nTurn 9: U  // to y10=8\n\nTurn 10: U  // to y11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=9.\n\nAll positions safe as checked.\n\nTo have different actions to reach y6=4.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: U // y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S // y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U // y5=4\n\nTurn 5: S // y6=4\n\nThen same up.\n\nOr Turn 2: S // y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U // y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U // y5=4\n\nTurn 5: S // y6=4\n\nBut this has S at start, might delay, but same T to reach y=9.\n\nIn this, y5=4, then a5:S to y6=4.\n\nBut with the first, I was higher earlier, but doesn't matter for final time.\n\nI think any sequence with y6=4 and then up is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, during the up phase, at T=8, y=6, which is safe, but freeway 6, and at T=9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 faster? I think not.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nIn this sequence, we are not on y=8 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 5 has two cars, but we saw only one affects, etc.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 always safe, we can use it, but in this path, we didn't go to y=1, but could, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 9. This requires a sequence of 9 actions from turn 2 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Unsafe Freeway-Times**:\n  - Freeway 8 is unsafe at turn 4 (due to a car at x=0).\n  - Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are unsafe at turn 6 (due to cars at x=0).\n  - Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9 (due to cars at x=0).\n- **Player Movement**: The player must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at the specified turn. Specifically:\n  - At turn 6, the player must not be on freeways 5, 6, or 7. Given that the maximum y achievable by turn 6 is 6 (from y=2 in 4 actions), and y=5 and y=6 are unsafe, the player must be at y ≤ 4 (i.e., y=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) at turn 6.\n  - From y ≤ 4 at turn 6, it takes at least 5 up moves to reach y=9, leading to a minimal arrival at turn 11 (i.e., after 9 actions from turn 2).\n- **Optimal Path**: The sequence starts by reaching y=4 by turn 6 safely, then moving up directly to y=9. The chosen actions ensure the player is never on an unsafe freeway at the critical turns:\n  - Turns 2-5: Actions are chosen to reach y=4 by turn 6, avoiding unsafe states (e.g., at turn 4, y=8 is unsafe, but the player is at lower y).\n  - Turns 6-10: Actions move the player up from y=4 to y=9, avoiding unsafe freeways at turns 8 and 9 (player is at y=6 and y=7, which are safe at those turns).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for turns \\(t = 2\\) to \\(t = 10\\) (9 actions) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 2: U (move up to y=3 at turn 3)  \n- Turn 3: U (move up to y=4 at turn 4)  \n- Turn 4: S (stay at y=4 for turn 5)  \n- Turn 5: S (stay at y=4 for turn 6)  \n- Turn 6: U (move up to y=5 at turn 7)  \n- Turn 7: U (move up to y=6 at turn 8)  \n- Turn 8: U (move up to y=7 at turn 9)  \n- Turn 9: U (move up to y=8 at turn 10)  \n- Turn 10: U (move up to y=9 at turn 11)  \n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- **Turn 3 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; safe at turn 3.\n- **Turn 4 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; safe at turn 4. Also, y=8 is unsafe at turn 4, but player is at y=4, not y=8.\n- **Turn 5 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; safe at turn 5.\n- **Turn 6 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; safe at turn 6. Player avoids y=5,6,7 (unsafe at turn 6).\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 6; safe at turn 7.\n- **Turn 8 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 6; safe at turn 8. Also, y=2,3,4 are unsafe at turn 8, but player is at y=6.\n- **Turn 9 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 6; safe at turn 9. Also, y=2,3,4 are unsafe at turn 9, but player is at y=7.\n- **Turn 10 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 4; safe at turn 10.\n- **Turn 11 (y=9)**: y=9 is always safe (no freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 11 with H=9, the minimal possible due to the constraints at turn 6.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I'm starting at y=4.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, the cars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each car, I have its position at turn t=4, and I need to find where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nA collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at turn T. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_0 = 4 for simplicity, since all times are relative to t_1.\n\nAt turn T, if the player is at position (0, y_T), and y_T is between 1 and 8, then for the car on freeway y_T, if 0 is within the car's span at that exact turn T, there's a collision.\n\nAlso, note that if you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until turn T+1. So at turn T, when you move, you are still on the previous y for collision purposes.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, you are at y_t, and you choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then at turn t+1, you move to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so you might collide with cars on y_T if 0 is in span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the span for cars is given at t=4, and for future turns, it changes based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t=4:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, speed s=3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_0), h + s(t - t_0)] for t > t_0, but t_0=4.\n\nGeneral rule: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (60,49, right, 3) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (-24,-35, right, 6) — tail τ=-35, head h=-24? Usually head is the front, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] then [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head=60, tail=49, direction right, so at t_1, span is [49,60] I think? But it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so yes, span is from tail to head, [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] but all here are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: head=-24, tail=-35, direction right, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,4) at turn 4.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and no cars on y=9, I think, because freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and I don't need to be on freeway anymore.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when y=9, no collision possible since no cars there.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, so I need to move up, but I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8 when I'm on those rows.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and want to go to y=9, I should probably move up as much as possible, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to increase y by 5 (from 4 to 9), if I move up every turn, it would take 5 turns: turn 4 to turn 8, y=4,5,6,7,8,9 at turn 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart turn t=4, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to go from y=4 to y=9, I need to increase by 5, so if I do U every turn, it takes 5 actions: from turn 4 to turn 8, I do U,U,U,U,U, then at turn 9, y=9.\n\nSequence: at turn 4, action a4, then y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t=4, I am at y=4. I choose a4, which determines y5.\n\nThen at turn t=5, I am at y5, choose a5, determines y6, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince I start at t=4 y=4, the earliest to reach y=9 is at t=9 with y=9, by moving up every turn: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8 all U, then at t=9 y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is safe, i.e., no collisions when on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if on freeway y_T (1-8) and 0 in span of car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn this path, I would be on y=4 at t=4, y=5 at t=5, ..., y=8 at t=8, and y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo I need to check for t=4 to t=8, when I am on y=4,5,6,7,8 respectively.\n\nNow, for each of these turns and freeways, check if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=4 at turn t=4.\n\nBut freeway 4 has cars? Let's see the car state.\n\nFreeway 4: from table, it has (-24,-35, right, 6) — only one car? Let's list per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=60, tail=49, right, s=3)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=6) — is that right? The table says for freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-24,-35,right,6) again.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same two cars? (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor freeway 4, it has one car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 2 and 3.\n\nNow, at turn t=4, I am on y=4, so for freeway 4, is 0 in span at t=4?\n\nSpan at t=4 for freeway 4 car: since right-moving, span = [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] but T=t_1=4, so T-t_1=0, so span = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 is not in [-35,-24], since -35 to -24, all negative, 0 is greater, so 0 not in span, so no collision at t=4 on y=4.\n\nNow, at t=5, I am on y=5, assuming I moved up.\n\ny=5 at t=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=12)\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] for each.\n\nT=5, T-4=1, so for first car: [ -35 + 12*1, -24 + 12*1 ] = [ -35+12, -24+12 ] = [-23, -12]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), span at T=5: [37 + 12*1, 48 + 12*1] = [37+12, 48+12] = [49, 60]\n\nNow, 0 is not in [-23,-12] nor in [49,60], so no collision on y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=6, I am on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: same as above, (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nAt T=6, T-4=2\n\nFirst car: [-35 +12*2, -24 +12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included, since it's a closed interval? The span is [lower, upper], and collision if 0 in span, so if lower <= 0 <= upper.\n\nHere [-11, 0], 0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0, so 0 is in the span.\n\nSo at t=6, on freeway 6, for the first car, span is [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nSo collision would occur if I am on y=6 at t=6.\n\nIn my path, at t=6, I would be on y=6, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nSo the direct up path has a problem at t=6 on y=6.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other points, but for now, this is blocked.\n\nAt t=7, if I were on y=7, freeway 7 cars: same two types.\n\nAt T=7, T-4=3\n\nFirst car: [-35 +12*3, -24 +12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12]\n\n0 not in [1,12]\n\nSecond car: [37+12*3, 48+12*3] = [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=7 on y=7, no collision if I were there.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, freeway 8 cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nAt T=8, T-4=4\n\nFirst car: head=0? (0,-11,right,12), so tail τ=-11, head h=0? Direction right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nThen at T, span = [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-11 +12*(T-4), 0 +12*(T-4)]\n\nAt T=8, [-11 +12*4, 0 +12*4]? T-4=4, so [-11 + 48, 0 + 48] = [37, 48]\n\nSecond car: [37 +12*4, 48 +12*4] = [37+48, 48+48] = [85,96]\n\nAt T=8, for first car: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=6 on y=6, we have collision.\n\nSo direct up path not possible because at t=6 on y=6, collision.\n\nI need to either not be on y=6 at t=6, or be on y=6 at a different time when no collision.\n\nSince the cars move, the spans change, so I might wait or change speed.\n\nPossible actions: I can stay (S) to delay, or move down (D) to go to a safer row, but since I need to go up eventually, moving down might not be efficient.\n\nI could move up slower or faster to avoid the collision times.\n\nNow, the collision at y=6 t=6 is because of the car on freeway 6 with span [-11,0] at t=6.\n\nThat car comes from freeway 6, first car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt t=4, span [-35,-24]\n\nAt t=5, [-23,-12]\n\nAt t=6, [-11,0] — includes 0\n\nAt t=7, [1,12] — no 0\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, at t=4, the car (0,-11,right,12) has span [-11,0] at t=4, which includes 0, but at t=4, I am on y=4, not y=8, so no issue.\n\nAt t=4, on y=4, freeway 4 has car with span [-35,-24], no 0.\n\nBut for y=8 at t=4, if I were there, but I'm not.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nI need to reach y=9 from y=4.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, H=5 turns, but with obstacle, it might take more.\n\nI could go up but skip y=6 at t=6, for example by staying on y=5 longer or moving to y=6 later or earlier.\n\ny=6 at t=6 is bad.\n\nWhat times is y=6 safe?\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: span at time T: [ -35 + 12(T-4), -24 + 12(T-4) ]\n\nSet lower bound L1(T) = -35 + 12(T-4)\n\nUpper bound U1(T) = -24 + 12(T-4)\n\n0 in span if L1(T) <= 0 <= U1(T)\n\nSimilarly second car on freeway 6: (48,37,right,12), span [37 +12(T-4), 48 +12(T-4)]\n\nL2(T) = 37 +12(T-4)\n\nU2(T) = 48 +12(T-4)\n\nSince L2(T) starts at T=4, L2=37>0, and increases, so U2(T) > L2(T) >0 for T>=4, so 0 never in second car span. Only first car can have 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: L1(T) = -35 +12(T-4)\n\nU1(T) = -24 +12(T-4)\n\n0 in span when L1(T) <= 0 and U1(T) >=0\n\nL1(T) <=0: -35 +12(T-4) <=0 => 12(T-4) <=35 => T-4 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so T-4 <=2 since T integer, T-4 <=2, T<=6\n\nSimilarly U1(T) >=0: -24 +12(T-4) >=0 => 12(T-4) >=24 => T-4 >=2, T>=6\n\nSo L1(T)<=0 for T<=6, U1(T)>=0 for T>=6\n\nThus 0 in span when T=6, exactly, since for T=6, L1= -35+12*2= -35+24=-11<=0, U1= -24+24=0>=0\n\nFor T=5, L1=-23, U1=-12, both <0, 0 not <= U1? U1=-12<0, so 0 > U1, not in span\n\nFor T=7, L1=1>0, U1=12>0, 0 < L1, not in span.\n\nSo only at T=6, for freeway 6, first car has 0 in span.\n\nTherefore, collision on y=6 only at turn T=6 if I am there.\n\nFor other freeways, I need to check when 0 is in span.\n\nBut for now, on y=6, it is unsafe only at t=6.\n\nAt other times, it might be safe.\n\nFor example, at t=5, on y=6: freeway 6 cars at t=5: first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in; second car [49,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt t=7, first car [1,12], 0 not in; second car [73,84], safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, freeway 6 at t=4: first car [-35,-24], no; second car [37,48]? At t=4, T-4=0, span [37,48], no 0.\n\nSo y=6 is safe except at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at t=4, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nOne way: I could stay on y=4 or y=5 for an extra turn to avoid being on y=6 at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, I could stay (S) or move up (U).\n\nIf I move up at t=4, to y=5 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars at t=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars: first (-24,-35,right,12) span at t=5: T=5, T-4=1, [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12]\n\nSecond (48,37,right,12) [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]\n\n0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 for t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=6, but not at t=6.\n\nSo at t=5, I could move to y=6 at t=6, but t=6 on y=6 is bad.\n\nI could stay on y=5 at t=5, so y=5 still at t=6? No.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action, then y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=5, I am at y=5, I choose a5.\n\nIf a5 = S, then y6 = y5 =5, so at t=6, I am at y=5.\n\nIf a5 = U, then y6=6, at t=6 on y=6.\n\nBut y=6 at t=6 is collision, so I cannot do U at t=5.\n\nI could do D, but that might not help.\n\nSo at t=5, I should do S, so that at t=6, I am still at y=5.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5 at t=6: T=6, T-4=2\n\nFirst car: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]\n\n0 is in [-11,0], so at t=6 on y=5, for freeway 5, first car has 0 in span, so collision.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt t=6, on y=5, freeway 5 has car with span [-11,0] at t=6, so 0 in span, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=4 at some point.\n\nLet me list for each freeway and time when 0 is in span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, and I need to be on a freeway only when 0 not in car span for that freeway at that time.\n\nFor freeway k, find times T where 0 is in some car span on that row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (60,49,right,3)\n\nSpan: [49 + 3(T-4), 60 + 3(T-4)] since right-moving.\n\nL1(T) = 49 + 3(T-4)\n\nU1(T) = 60 + 3(T-4)\n\nL1(T) >0 for all T>=4, since at T=4, L1=49>0, so 0 never in span for freeway 1. Always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: car (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSpan: [-35 +6(T-4), -24 +6(T-4)]\n\nL2(T) = -35 +6(T-4)\n\nU2(T) = -24 +6(T-4)\n\n0 in span if L2<=0 and U2>=0\n\nL2<=0: -35 +6(T-4) <=0 => 6(T-4) <=35 => T-4 <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so T-4 <=5, T<=9\n\nU2>=0: -24 +6(T-4) >=0 => 6(T-4) >=24 => T-4 >=4, T>=8\n\nSo L2<=0 for T<=9, U2>=0 for T>=8, thus 0 in span when T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor T=8: L2= -35+6*4= -35+24= -11 <=0, U2= -24+24=0 >=0\n\nT=9: L2= -35+6*5= -35+30= -5 <=0, U2= -24+30=6 >=0\n\nT=10: L2= -35+36=1>0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 2, 0 in span at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (-24,-35,right,6), so same as freeway 2, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-24,-35,right,6), unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), span [-35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4)]\n\nL5a(T) = -35 +12(T-4)\n\nU5a(T) = -24 +12(T-4)\n\n0 in span when L5a<=0 and U5a>=0\n\nL5a<=0: -35+12(T-4)<=0 => 12(T-4)<=35 => T-4<=35/12≈2.916, T<=6\n\nU5a>=0: -24+12(T-4)>=0 => 12(T-4)>=24 => T-4>=2, T>=6\n\nSo only at T=6: L5a= -35+24= -11<=0, U5a= -24+24=0>=0\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), span [37+12(T-4),48+12(T-4)] all positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: as before, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars, same as 5 and 6? (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car same as above, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSecond car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: at t_1, head=0, tail=-11, so span at T: [-11 +12(T-4), 0 +12(T-4)] = [-11 +12(T-4), 12(T-4)]\n\nL8a(T) = -11 +12(T-4)\n\nU8a(T) = 12(T-4)\n\n0 in span if L8a<=0 and U8a>=0\n\nU8a(T) = 12(T-4) >=0 for all T>=4, since T-4>=0.\n\nL8a<=0: -11 +12(T-4) <=0 => 12(T-4) <=11 => T-4 <= 11/12 <1, so T-4 <=0, T<=4\n\nAt T=4, L8a= -11 +0 = -11 <=0, U8a=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>4, L8a = -11 +12(T-4) > -11 +12*1 =1>0 for T>=5, so L8a>0, 0 not <= L8a? Since L8a>0, 0 < L8a, not in span.\n\nAt T=4, U8a=0, so 0 is included.\n\nBut at T=4, for freeway 8, if I am on y=8, but at t=4 I am on y=4, not issue.\n\nSecond car always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe only at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, I am not on y=8.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=6\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=4 (but not relevant for us)\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=4, which is past.\n\nNow, for the player, I need to be on y=1 to 8 only when not unsafe for that row and time.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, if I am on y_T between 1 and 8, it must be that for that y_T, at time T, 0 not in car span, i.e., not unsafe as above.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\ny=5,6,7 unsafe only at T=6.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=4 is safe, since unsafe only at 8,9.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly, but we saw problem at t=6.\n\nI could stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nOr move to y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=6.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 all unsafe only at t=6, I need to not be on rows 5,6,7 at t=6.\n\nThat means at t=6, I should be on y<=4 or y>=8.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are safe, but y=0 might not be desirable.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=6: is it safe?\n\ny=8, freeway 8, at t=6: as above, for freeway 8, unsafe only at t=4, so at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=6: freeway 4, unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=6, safe.\n\ny=3,2,1 similarly safe at t=6.\n\nSo at t=6, I can be on y=1,2,3,4 or 8,9 but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=8 is ok.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart t=4, y=4.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, I must be on y<=4 or y=8.\n\nSince I start at y=4, I could stay on low rows or jump to high.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up eventually.\n\nOption 1: stay on y=4 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, do S, so at t=5, y=4? At t=4, action S, then y5 = y4 +0 =4, so at t=5, position y=4.\n\nAt t=5, on y=4, freeway 4: at t=5, T=5, unsafe? y=4 unsafe at T=8,9, so at t=5, safe.\n\nI can do S again at t=5, so y6=4, at t=6 on y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=6, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=6, I can start moving up.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are unsafe only at t=6, which is past, so for t>6, they might be safe.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=5: freeway 5, unsafe only at t=6, so at t=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7 at t=7 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=7 safe, etc.\n\nSo from t=6 y=4, I can do U at t=6, to y=7? Actions: U to +1, D to -1, S to 0.\n\nSo at t=6, y=4, I can do U, then y7=5\n\nOr U multiple times.\n\nBut y=5 at t=7 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I need to be careful with y=2,3,4 at t=8 or 9 if I delay.\n\nSince I start at t=4, if I stay at y=4 for two turns: t=4 and t=5 both S.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=4: start y=4, action S, so y5=4\n\nTurn t=5: at y=4, action S, so y6=4\n\nNow at t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can move up.\n\nAt t=6, action U, so y7 = y6 +1 =5\n\nAt t=7, y=5, which is safe since y=5 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, action U, y8=6\n\nAt t=8, y=6, now y=6 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=8, should be safe? y=6 freeway, at t=8: freeway 6 cars.\n\nFirst car: at T=8, T-4=4, span [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], no. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=6, action U, y9=7\n\nAt t=9, y=7, freeway 7 at t=9: T=9, T-4=5\n\nFirst car: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at t=9, action U, y10=8\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8 at t=10: T=10, T-4=6\n\nFirst car: [-11+12*6, 0+12*6]? Car (0,-11,right,12), span at T: [-11 +12(T-4), 12(T-4)]\n\nAt T=10, [-11+72, 72] = [61,72], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at t=10, action U, y11=9, reached.\n\nBut at t=11, y=9, not on freeway, done.\n\nNow, turns: from t=4 to t=10, I reached at t=11 y=9.\n\nActions: t=4: S, t=5: S, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nNumber of actions: 7 actions, H=7 turns? From t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions: a4 to a10, and at t=11 y=9.\n\nBut t=11 is the turn after last action.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=4 to t=10, H=7 actions.\n\nBut minimal H? Earlier direct was 5 but blocked, this is 7, which is more.\n\nI could move faster.\n\nSince at t=6 I need to be not on 5,6,7, I could be on y=8 at t=6.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=4 to y=8 at t=6, that means moving up quickly.\n\nAt t=4, y=4, if I do U, then y5=5\n\nAt t=5, y=5, if I do U, y6=6, but y=6 at t=6 is bad.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=5, I could do nothing or down, but down to y=4, same as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=6.\n\ny6=8.\n\nBut from y4=4, to y6=8, I need +4 in two actions.\n\nPossible only if I do U and U, but from y4=4, a4=U, y5=5; a5=U, y6=6, not 8.\n\nCannot jump, only change by 1 per turn, so maximum y6=6 if start y4=4 and U,U.\n\ny6 cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, minimum y6=4 if S,S or D,S etc.\n\nSo at t=6, possible y from 2 to 6, since y4=4, after two actions, y6 can be from 4-2=2 to 4+2=6.\n\nSo y=2,3,4,5,6 possible at t=6.\n\nBut y=5 or 6 at t=6 is unsafe, y=4 is safe as before.\n\ny=3 at t=6: freeway 3, unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so staying low might delay.\n\nAnother option: go to y=8 quickly after t=6.\n\nBut at t=6 I am at y=4 or less.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=6, I can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I should minimize waiting.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 or something, but that might not help.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nBut going down takes extra turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 unsafe only at t=6, I can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=5 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=5: is it safe?\n\nAt t=5, on y=6, freeway 6 at t=5: T=5, first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in; second [49,60], no, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at t=5: freeway 7 at t=5, same as y=6 at t=5, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=5: freeway 8 at t=5, as before, unsafe only at t=4, so safe.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I do U at t=4, to y5=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, which is safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, I want to go to y=6, but if I do U, y6=6, but t=6 on y=6 unsafe.\n\nI could do something else.\n\nAt t=5, on y=5, I can do S, so y6=5, but at t=6 on y=5, unsafe, as we saw earlier for y=5 at t=6.\n\ny=5 at t=6 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I do D at t=5, y6=4, then safe at t=6 on y=4.\n\nBut then I have to go up from there.\n\nLet's see the time.\n\nStart t=4 y=4.\n\nOption: t=4: U, so y5=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nTo avoid y=5 at t=6, I must not stay, so I can go up or down.\n\nIf go up, U, y6=6, but unsafe at t=6.\n\nIf down, D, y6=4, then at t=6 on y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 at t=6, then I can U at t=6, y7=5\n\nBut at t=7, y=5, which is safe since only unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, U at t=7, y8=6, at t=8 y=6 safe.\n\nThen U at t=8, y9=7, at t=9 y=7 safe.\n\nU at t=9, y10=8, at t=10 y=8 safe.\n\nU at t=10, y11=9.\n\nAgain, actions from t=4 to t=10, 7 actions, same as before.\n\nBut at t=5, instead of D, I did S in first plan, but here I did U then D, which is similar.\n\nIn terms of y, same path almost.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I can be on higher y faster after t=6.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=6, I can do U multiple times, but each U only +1, so y7=5, y8=6, etc, cannot faster.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 or 9 before t=8 or 9 to avoid y=2,3,4 unsafe times.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 unsafe at t=8,9, so if I am not on them at those times.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and y=9 is safe, I should aim to be on high rows early.\n\nBut to be on high rows, I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nLet's list the safe times to be on each row.\n\nFor y=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except t=8,9\n\ny=3: safe except t=8,9\n\ny=4: safe except t=8,9\n\ny=5: safe except t=6\n\ny=6: safe except t=6\n\ny=7: safe except t=6\n\ny=8: safe except t=4 (which is past)\n\nSo for y=5,6,7, only t=6 is bad.\n\nFor y=2,3,4, t=8,9 bad.\n\nI start at t=4 y=4, safe.\n\nI can stay on y=4 until t=7, for example.\n\nAt t=7, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=7, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, so I need to not be on them at t=8 or 9.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at t=7, I can move up.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are safe after t=6.\n\nSo at t=7, y=4, I do U, y8=5, at t=8 on y=5.\n\ny=5 at t=8: safe, since unsafe only t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I can U to y9=6, at t=9 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y10=7, U to y11=8, U to y12=9.\n\nBut at t=9 on y=6 is fine, but I reach y=9 at t=12, which is later.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo avoid being on low rows at t=8,9, I need to be on y>=5 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, I must be on y=5,6,7,8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are freeways, but safe at t=8 except for the unsafe times, but at t=8, y=5,6,7 are safe, y=8 safe.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo if I can be on y>=5 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for t=9.\n\nNow, at t=4, y=4.\n\nI have turns t=4,5,6,7 to move before t=8.\n\nAt t=8, I need to be at y>=5.\n\nCurrent y=4 at t=4.\n\nAfter actions at t=4,5,6,7, I set y5,y6,y7,y8.\n\ny8 is position at turn t=8.\n\nI need y8 >=5.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 fast.\n\nMinimal actions to increase y.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are only unsafe at t=6, I can be on them at t=5 or t=7, for example.\n\nAt t=5, y=5 is safe.\n\nAt t=7, y=5 is safe.\n\nAt t=6, must not be on 5,6,7.\n\nSo one plan: be on y=5 at t=5, then at t=5, since I can't stay on y=5 at t=6, I must move to y=4 or y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=6 bad, so move to y=4.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=6, move up.\n\nBut as before, takes time.\n\nBe on y=7 at t=5, then at t=5, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I need to move to avoid y=7 at t=6.\n\nIf I move to y=8, then at t=6 on y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=9.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom start: at t=4, y=4.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=5? y5=7.\n\nBut from y4=4, to y5=7, I need to increase by 3 in one action, impossible, max +1 per action.\n\nSo y5 can be 3,4,5.\n\nCannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=6, impossible from y4=4 in two actions.\n\nMax y6=6.\n\nSo only way is to be on low row at t=6, like y=4, then move up.\n\nBut that takes at least 5 more actions to go from y=4 to y=9, starting from t=6.\n\nAt t=6 y=4, then t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9. That's 5 actions from t=6 to t=10, plus actions before.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=6, I have two actions.\n\nIf I do nothing, t=4 S, t=5 S, then t=6 y=4.\n\nThen actions t=6 to t=10: U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nTotal actions: t=4 S, t=5 S, t=6 U, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U. 7 actions.\n\nAt t=4, I could move up to y=5 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=5, I must move down to y=4 at t=6, so a5=D.\n\nThen at t=6 y=4.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo y sequence: t=4:4, t=5:5 (after U), t=6:4 (after D), t=7:5 (U), t=8:6 (U), t=9:7 (U), t=10:8 (U), t=11:9 (U).\n\nStill 7 actions to reach at t=11.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=6, which is safe, since y=6 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, no problem with y=2,3,4 at t=8,9 because I am not on them.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, y=6, not low row.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=6, after moving down, I am at y=4 t=6.\n\nThen I do U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, y=5, I can do U to y=6 at t=8, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need 5 steps from y=4.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to be at y=9, the net delta is +5, so minimum 5 actions if no delay, but with delay, more.\n\nBut in this case, I have to spend two actions to avoid the collision, either staying or moving down and up.\n\nBut in the move down case, I went to y=5 and back to y=4, so net zero progress, wasted one action.\n\nSimilarly, staying twice, no progress.\n\nSo both take 7 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is always safe, I could go down to y=0, but y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision, but it doesn't help to go down.\n\nFor example, at t=4, D to y=3, then at t=5 y=3, etc, but then I have to come up, takes more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is 7 actions? But let's see if I can do in 6.\n\nSuppose I can be on y=5 at t=5, then at t=5, instead of moving down, I stay or something, but I can't stay because at t=6 y=5 unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=8 at t=6, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps at t=6, I can be on y=7 if I moved faster, but from t=4 y=4, to t=6 y=7, impossible, max y6=6.\n\ny6=6 but unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by being on higher rows at some points.\n\nFor example, at t=4, U to y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=5, I can U to y=6, but at t=6 y=6 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr at t=5, D to y=4, but then same as before.\n\nSo I think 7 is the minimum with this approach.\n\nBut let's check if I can avoid the delay by timing differently.\n\nSuppose I move up at t=4 to y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=5, I must leave, so I do U or D.\n\nU to y=6 at t=6, bad.\n\nD to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6 y=4.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut instead of going directly, I can go faster if I can skip some, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps at t=6 y=4, I do U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7 y=5, U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8 y=6, U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9 y=7, U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nU to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=6, which is safe, but y=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=8,9, but I am not on them, so ok.\n\nCan I reach y=9 at t=10?\n\nFor that, y10=9.\n\ny10=9 means at turn t=10, position y=9.\n\nTo have y10=9, from y6=4 at t=6, I need to increase by 5 in 4 actions: from t=6 to t=9 actions a6 to a9 determine y7 to y10.\n\ny7 = y6 + Δa6\n\ny8 = y7 + Δa7\n\ny9 = y8 + Δa8\n\ny10 = y9 + Δa9\n\nI need y10=9.\n\ny6=4.\n\nSo y10 = y6 + Δa6 + Δa7 + Δa8 + Δa9\n\nEach Δa is -1,0,1.\n\nSo to increase by 5, I need sum of Δa = +5 in 4 actions, so possible only if all U, but all U would be y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, then y10=8, not 9.\n\ny10=8, need another U to y11=9.\n\nWith 4 actions, from y6=4, max y10=8, since +4.\n\nThen y11=9 with fifth action.\n\nSo from t=6 y=4, earliest to reach y=9 is at t=11 with 5 actions.\n\nSimilarly, from start, with the two actions to get to t=6 y=4, total 7 actions.\n\nIf I start by going up to y=5 at t=5, then down to y=4 at t=6, same thing.\n\nSo seems 7 is minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst plan: all actions from t=4.\n\nTurn t=4: S, so y5=4\n\nTurn t=5: S, so y6=4\n\nTurn t=6: U, so y7=5\n\nTurn t=7: U, so y8=6\n\nTurn t=8: U, so y9=7\n\nTurn t=9: U, so y10=8\n\nTurn t=10: U, so y11=9\n\nReached at t=11.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4 at t=4: car span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4 at t=5: T=5, span for car [-35+6(1), -24+6(1)] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe. (since y=4 car has s=6)\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4 at t=6: T=6, span [-35+6*2, -24+6*2] = [-35+12,-24+12]= [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5 at t=7: T=7, first car [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36,-24+36]= [1,12], 0 not in; second [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6 at t=8: first car [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48,-24+48]= [13,24], 0 not in; second [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7 at t=9: first car [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60,-24+60]= [25,36], safe; second [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8 at t=10: first car [-11+12*6, 12*6] = [-11+72,72]= [61,72], safe; second [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], safe.\n\nt=11: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with 6 actions?\n\nSuppose I do only one delay.\n\nFor example, at t=4, U to y5=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=5, I cannot stay, so I must do D to y6=4 (since U to y6=6 unsafe).\n\nThen at t=6 y=4.\n\nNow, from here, I have to reach y=9 in 4 actions? But as before, with 4 actions, from y=4, max y=8 at t=10, then need fifth action to y=9 at t=11.\n\nActions: t=4 U, t=5 D, t=6 U, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U.\n\ny: t=4:4, t=5:5 (after U), t=6:4 (after D), t=7:5 (U), t=8:6 (U), t=9:7 (U), t=10:8 (U), t=11:9 (U)\n\nStill 7 actions.\n\nIf at t=6 y=4, I do U to y7=5, U to y8=6, U to y9=7, U to y10=8, U to y11=9, same.\n\nNo, with actions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut from t=4 to t=6, I used two actions to go up and down, net zero.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nPerhaps start by going down, but worse.\n\nOr, another idea: at t=4, I go up to y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of down, I go up to y=6, but at t=6 collision, not possible.\n\nUnless the car is not there, but it is.\n\nSo I think 7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can be on y=8 at t=7 or something.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=4, if I U at t=4 to y5=5.\n\nThen at t=5, U to y6=6, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the sequence with 7 actions is the way to go.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=4.\n\nSo actions at turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nIn the first sequence: t=4: S, t=5: S, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nBut at t=9: U to y10=8? Let's list y at each turn.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then y_{t+1}\n\nBetter to list the actions per turn.\n\nTurn t=4: action a4, determines y5\n\nTurn t=5: action a5, determines y6\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: S → y5 =4\n\nTurn 5: S → y6 =4\n\nTurn 6: U → y7 =5\n\nTurn 7: U → y8 =6\n\nTurn 8: U → y9 =7\n\nTurn 9: U → y10=8\n\nTurn 10: U → y11=9\n\nReached at turn 11.\n\nWith the down-up: turn4: U → y5=5\n\nTurn5: D → y6=4\n\nThen same as above from turn6.\n\nBut in this case, at turn5, I did D, which is down, but it works, but takes same number of turns.\n\nI think S,S is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be minimal H, but H is the number of turns, I think the number of actions.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, I think meaning the number of actions in the sequence.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nSo for t_1=4, actions a4 to a_{4+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y should be 9.\n\nStart at turn t_1=4, y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=4 to t=4+H-1, then y_{t_1 + H} = y_{4+H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=7, actions at t=4 to t=10 (t=4+6? t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen after last action, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn my case, actions: a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10 (H=7, t from 0 to 6, a_{4+0} to a_{4+6})\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H = 4+7=11, y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=6, is it possible?\n\nSuppose actions a4 to a9 (t=0 to 5, H=6), then at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nBut y10=9.\n\nFrom start y4=4, to y10=9, need +5 in 6 actions? From turn 4 to turn 10, there are 6 actions: a4 to a9 determine y5 to y10.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum_{t=4 to 9} Δa_t\n\nSince each action changes y for the next turn.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δa4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δa5 = y4 + Δa4 + Δa5\n\n...\n\ny10 = y4 + Δa4 + Δa5 + Δa6 + Δa7 + Δa8 + Δa9\n\ny4=4, y10=9, so sum_{k=4}^9 Δa_k = 5\n\nEach Δa_k in {-1,0,1}, so to sum to 5, with 6 terms, possible, e.g., five +1 and one 0, or six +1 but max +6, but y max 9, but from 4, max y10=10, but we need exactly 9.\n\nBut with the constraint to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example, if I do U,U,U,U,U,S or something.\n\nBut I need to avoid the unsafe points.\n\nSuppose at t=4, U to y5=5\n\nThen at t=5, I need to not be on y=5 at t=6, so I must do D or S, but S keeps y=5 at t=6, unsafe, so must do D to y6=4\n\nThen at t=6, y=4\n\nNow from t=6, I need to reach y10=9.\n\ny6=4, y10=9, need +5 in 4 actions: a6 to a9 determine y7 to y10.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δa6 + Δa7 + Δa8 + Δa9\n\nSet to 9, so Δa6 + Δa7 + Δa8 + Δa9 =5\n\nBut each <=1, so only possible if all U, but all U: y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, then y10=8, not 9.\n\nIf I do U,U,U,U, y10=8.\n\nThen I need another action to reach y=9.\n\nWith four actions from y6=4, max y10=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 with four actions from y=4.\n\nMinimum five actions from y=4 to y=9: y to y+5 in 5 steps.\n\nThus from t=6 y=4, need actions at t=6,7,8,9,10 to have y11=9.\n\nSimilarly, in all cases, with the necessary delay, H=7 seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different row at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, D to y5=3\n\nThen at t=5, S or U, etc., but likely worse.\n\nI think it's not possible in less than 7.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 4, action S; turn 5, action S; turn 6, action U; and so on.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t=4, span [-11,0], which includes 0, but since I am not on y=8, ok.\n\nIn my path, I don't go to low rows at t=8,9, so no issue.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nTo make it faster, but I don't see how.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is never on a freeway row where a car occupies position \\(x=0\\) at the same turn.\n\n### Analysis and Path:\n- The direct path moving up every turn (actions U, U, U, U, U) would take 5 turns but results in a collision at turn 6 on freeway \\(y=6\\) because a car spans \\([-11, 0]\\) at that turn, including \\(x=0\\).\n- To avoid collisions, the player must delay the ascent by staying at \\(y=4\\) for two turns (turns 4 and 5) to avoid being on rows \\(y=5\\), \\(y=6\\), or \\(y=7\\) at turn 6, as these rows are unsafe at that specific turn due to cars occupying \\(x=0\\).\n- After turn 6, rows \\(y=5\\) to \\(y=8\\) are safe, allowing the player to move up consecutively to reach \\(y=9\\).\n\n### Safe Sequence:\n- **Turn 4 (current turn)**: Action \\(S\\) (stay). Player remains at \\(y=4\\). Freeway \\(y=4\\) is safe at turn 4 (car span \\([-35, -24]\\), \\(0\\) not in span).\n- **Turn 5**: Action \\(S\\) (stay). Player remains at \\(y=4\\). Freeway \\(y=4\\) is safe at turn 5 (car span \\([-29, -18]\\), \\(0\\) not in span).\n- **Turn 6**: Action \\(U\\) (up). Player moves to \\(y=5\\) at turn 7. Freeway \\(y=4\\) is safe at turn 6 (car span \\([-23, -12]\\), \\(0\\) not in span).\n- **Turn 7**: Action \\(U\\) (up). Player moves to \\(y=6\\) at turn 8. Freeway \\(y=5\\) is safe at turn 7 (car spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([73, 84]\\), \\(0\\) not in either span).\n- **Turn 8**: Action \\(U\\) (up). Player moves to \\(y=7\\) at turn 9. Freeway \\(y=6\\) is safe at turn 8 (car spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([85, 96]\\), \\(0\\) not in either span).\n- **Turn 9**: Action \\(U\\) (up). Player moves to \\(y=8\\) at turn 10. Freeway \\(y=7\\) is safe at turn 9 (car spans \\([25, 36]\\) and \\([97, 108]\\), \\(0\\) not in either span).\n- **Turn 10**: Action \\(U\\) (up). Player moves to \\(y=9\\) at turn 11. Freeway \\(y=8\\) is safe at turn 10 (car spans \\([61, 72]\\) and \\([109, 120]\\), \\(0\\) not in either span).\n\nAt turn 11 (\\(t_1 + H = 4 + 7 = 11\\)), the player reaches \\(y=9\\), which has no cars, so no collision is possible.\n\n### Why \\(H=7\\) is Minimal:\n- The net change in \\(y\\) from 4 to 9 requires a +5 change, which minimally takes 5 actions if no delays. However, the collision at turn 6 on \\(y=6\\) forces a delay.\n- Avoiding this collision requires not being on rows \\(y=5\\), \\(y=6\\), or \\(y=7\\) at turn 6. Starting from \\(y=4\\) at turn 4, the only safe options at turn 6 are \\(y \\leq 4\\) or \\(y=8\\) (but \\(y=8\\) is unreachable by turn 6 with max +2 change).\n- Thus, staying at \\(y=4\\) for turns 4 and 5 (or equivalent) is necessary, adding 2 turns of no progress. The remaining ascent takes 5 actions, totaling 7 actions. No sequence with \\(H<7\\) avoids collisions and reaches \\(y=9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: \\ S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\ S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\ U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 6, and I have the positions and movements of the cars on each freeway.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given the head and tail at turn t_1=6, direction, and speed. The span is given, and it moves left or right based on direction.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 (the x-position where the player crosses) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and after action, they move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, they are on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe collision check is at turn T: if y_T is the freeway, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the car spans change over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at t_1=6.\n\nFreeway 1: car at (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -45, tail is -56? That seems backward. Let me read the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h]? No, let's see:\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then at T, [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (-45, -56, right, 3). I think the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nBut for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head h = -45, tail τ = -56, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction is right, the span is from τ to h, so from tail to head, meaning left to right? No.\n\nIf tail is τ and head is h, and direction right, then the car is moving right, so at t_1, the left end is τ, right end is h, so span is [τ, h] = [-56, -45].\n\nThen at time T, since moving right, span becomes [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)] = [-56 + 3(T-6), -45 + 3(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor collision, we care when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all seem right-moving except possibly, but all given are right-moving I think.\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: head -45, tail -56, right, speed 3 → span at t: [-56 + 3(t-6), -45 + 3(t-6)]\n\nFreeway 2: head -12, tail -23, right, speed 6 → span at t: [-23 + 6(t-6), -12 + 6(t-6)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? head -12, tail -23, right, speed 6 → same as freeway 2? But different freeway, so separate cars, but same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: also head -12, tail -23, right, speed 6 → again same.\n\nSo multiple freeways have cars with same position and movement.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12 → span at t: [-11 + 12(t-6), 0 + 12(t-6)]\n\nSecond car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 12 → span at t: [-59 + 12(t-6), -48 + 12(t-6)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12) → identical to freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 8: (24, 13, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head 24, tail 13? But tail should be left, head right? 13 to 24, since right, so tail 13, head 24.\n\nSpan at t: [13 + 12(t-6), 24 + 12(t-6)]\n\nSecond car: same as others, head -48, tail -59, right, speed 12 → span [-59 +12(t-6), -48 +12(t-6)]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn t=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is above, so probably need to move up.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is at x=0, y=9, and since y=9 has no freeway or no cars, it's safe.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,y) for y=0 to 9, but collision only when on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=9, we need to move up 5 steps, but we can also move down or stay, but since we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nThe cars move, so we need to find a path and timing where when we are on a freeway y at turn t, 0 is not in the car span for that y at that t.\n\nSince we start at turn 6, position y=4.\n\nWe need to choose actions for each turn starting from turn 6.\n\nLet me denote the time from t=6 onwards.\n\nSet τ = t - 6, so at τ=0, turn 6, y=4.\n\nThen at each step, we choose action, y changes accordingly.\n\nWe need to find H and actions such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, and after H actions, we have moved H steps in time, so at time τ, we have taken τ actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t_1=6, so turns from 6 to 6+H-1.\n\nAfter H turns, we have from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1, so the position at turn 6+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nFor example, at turn 6 (t=0), we are at y=4.\n\nAfter action a_6, at turn 7 (t=1), we are at y_7, and so on, up to turn 6+H-1, where y_{6+H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=6 to t=6+H-2? Let's clarify.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{6+0}, a_{6+1}, ..., a_{6+H-1}.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is updated H times, so from turn 6 to turn 6+H, but at turn 6, we are at initial position, then after a_6, at turn 7, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6, and so on, after a_{6+H-1}, at turn 6+H, y_{6+H} = y_{6+H-1} + Δy_{6+H-1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is y_{6 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn T, which sets y_{T+1}, but we care about y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, before action a_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, we care about y_t at that turn.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check if 0 in span of cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe actions affect the next position.\n\nTo have y_{6+H-1} =9, we need to reach y=9 at turn 6+H-1.\n\nSince we start at turn 6, y=4, we need to increase y by 5, so minimum H-1 =5 if we move up each time, but H is the number of turns, from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1, that's H turns, but positions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1.\n\nAt turn 6: y=4\n\nTurn 7: after a_6\n\n...\n\nTurn 6+H-1: y=9\n\nSo from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1, there are (6+H-1) - 6 +1 = H turns, but we have H actions: from a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, which affect the positions from turn 7 to turn 6+H.\n\nBut at turn 6+H-1, we are at y=9, which is after H-1 actions? Let's count.\n\nAt time τ=0 (turn 6), position y=4.\n\nAfter first action a_6 (at τ=0), position at τ=1 (turn 7) is y=4 + Δy_6.\n\nAfter second action a_7 at τ=1, position at τ=2 (turn 8) is y= y_7 + Δy_7, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, position at τ=k (turn 6+k).\n\nWe want at some τ, y=9, and that τ should be 6+H-1 -6 = H-1? Turn at time τ from start is turn 6+τ.\n\nPosition at turn 6+τ is y_{6+τ}.\n\nWe want y_{6+τ} =9 for some τ, and we want min H such that for τ=H-1, y_{6+H-1} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turn 6 to 6+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have positions from turn 7 to turn 6+H.\n\nBut at turn 6+H-1, we are at y_{6+H-1}, and we set it to 9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at turn 6, y=4, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 7, y could be 3,4,5.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=4, we need at least 5 up moves, so min H-1 >=5, so H >=6, since at τ=5, turn 11, y could be 9 if all up.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the car span, meaning it's dangerous to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway k, at turn t, the span of cars, and 0 in span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but for collision, if any car has 0 in span, it's bad.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, we need to check all.\n\nBut in this case, freeways 1,2,3,4 have one car each, 5,6,7 have two, 8 has two.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied, i.e., collision possible.\n\nSet t as absolute turn, t >=6.\n\nOr use τ = t -6, so τ >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: span at t: [-56 + 3(τ), -45 + 3(τ)] since τ=t-6.\n\n0 in span if -56 +3τ <= 0 <= -45 +3τ\n\nWhich is -56 +3τ <=0 and 0 <= -45 +3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -56 +3τ <=0 => 3τ <=56 => τ <= 56/3 ≈18.666, so τ <=18\n\nSecond: 0 <= -45 +3τ => 3τ >=45 => τ >=15\n\nSo for τ from 15 to 18 inclusive, 0 in span for freeway 1.\n\nτ=15,16,17,18.\n\nAt τ=15, t=21, span: -56+45= -11? τ=15, -56 +3*15 = -56+45= -11, -45+45=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nτ=16: -56+48= -8, -45+48=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nτ=17: -56+51= -5, -45+51=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=18: -56+54= -2, -45+54=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nτ=19: -56+57=1, -45+57=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=14: -56+42= -14, -45+42= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at τ=15,16,17,18 (t=21,22,23,24)\n\nNow freeway 2: span [-23 +6τ, -12 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -23+6τ <=0 <= -12+6τ\n\nFirst: -23+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=23 => τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so τ <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+6τ => 6τ >=12 => τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2,3\n\nτ=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=1: -23+6= -17, -12+6= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nτ=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo dangerous τ=2,3 (t=8,9)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters, so dangerous at τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 4: same, dangerous τ=2,3\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12) but head 0, tail -11, so span at τ: [-11 +12τ, 0 +12τ]\n\n0 in span if -11+12τ <=0 <= 0+12τ\n\nFirst: -11+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so τ <=0 since τ integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12τ => τ >=0\n\nBut τ <=0 and τ >=0, so τ=0\n\nAt τ=0, t=6, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nNow second car on freeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12) head -48, tail -59, span [-59 +12τ, -48 +12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59+12τ <=0 <= -48+12τ\n\nFirst: -59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <= 59/12 ≈4.916, τ <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12τ => 12τ >=48 => τ >=4\n\nSo τ=4\n\nτ=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car dangerous at τ=0, second car dangerous at τ=4.\n\nThus, freeway 5 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24, 13, right, 12) head 24, tail 13? Tail 13, head 24, since right, span [13 +12τ, 24 +12τ]\n\n0 in span? 13+12τ <=0 <=24+12τ? But 13+12τ >=13 >0 for τ>=0, so left end always positive, so 0 never in span, since min is 13 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nAs τ increases, it moves right, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (-48, -59, right, 12) same as before, span [-59+12τ, -48+12τ], dangerous at τ=4, as above.\n\nSo for freeway 8, first car never dangerous, second car dangerous at τ=4.\n\nThus freeway 8 dangerous only at τ=4.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: τ=15,16,17,18\n\nFreeway 2: τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 3: τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 4: τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 5: τ=0,4\n\nFreeway 6: τ=0,4\n\nFreeway 7: τ=0,4\n\nFreeway 8: τ=4\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 5,6,7 are dangerous because of first car.\n\nBut we are on y=4 at τ=0.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4? Freeways y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 6, position y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 dangerous at τ=0?\n\nFrom above, freeway 4 dangerous at τ=2,3, not at τ=0.\n\nτ=2,3, not 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 is y=5, etc.\n\nLet's list by y.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nSo at turn t, if player on y, and y between 1 and 8, then if y is dangerous at that t.\n\nDangerous times for each y:\n\ny=1: freeway 1, dangerous at τ=15,16,17,18\n\ny=2: freeway 2, dangerous at τ=2,3\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at τ=2,3\n\ny=4: freeway 4, dangerous at τ=2,3\n\ny=5: freeway 5, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=6: freeway 6, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=7: freeway 7, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=8: freeway 8, dangerous only at τ=4 (since first car not dangerous)\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are at y=4.\n\ny=4 at τ=0: is it dangerous? y=4 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=0, so safe at τ=0.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are dangerous at τ=0.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, τ=0, safe.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or stay, but since we want min time, we should go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous τ.\n\nFor example, if we move up immediately to y=5 at next turn.\n\nActions: at turn 6 (τ=0), we choose action.\n\nAfter action, position changes at next turn.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 6, position y=4.\n\nWe choose a_6: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U, then at turn 7 (τ=1), we are at y=5.\n\nIf we choose S, at turn 7, y=4.\n\nIf D, y=3, but we want to go up, so probably not down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, at τ=1, turn 7.\n\nWhat are dangerous positions at τ=1.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: dangerous at τ=15-18, not 1\n\ny=2: dangerous τ=2,3, not 1\n\ny=3: τ=2,3, not 1\n\ny=4: τ=2,3, not 1\n\ny=5: dangerous at τ=0,4. τ=1 not dangerous\n\ny=6: τ=0,4, τ=1 not\n\ny=7: τ=0,4, τ=1 not\n\ny=8: dangerous only at τ=4, not τ=1\n\nSo at τ=1, all y are safe, no danger.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, need to check.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nSince min steps to increase y by 5, H-1=5, so if we go up every turn, we can reach in 5 moves.\n\nStart τ=0, y=4\n\nAfter a_6 U, τ=1, y=5\n\na_7 U, τ=2, y=6\n\na_8 U, τ=3, y=7\n\na_9 U, τ=4, y=8\n\na_10 U, τ=5, y=9\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, which is turn 6+5=11, and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for each step if collision occurs.\n\nAt each turn, the position and time.\n\nAt turn 6 (τ=0): y=4, freeway 4. Dangerous? τ=0, y=4 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=0, so safe.\n\nAt turn 7 (τ=1): y=5, freeway 5. Dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4. τ=1 not dangerous, so safe.\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=2): y=6, freeway 6. Dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4. τ=2 not dangerous? τ=2, for y=6, dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4, not τ=2, so safe? But let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4. τ=2 is neither, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9 (τ=3): y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4. τ=3 not, so safe.\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=4): y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at τ=4? y=8 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=4, turn 10, we are at y=8.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, and at τ=4, it is dangerous because of the second car.\n\nSo collision would occur if we are on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=8 at turn 10.\n\nSo the direct up path has collision at τ=4 when on y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or something.\n\nSince at τ=4, y=8 is dangerous, but other y might be safe or not.\n\nAt τ=4, which y are dangerous?\n\ny=5: dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=6: dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=7: dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=8: dangerous at τ=4\n\ny=1,2,3,4 not dangerous at τ=4.\n\nBut we are going up, so we might not want to go down.\n\ny=4 at τ=4: is it dangerous? y=4 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3, etc.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or move down to avoid being on y=5-8 at τ=4.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nFirst, let's see the dangerous periods.\n\nMain dangerous times: at τ=0, y=5,6,7 dangerous\n\nBut we start at y=4, safe at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5,6,7,8 all dangerous.\n\ny=5,6,7 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4, y=8 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nAlso, at τ=2 and 3, y=2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nBut since we start at y=4, and move up, we might not be affected by y=2,3.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=4 τ=0 safe, y=5 τ=1 safe, y=6 τ=2: now τ=2, y=6 not dangerous, as above.\n\ny=6 dangerous only τ=0 and τ=4, not τ=2.\n\nSimilarly y=7 τ=3 not dangerous.\n\nOnly problem at y=8 τ=4.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Be on y=8 at a different time, not τ=4.\n\n- Or skip y=8, but we have to go through it to reach y=9, since y=8 must be visited or can we jump from y=7 to y=9? No, each move changes y by at most 1, so we must be on y=8 at some point.\n\ny=8 must be visited.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 when it is not dangerous.\n\ny=8 dangerous only at τ=4, so at other times, it is safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=8: is it safe? At τ=3, freeway 8.\n\ny=8 dangerous only at τ=4, so at τ=3, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, we reach y=8 at τ=4 if we go straight up.\n\nIf we can reach y=8 earlier or later.\n\nCurrently, going straight, we are at y=7 at τ=3, then move to y=8 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo if we can be at y=8 before or after τ=4.\n\nFor example, if we go faster to y=8.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe can only move to y=5 at τ=1, then y=6 at τ=2, y=7 at τ=3, y=8 at τ=4. Cannot be faster, since we move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we start from y=4, but to reach y=8, min 4 moves: from y=4 to y=5,6,7,8 in 4 steps, so earliest at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, later, at τ=5, we can be at y=8 if we delay.\n\nFor example, if at some point we stay or move down.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we prefer not to delay.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at τ=3? But how?\n\nAt τ=0, y=4\n\nAfter one move, τ=1, y<=5\n\nAfter two moves, τ=2, y<=6\n\nAfter three moves, τ=3, y<=7\n\nAfter four moves, τ=4, y<=8\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=8 after τ=4, for example at τ=5.\n\nBut then to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at y=8 τ=4, we must not be on y=8 at that time.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are at y=7 at τ=3, if we don't move up to y=8 at τ=4, but stay or move down.\n\nBut moving down might not help.\n\nThen we can move up later.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nWe need to go through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nEach of these has dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, y=5,6,7 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=4\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nFor example, y=5 safe at τ=1,2,3,5,...\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn particular, at τ=1, all safe, as we saw.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2,3,4 dangerous, but y=5,6,7,8 safe? y=5 at τ=2: dangerous? y=5 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4, not τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at τ=2 safe, etc.\n\ny=8 at τ=2 safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5,6,7,8 all safe, except y=2,3,4 dangerous but we might not be there.\n\nNow, for y=8, safe at τ=3, for example.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=8 at τ=3, as above.\n\nEarliest at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=8 dangerous, so we cannot be there.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=8 at some τ >4 or <4, but <4 impossible, so only after τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7, we can be there at safe times.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible except when forced to avoid.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need to not be on y=8.\n\nAlso, not on y=5,6,7 if possible, but we might be on lower y.\n\nSince we are moving up, at τ=4, we could be on y=7 or y=8 or lower if we delayed.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=4\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nSuppose we go up at first few steps.\n\nOption: at τ=0, action U, then τ=1, y=5\n\nNow at τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nThen action U, τ=2, y=6\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, safe (since dangerous only τ=0,4)\n\nThen action U, τ=3, y=7\n\nAt τ=3, y=7, safe (dangerous τ=0,4)\n\nNow, at τ=3, we are at y=7.\n\nNext action at turn corresponding to τ=3, which is turn 9, action a_9.\n\nIf we go up, to y=8 at τ=4, but τ=4, y=8 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up.\n\nWe can choose S, then at τ=4, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 at τ=4 is dangerous, because y=7 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=6 at τ=4, y=6 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nOr if we stay, y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo at τ=4, if we are on y=5,6,7,8, all dangerous.\n\ny=5,6,7 dangerous at τ=4, y=8 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nOnly y=0,1,2,3,4,9 are safe at τ=4.\n\ny=4 at τ=4: is it dangerous? y=4 dangerous at τ=2 and 3, not τ=4, so safe.\n\ny=3 at τ=4: dangerous? y=3 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,1 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at τ=3, so if we move down, to y=6 at τ=4, but y=6 dangerous.\n\nOr stay, y=7 dangerous.\n\nOr move up, y=8 dangerous.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at τ=3 if we want to avoid τ=4 danger, because from y=7, whatever we do, at τ=4 we are on y=6,7, or 8, all dangerous at τ=4.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at τ=3, then at τ=4, if we go to y=7, dangerous; stay y=6 dangerous; down to y=5 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=5 at τ=3, same issue.\n\nTherefore, to avoid being on y=5-8 at τ=4, we must be at y<=4 or y=9 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=9 at τ=4 might be too early, since we start from y=4.\n\nAt τ=4, to be at y=9, we need to have moved up 5 times in 4 steps? From τ=0 to τ=4, we have 4 actions, so y can increase by at most 4, from 4 to 8, not to 9.\n\nMax y at τ=4 is 8.\n\nMin is 0.\n\nSo at τ=4, y must be between 0 and 8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, to be safe at τ=4, we must be on y<=4, since y=0,1,2,3,4 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=4 safe, y=3 safe, etc.\n\nNow, we are at τ=3, y=7 in the current path, which is not <=4.\n\nSo we need to be at lower y at τ=3 or something.\n\nPerhaps we should not go up so fast.\n\nFor example, start at τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, we could stay or move down to avoid being high at τ=4.\n\nBut moving down might not help and takes more time.\n\nSince τ=4 is dangerous for mid freeways, we can be on low y at that time.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut let's see the critical points.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous τ are only at τ=0,2,3,4,15-18, but τ=15-18 are late, we can reach early.\n\nτ=0 we are safe at y=4.\n\nτ=2 and 3, y=2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nBut we start at y=4, which at τ=0 safe, but if we stay, at τ=1, y=4, safe (since y=4 dangerous only τ=2,3), at τ=1 y=4 safe.\n\nAt τ=2, if on y=4, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo minimize time, let's try to go up but avoid being on dangerous spots.\n\nSince we must not be on y=5-8 at τ=4, we should be at y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen after τ=4, we can go up quickly.\n\nNow, at τ=4, we need to be at some y<=4.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe have 4 actions to reach τ=4.\n\nWe need to end at y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nSince we start at y=4, we can stay or move down or up but not too high.\n\nBut we want to be as high as possible to later reach y=9 faster.\n\nBut at τ=4, we must be y<=4.\n\nSo if we stay at y=4, or move down.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 6), we are at y=4, choose action.\n\nIf we choose S, then at τ=1, y=4\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, safe.\n\nThen choose action at τ=1.\n\nIf we choose S again, at τ=2, y=4.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=4 is dangerous! Because y=4 dangerous at τ=2 and 3.\n\nSo at τ=2, if on y=4, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, cannot be on y=4.\n\nAlso, cannot be on y=2 or y=3 at τ=2 or 3.\n\nSo at τ=2 and 3, we must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2 and 3, we should be on y=1,5,6,7,8,9 or 0.\n\nBut y=1 at τ=2: dangerous? y=1 dangerous at τ=15-18, not τ=2, so safe.\n\ny=5 at τ=2: safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at τ=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly for τ=3.\n\nBut we also have to avoid τ=4 for y=5-8.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to be at y<=4 at τ=4, and not on y=2,3,4 at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nAt τ=4, y<=4, safe.\n\nBut at τ=2 and τ=3, we cannot be on y=2,3,4.\n\nSince y<=4 at τ=4, and at τ=2 and 3 we cannot be on y=2,3,4, so we must be on y=0,1,5,6,7,8 at τ=2 and τ=3.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 at τ=3: but at τ=3, y=5,6,7,8 are all safe, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=8 at τ=3 safe.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=8 at τ=3, as before.\n\nLet's think of a sequence.\n\nStart τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nAction at τ=0: we need to move to avoid being on y=4 at τ=2.\n\nSo we must move up or down.\n\nIf we move down to y=3, then at τ=1, y=3.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=1: is it dangerous? y=3 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=1, so safe.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, we choose action.\n\nIf we go down to y=2 at τ=2, but y=2 at τ=2 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at τ=2, dangerous.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at τ=2, dangerous.\n\nAll bad.\n\nIf at τ=0, we go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, safe (since dangerous only τ=0,4, τ=1 safe).\n\nThen at τ=1, we choose action.\n\nNow, at τ=1, y=5.\n\nWe need to be at τ=2 not on y=2,3,4, so we can be on y=5,6,7,etc.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at τ=2, then y=6 at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=6.\n\nAction: we need to be at τ=3 not on y=2,3,4, so can be on y=6 or other.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at τ=3, then y=7 at τ=3, safe.\n\nNow at τ=3, y=7.\n\nThen at τ=3, action: we need to be at τ=4 not on y=5-8, so must be y<=4.\n\nBut from y=7, if we go down to y=6 at τ=4, but y=6 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, to y=7 or y=8, dangerous.\n\nDown to y=6, dangerous.\n\nOr down twice? But we have only one action.\n\nAt τ=3, we choose action for turn at τ=3, which affects position at τ=4.\n\nFrom y=7, if we choose D, to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=4 dangerous.\n\nS to y=7 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nAll lead to danger at τ=4.\n\nSo not good.\n\nFrom earlier, at τ=2, y=6.\n\nInstead of going up to y=7 at τ=3, we could go down or stay.\n\nIf at τ=2, y=6, we choose D, to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5.\n\nBut y=5 at τ=3 is safe, since dangerous only τ=0,4.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5.\n\nAction: if we go down to y=4 at τ=4, then y=4 at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, y=5 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nIf up, y=6 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nSo we can go down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we are at y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen we can start going up to y=9.\n\nFrom τ=4 onwards.\n\nτ=4, y=4.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, is it dangerous? y=5 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=4, not τ=5, so safe.\n\nThen U, to y=6 at τ=6.\n\ny=6 at τ=6, dangerous? τ=6 not 0 or 4, safe.\n\nU, to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nSafe.\n\nU, to y=8 at τ=8.\n\ny=8 at τ=8, dangerous? Only dangerous at τ=4, τ=8 safe.\n\nThen U, to y=9 at τ=9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut we started at τ=0, and now τ=9, so H-1=9? Turn at τ=9 is turn 15, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=9, we have actions at τ=0 to τ=8? Let's list the turns.\n\nAt turn 6 (τ=0), y=4\n\nActions:\n\na_6: U (to y=5 at turn 7)\n\nIn the sequence I described:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 6), action U, so to y=5 at τ=1 (turn 7)\n\nThen at τ=1 (turn 7), action U, to y=6 at τ=2 (turn 8)\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 8), action U, to y=7 at τ=3? No.\n\nEarlier I had a different sequence for the first part.\n\nIn the avoidance sequence:\n\nFirst part:\n\nτ=0 (turn 6), y=4, action U, so to y=5 at turn 7 (τ=1)\n\nτ=1 (turn 7), y=5, action U, to y=6 at turn 8 (τ=2)\n\nτ=2 (turn 8), y=6, now instead of going up, I said go down? No.\n\nIn my earlier text, I said at τ=2, y=6, we choose D to go to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nBut let's write actions.\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=2), we are at y=6, choose action.\n\nIf choose D, then at turn 9 (τ=3), y=5? Action at turn t affects position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=2), position y=6.\n\nChoose action a_8.\n\nIf a_8 = D, then at turn 9 (τ=3), y=5.\n\nThen at turn 9 (τ=3), position y=5, choose action a_9.\n\nIf a_9 = D, then at turn 10 (τ=4), y=4.\n\nThen at turn 10 (τ=4), y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=4), y=4, choose a_10 = U, to y=5 at turn 11 (τ=5)\n\nAt turn 11 (τ=5), y=5, choose a_11 = U, to y=6 at turn 12 (τ=6)\n\nAt turn 12 (τ=6), y=6, choose a_12 = U, to y=7 at turn 13 (τ=7)\n\nAt turn 13 (τ=7), y=7, choose a_13 = U, to y=8 at turn 14 (τ=8)\n\nAt turn 14 (τ=8), y=8, choose a_14 = U, to y=9 at turn 15 (τ=9)\n\nAt turn 15 (τ=9), y=9, done.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at turn 15, which is τ=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn 15.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1 =15, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used some down moves, took more turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be smarter.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=4, we need to be y<=4, but at τ=2 and 3, we need to not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=2, we were at y=6, which is not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, which is safe for τ=4.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut we used one down move, so took longer.\n\nCan we avoid down move?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go up to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of going up, we could stay or something.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nIf we choose S, stay, then at τ=2, y=5.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, which is safe, since not dangerous.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=5, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at τ=3, then at τ=3, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=6, action: we need to be at τ=4 y<=4, but y=6, if we go down to y=5 at τ=4, but y=5 dangerous at τ=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at τ=2, y=5, we go down to y=4 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=4 dangerous! Because y=4 dangerous at τ=3.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf at τ=2, y=5, we go down to y=4 at τ=3, but τ=3, y=4 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at τ=3, as before, then at τ=3, y=6, then to go to y<=4 at τ=4, we need to go down twice, impossible with one action.\n\nSo we must go down at some point to reach low y.\n\nPerhaps start by not going up immediately.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=4, instead of U, choose S or D.\n\nIf S, at τ=1, y=4.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=4, safe (τ=1 not dangerous for y=4).\n\nBut at τ=1, if we choose U, to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf at τ=1, we choose D, to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=3 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at τ=0, choose D, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3, safe (τ=1 not dangerous for y=3).\n\nThen at τ=1, choose action.\n\nIf we choose U, to y=4 at τ=2, but y=4 at τ=2 dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf choose S, y=3 at τ=2, dangerous.\n\nIf choose D, to y=2 at τ=2, dangerous.\n\nAll bad because at τ=2, y=2,3,4 all dangerous.\n\nSo the only way to avoid τ=2 danger is to not be on y=2,3,4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for τ=3.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2 and τ=3, we must be on y=1 or y=5 or higher, but y=1 might be possible.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, dangerous only at τ=15-18, so at τ=2,3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 safe at τ=2,3.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=3 safe, but we can't reach early.\n\nNow, to be at y<=4 at τ=4.\n\nOne option is to be at y=1 at τ=4, but that might take more down moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSince we need to be high at τ=2 and τ=3 to avoid danger, and low at τ=4.\n\nBut from high to low in one step.\n\nIn the first sequence I had, we went up to y=6 at τ=2, then down to y=5 at τ=3, then down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, which is not 2,3,4, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=4 safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut we used two down moves? In actions: from y=6 to y=5 is down, y=5 to y=4 is down, so two down moves.\n\nIn the sequence: at τ=2, y=6, action D, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5, action D, to y=4 at τ=4\n\nYes, two down moves.\n\nBut we could go from y=6 to y=5 to y=4, but at τ=3, if we go directly from y=6 to y=4? No, each move changes by 1.\n\nSo min change is one per turn.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 at τ=2 and stay or something.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=5, then at τ=3, if we stay, y=5, safe, but then at τ=4, we need to go to y<=4, so must go down to y=4 or lower.\n\nBut to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=5 to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=4 safe.\n\nAnd at τ=3, y=5 safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, we are at y=5.\n\nHow to get to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nStart τ=0 y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, action S, to y=5 at τ=2? Action at τ=1: if S, then position at τ=2 is y=5.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, action: to go to y<=4 at τ=4, but τ=4 is two steps ahead.\n\nAt τ=2, we choose action for position at τ=3.\n\nIf at τ=2, we choose D, to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=4 dangerous! Because y=4 dangerous at τ=3.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at τ=2, we choose S, to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, choose D, to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=4 safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, we are at y=5, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0 (t6): y=4, action U → to y=5 at τ=1 (t7)\n\nτ=1 (t7): y=5, action S → to y=5 at τ=2 (t8)  // stay\n\nτ=2 (t8): y=5, action S → to y=5 at τ=3 (t9)  // or D? If S, stay at y=5\n\nThen τ=3 (t9): y=5, action D → to y=4 at τ=4 (t10)\n\nτ=4 (t10): y=4, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up.\n\nAt τ=4 (t10): y=4, action U → to y=5 at τ=5 (t11)\n\nτ=5 (t11): y=5, action U → to y=6 at τ=6 (t12)\n\nτ=6 (t12): y=6, action U → to y=7 at τ=7 (t13)\n\nτ=7 (t13): y=7, action U → to y=8 at τ=8 (t14)\n\nτ=8 (t14): y=8, action U → to y=9 at τ=9 (t15)\n\nReached y=9 at turn 15, same as before.\n\nBut in this case, we used one down move at τ=3, but we stayed at y=5 for two turns.\n\nActions: a_6=U, a_7=S, a_8=S, a_9=D, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, a_14=U\n\na_9=D at turn 9, to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nThen up to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nNow, H is number of actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, and at turn 6+H-1 y=9.\n\nHere turn 15, so 6+H-1=15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we don't delay.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 before τ=4, but impossible.\n\nOr after τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, we must be low.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 before τ=4, but impossible since max y at τ=4 is 8.\n\nSo min τ to reach y=9 is 5, at τ=5 with all up, but we had collision at y=8 τ=4.\n\nBut if we can avoid that collision by not being there.\n\nBut we have to be there at some point.\n\nFor example, if we go up but slower, so that at τ=4 we are lower.\n\nThen at τ=4 we are at y=4, for example, then go up to y=8 at τ=8, which is safe, then to y=9.\n\nBut τ=8 is later than τ=4.\n\nIn all up, we would be at y=8 at τ=4, but dangerous.\n\nIf we reach y=8 at τ=5, for example.\n\nHow? Start at y=4 τ=0.\n\nIf we do one stay, then at τ=1 y=4, then U to y=5 τ=2, U to y=6 τ=3, U to y=7 τ=4, but at τ=4 y=7 dangerous.\n\nThen U to y=8 τ=5, but at τ=5 y=8 safe, since only dangerous τ=4.\n\nThen U to y=9 τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=7 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nIf we start with down, but worse.\n\nSo the only way is to be below at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, min H is larger.\n\nBut in the sequence with H=10, we reach at τ=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce.\n\nNotice that after τ=4, no immediate danger, so we can go up fast.\n\nIn the sequence, from τ=4 y=4 to y=9 at τ=9, 5 up moves, 5 turns, but from τ=4 to τ=9, 5 steps.\n\nBut we spent from τ=0 to τ=4 to go from y=4 to y=4, so wasted 4 turns to stay low.\n\nBut we had to avoid danger.\n\nAnother point: at τ=3, we can be on y=8 if possible, but not.\n\ny=8 at τ=3 safe, but can't reach.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=1 or something, but not efficient.\n\nI think H=10 is the best we can do.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach faster.\n\nSuppose we go up directly but pause at some point.\n\nFor example, start U at τ=0 to y=5 τ=1\n\nU to y=6 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2 y=6, instead of U, we choose S, stay at y=6 for τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, action: to go to y=6 or other at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=6 dangerous, so we cannot stay or go up, must go down.\n\nBut down to y=5 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nIf at τ=2, we go down to y=5 at τ=3, then at τ=3 y=5, then down to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3 y=5 safe, τ=4 y=4 safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=4, go up.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10, with sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions including down or stay.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I thought: with two downs or with stay and down.\n\nBut in terms of number of turns, same H.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with only one down or less delay.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, U to y=5 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, U to y=6 τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, U to y=7 τ=3\n\nNow at τ=3 y=7, we need to go down to avoid danger at τ=4, but to where? If down to y=6 at τ=4, dangerous; to y=7 dangerous; no.\n\nUnless we go down multiple steps, but can't.\n\nSo must go down before.\n\nThus, I think it's necessary to be low at τ=4.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=5 at turn 7)\n\nTurn 7: S  (stay at y=5 at turn 8)  // or U, but if U to y=6 at turn 8\n\nEarlier with U at turn 7 to y=6 at turn 8.\n\nThen turn 8: D to y=5 at turn 9\n\nThen turn 9: D to y=4 at turn 10\n\nBut at turn 9, position y=5, action D, to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nThen turn 10: U to y=5 at turn 11\n\netc.\n\nIn the stay version: turn 6: U to y=5 turn 7\n\nTurn 7: S to y=5 turn 8\n\nTurn 8: S to y=5 turn 9  // but at turn 9 τ=3, y=5\n\nThen turn 9: D to y=4 turn 10\n\nThen turn 10: U to y=5 turn 11\n\n...\n\nBut in this, from turn 7 to turn 9, we stayed at y=5 for three turns? Turn 7,8,9 all at y=5?\n\nAt turn 7: after action, y=5\n\nAt turn 8: after action S, y=5\n\nAt turn 9: after action S, y=5? No.\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=2), position y=5 (from previous)\n\nChoose action a_8=S, then at turn 9 (τ=3), y=5\n\nThen at turn 9 (τ=3), choose a_9=D, then at turn 10 (τ=4), y=4\n\nSo positions: turn 7: y=5, turn 8: y=5, turn 9: y=5, turn 10: y=4\n\nThen turn 10: U to y=5 turn 11, etc.\n\nBut at turn 9 (τ=3), we are at y=5, which is fine, but we used more stay actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we should move up as much as possible when safe.\n\nIn the first approach with fewer stays: turn 6: U to y=5 turn 7\n\nTurn 7: U to y=6 turn 8\n\nTurn 8: D to y=5 turn 9\n\nTurn 9: D to y=4 turn 10\n\nThen turn 10: U to y=5 turn 11\n\nTurn 11: U to y=6 turn 12\n\nTurn 12: U to y=7 turn 13\n\nTurn 13: U to y=8 turn 14\n\nTurn 14: U to y=9 turn 15\n\nReached at turn 15.\n\nWith actions: U, U, D, D, U, U, U, U, U\n\n9 actions? Turns: actions from turn 6 to turn 14, that's 9 actions.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 14 inclusive is 9 turns? Turn 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: 9 actions.\n\nAfter these, position at turn 15 is y=9.\n\nSo H=9? t_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1=15, so 5 + H =15, H=10? 6+H-1=15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, here to t=14, so 14=6+H-1, so H-1=8, H=9? Let's calculate.\n\nStart: turn 6, position y=4.\n\nAfter action a_6, position at turn 7.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{14}, position at turn 15.\n\nWe have actions a_6 to a_14, that's 9 actions (turns 6 to 14).\n\nNumber of actions: from index 0 to 8 for t from 6 to 14, 9 actions.\n\nThen position at turn 15 is y=9.\n\nTurn 15 is t_1 + (H-1) =6 + (H-1)\n\nSet equal to 15, so 6 + H-1 =15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, so 9 actions, H=9? Inconsistency.\n\nDefine H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H is set, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nWith actions from t=0 to H-1, the position after k actions is at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, turn t_1, position initial.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn t_1 +1, position updated.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1, position y=9.\n\nThat means after H-1 actions, at turn t_1 + (H-1), y=9.\n\nAnd the last action is a_{t_1 + H -2} or something.\n\nFor example, in the path, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nTurn 15 = t_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1\n\nSo 6 + H -1 =15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to 9: a_{6+0} to a_{6+9} = a_6 to a_15? t from 0 to H-1=9, so a_6 to a_{15}, but a_{15} is at turn 15, which affects position at turn 16.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning that at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is (0,9).\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δ y_t\" so at turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor T=15, t_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1 =15, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: a_6 to a_{15}, but a_{15} is chosen at turn 15, which sets y_{16}, but we care about y_{15}, which is before a_{15}.\n\nAt turn T=15, y_{15}=9, and we have actions from a_6 to a_{14}, because a_{14} is chosen at turn 14, sets y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}.\n\nThen at turn 15, we are at y_{15}, and no action needed if we stop.\n\nThe sequence of actions is up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which for H=10, t_1=6, a_6 to a_{15}, but a_{15} sets y_{16}, which is after we reached y_{15}=9.\n\nBut we don't care about after.\n\nIn the action list, we include a_6 to a_{14} to reach y_{15}=9.\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nWe want y_T =9 at T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nFor example, to reach y_T=9 at T, the last action is a_{T-1}, which sets y_T.\n\nBecause y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1} from action a_{T-1}.\n\nSo actions from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1, so actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}? Messy.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen actions are a_{t_1} to a_{T-1} = a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1 actions.\n\nBut T = t_1 + H -1, so T - t_1 = H-1 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, which includes from turn t_1 to turn T, that's H turns.\n\nBut actions are from turn t_1 to turn T-1, H-1 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it's {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these actions, position at turn t_1 + H is set, but we want at turn t_1 + H -1 position 9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, before action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1 + H -1} to go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo the action at turn t_1 + H -1 is not necessary for reaching y=9, but it is part of the sequence up to that point.\n\nIn practice, for the sequence, we include a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but when we reach y_{t_1 + H -1}=9, the action a_{t_1 + H -1} might change it, but since we stop, we don't care, or we can set it to S or something.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"reach (0,9)\", so at that turn, position is (0,9), and the action for that turn might be specified, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in the sequence, when we have y_T=9 at turn T, we can have action a_T, but it doesn't change y_T.\n\nIn the action list, for turn T, if we include a_T, it is for the action at that turn, but since we reached, it could be S or U or D, but y_T is already 9, so if we do U or D, y_{T+1} changes, but we don't care.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence to reach, so probably the actions up to reaching.\n\nI think for the sequence, we include actions until the turn before reaching or including.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it shows Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in the path, we reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nSo T=15.\n\nt_1=6, so T=6 + H -1=15, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from turn 6 to turn 15, but at turn 15, we are at y=9, and we choose action a_15, which can be S, for example.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with U,U,D,D,U,U,U,U,U for turns 6 to 14, and at turn 15, we need action, but y is already 9, so a_15 can be S.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo list:\n\nTurn 6: U  // to y=5 at turn 7\n\nTurn 7: U  // to y=6 at turn 8\n\nTurn 8: D  // to y=5 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9: D  // to y=4 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: U  // to y=5 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: U  // to y=6 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: U  // to y=7 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: U  // to y=8 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: U  // to y=9 at turn 15\n\nNow at turn 15, y=9, we need to include action for turn 15? Since H=10, actions up to a_{6+9}=a_15.\n\nAt turn 15, we can choose a_15=S, for example.\n\nThen position at turn 16 is still y=9, but we don't care.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S  // or whatever, but S is fine.\n\nBut we reached at turn 15, so action at turn 15 is not necessary, but included.\n\nTo have minimal H, H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller?\n\nSuppose we reach at turn 10, for example.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nBut from y=4 at turn 6, to y=9 at turn 10, that's 4 steps: turn 7,8,9,10 positions.\n\nAt turn 10, y=9.\n\nActions at turn 6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter 4 actions, position at turn 10.\n\nMin to increase y by 5 in 4 steps, but from turn 6 to turn 10, positions at turn 7,8,9,10.\n\nIf all U, then at turn 7 y=5, turn 8 y=6, turn 9 y=7, turn 10 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 10, we need at turn 10 y=9, so from turn 6 y=4, after a_6, turn 7 y=5; a_7, turn 8 y=6; a_8, turn 9 y=7; a_9, turn 10 y=8? Max y=8 at turn 10 with 4 up moves.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9, with y_9 <=8, so y_10 <=9, but to have y_10=9, need y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\nBut at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check collisions.\n\nFor example, if all U: a_6=U, to y=5 turn 7\n\na_7=U, to y=6 turn 8\n\na_8=U, to y=7 turn 9\n\na_9=U, to y=8 turn 10? a_9 at turn 9, to y_10.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9.\n\nIf at turn 9, y_9=7 (after a_8), then a_9=U, y_10=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y_10=9, need y_9=8 and a_9=U.\n\nBut y_9=8 at turn 9.\n\nHow to have y_9=8.\n\nFrom start, turn 6 y=4\n\na_6=U, turn 7 y=5\n\na_7=U, turn 8 y=6\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=7\n\nThen a_9=U, turn 10 y=8\n\nStill not 9.\n\na_6=U, turn 7 y=5\n\na_7=U, turn 8 y=6\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=7\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=8\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 11, with a_10=U.\n\nSo earliest at turn 11 with all up, but at turn 10 y=8, τ=4 (since τ=t-6, turn 10 is τ=4), y=8 dangerous, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nWith other moves, but to reach faster, impossible since min 5 moves to increase y by 5.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need +5, so min 5 actions, reaching at turn 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, τ=5, y=9.\n\nIn all up: turn 6: U to y=5 turn 7\n\nTurn 7: U to y=6 turn 8\n\nTurn 8: U to y=7 turn 9\n\nTurn 9: U to y=8 turn 10\n\nTurn 10: U to y=9 turn 11\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=4), y=8, dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we can avoid being on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nBut at turn 10, τ=4, we are at y=8 if we arrived there.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at turn 10, but turn 10 is τ=4, y=7 dangerous.\n\nOr lower.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 11, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nSo must be on y=8 at τ=4, dangerous.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach by turn 11 without collision.\n\nWith H smaller than 10, but turn 11 is t_1 + H -1 =6 + H -1=11, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nBut with collision.\n\nNext is turn 12, H=7, etc., but we reached at turn 15 with H=10.\n\nTurn 12: t_1 + H -1=12, 6+H-1=12, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nCan we reach by turn 12?\n\ny_12=9.\n\nThen from turn 6 to 12, 6 steps: positions turn 7 to 12.\n\nActions a6 to a11, 6 actions, to reach y12=9.\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11, so need y11=8 and a11=U, or y11=9 and a11=S, but y11=9 only if previous.\n\nBut min, y11=8, a11=U to y12=9.\n\nNow, to have y11=8.\n\nSince we have flexibility, we can avoid the danger at τ=4.\n\nFor example, be at y=4 at τ=4 turn 10.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nAt turn 10 y=4, a10=U to y=5 turn 11\n\na11=U to y=6 turn 12\n\nBut y12=6, not 9.\n\nTo reach y12=9, need to be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, if we are at y=7, but at τ=4, y=7 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt turn 11, τ=5, we can be at y=8, safe, then a11=U to y=9 turn 12.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 is τ=5.\n\nHow to reach y=8 by turn 11.\n\nFrom turn 6 y=4, to y=8 at turn 11, which is after 5 actions: turn 7 to 11 positions.\n\nWith 4 up moves, y=8 at turn 11? Let's see: turn 6 y=4\n\na6=U, turn 7 y=5\n\na7=U, turn 8 y=6\n\na8=U, turn 9 y=7\n\na9=U, turn 10 y=8\n\na10=U, turn 11 y=9\n\nBut at turn 10 y=8, τ=4 dangerous.\n\nIf we have a sequence where at turn 10 we are not at y=8.\n\nBut to have y=8 at turn 11, need at turn 10 y=7 or 8 or 9.\n\nIf y=7 at turn 10, τ=4 dangerous.\n\ny=8 dangerous.\n\ny=9 at turn 10, then y=8 at turn 11? Not.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 11, position y11=8.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nSo y10 could be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y10=7, then a10=U to y11=8\n\nBut y10=7 at τ=4 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if y10=8, a10=S or D to y11=8, but y10=8 at τ=4 dangerous.\n\nIf y10=9, a10=D to y11=8, but y10=9 not dangerous, but then we go down, inefficient.\n\nAnd y10=9 at turn 10 is early, from y=4 at turn 6, to y=9 at turn 10, as before, impossible with 4 actions.\n\nMax y at turn 10 is 8 with all up.\n\nSo cannot have y10=9.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=8 at turn 11, we must have y10=7 or 8, both dangerous at τ=4.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 by turn 12 without being in danger at some point.\n\nSimilarly for turn 13, etc.\n\nTurn 14: y14=9, t_1 + H -1=14, 6+H-1=14, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nCan we?\n\ny14=9.\n\nThen need y13=8 and a13=U.\n\ny13=8 at turn 13, τ=7.\n\ny=8 dangerous only at τ=4, so at τ=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y13=8.\n\nFrom start, with 7 actions, we can reach y13=8 safely.\n\nFor example, avoid τ=4 danger.\n\nBe at y=4 at τ=4 turn 10.\n\nThen from turn 10 y=4, a10=U to y=5 turn 11\n\na11=U to y=6 turn 12\n\na12=U to y=7 turn 13\n\nThen a13=U to y=8 turn 14? a13 at turn 13 to y14.\n\ny14 = y13 + Δy13.\n\nIf at turn 13 y13=7, a13=U to y14=8.\n\nBut we want y14=9? For turn 14 position y14=9.\n\nIf y14=9, need y13=8 or 9 and action.\n\nBut with y13=7, a13=U to y14=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y14=9, need y13=8 and a13=U, or y13=9 and a13=S.\n\ny13=9 at turn 13.\n\nBut to reach y13=9 from y=4 at turn 6.\n\nWith 7 actions: a6 to a12, positions turn 7 to 13.\n\ny13=9.\n\nWith 6 up moves and one other, but min 5 up, so possible.\n\nFor example, all U except one S or D.\n\nBut need to avoid danger.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=4 turn 10, we need to be y<=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2,3 not on y=2,3,4.\n\nNow, turn 10 is τ=4.\n\nTo be at y<=4 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 position.\n\nFrom turn 6 y=4.\n\nActions a6 to a9 affect positions turn 7 to 10.\n\n4 actions.\n\nTo have y10 <=4.\n\nSince start y=4, we can have stays or down.\n\nThen from turn 10 y<=4, go up to y13=9.\n\nBut y13=9 need from y10 to y13 in 3 steps, max increase 3, so if y10=4, to y13=7 max, not 9.\n\nIf y10=4, a10=U, y11=5; a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; then a13=U, y14=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y13=9, need y12=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y10=4, y12<=6, so y13<=7.\n\nImpossible to reach y13=9 with y10<=4.\n\nIf at turn 10 we are higher, but at τ=4, if y10=5,6,7,8 dangerous.\n\nSo cannot be high at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach by turn 13 or 14 with H smaller.\n\nTurn 15 is possible with H=10.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nNow for the sequence, I can use the one with U,U,D,D,U,U,U,U,U,S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 15, we set a15=S.\n\nTo have no down, but with stay.\n\nFor example: turn 6: U to y=5 turn7\n\nTurn7: S to y=5 turn8  // stay\n\nTurn8: S to y=5 turn9  // stay\n\nTurn9: D to y=4 turn10\n\nTurn10: U to y=5 turn11\n\nTurn11: U to y=6 turn12\n\nTurn12: U to y=7 turn13\n\nTurn13: U to y=8 turn14\n\nTurn14: U to y=9 turn15\n\nThen turn15: S (action)\n\nBut in this, we have one down and two stays, but same H.\n\nThe first with two downs might be better since less stay.\n\nBut both H=10.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at (24,13,right,12) which never dangerous, and another at (-48,-59,right,12) dangerous at τ=4.\n\nBut we handled.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + 10 - 1 = 15\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous positions at critical times. Specifically:\n- At \\(\\tau = t - 6 = 4\\) (turn 10), freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous due to car positions. Therefore, the player must be at \\(y \\leq 4\\) at turn 10.\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turns 8 and 9), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are dangerous, so the player must avoid these positions.\n\nThe sequence moves up initially to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 8, then moves down to \\(y = 4\\) by turn 10 to avoid the danger at \\(\\tau = 4\\). From turn 10 onwards, the player moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 15, as no collisions occur after \\(\\tau = 4\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 6 (τ=0)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7).  \n  - Position at turn 7: \\(y = 5\\), which is safe (freeway 5 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=1 is safe).\n- **Turn 7 (τ=1)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8).  \n  - Position at turn 8: \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (freeway 6 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=2 is safe).\n- **Turn 8 (τ=2)**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 9).  \n  - Position at turn 9: \\(y = 5\\), which is safe (freeway 5 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=3 is safe, and \\(y = 5\\) avoids the danger at τ=2 for \\(y = 2,3,4\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (τ=3)**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10).  \n  - Position at turn 10: \\(y = 4\\), which is safe (freeway 4 dangerous only at τ=2 and τ=3; τ=4 is safe, and \\(y \\leq 4\\) avoids the danger at τ=4 for \\(y = 5,6,7,8\\)).\n- **Turn 10 (τ=4)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11).  \n  - Position at turn 11: \\(y = 5\\), which is safe (freeway 5 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=5 is safe).\n- **Turn 11 (τ=5)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12).  \n  - Position at turn 12: \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (freeway 6 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=6 is safe).\n- **Turn 12 (τ=6)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13).  \n  - Position at turn 13: \\(y = 7\\), which is safe (freeway 7 dangerous only at τ=0 and τ=4; τ=7 is safe).\n- **Turn 13 (τ=7)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14).  \n  - Position at turn 14: \\(y = 8\\), which is safe (freeway 8 dangerous only at τ=4; τ=8 is safe).\n- **Turn 14 (τ=8)**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15).  \n  - Position at turn 15: \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (no freeway at y=9).\n- **Turn 15 (τ=9)**: Action \\(S\\) (stay, as position (0, 9) is reached).  \n  - The action at turn 15 does not change the position, as the goal is already achieved.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified against the car positions and their dangerous times. The minimal \\(H\\) is 10, as fewer turns would either not reach \\(y = 9\\) or result in a collision (e.g., at turn 10 with \\(y = 8\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) on turn t1, which is given as t0 = 9. So current turn is 9, and y=5.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction. Left-moving cars decrease their positions, right-moving increase.\n\nFrom the car state table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-36, -47, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the head is at -36, tail at -47? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me read the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h], with τ and h, and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's (-36, -47, right, 3). But according to the notation, for right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? But -47 and -36, with -36 > -47, so if right-moving, head should be on the right, so if x increases to the right, head at -36, tail at -47 makes sense, since -36 > -47.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it was [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the directions given.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head = -36, tail = -47? The notation says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] for the span, which is confusing.\n\nI think I need to interpret the car state based on the direction.\n\nPerhaps the pair given is always (head, tail), and we need to apply the movement based on direction.\n\nFor freeway 1: (head, tail) = (-36, -47), direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction is right, the car is moving right, so at time t, the span is [min, max] but moving right, so tail should be left, head right.\n\nHere, tail = -47, head = -36, so min x = -47, max x = -36? But since moving right, as time increases, both increase.\n\nThe update rule says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for this car, at t1=9, τ = -47, h = -36, s=3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4: all (6, -5, right, 6). head=6, tail=-5? tail=-5, head=6, so min x=-5, max x=6.\n\nBut -5 < 6, so for right-moving, tail at -5, head at 6.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: two cars each. For freeway 5: (36,25, right,12) and (-12,-23, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=36, tail=25? But 25 < 36, so tail=25, head=36 for right-moving? But the notation says (head, tail), so for first car head=36, tail=25, but if moving right, tail should be less than head, 25<36, yes.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12, with -23 < -12.\n\nAnd freeway 8: (60,49, right,12) and (-12,-23, right,12), similar.\n\nNow, the player is on y=5 at turn t1=9, but y=5 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 has cars.\n\nThe player needs to move to (0,9), which is y=9, and since y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there, so when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nStart at y=5, goal y=9, so need to move up 4 times, but with possible detours to avoid cars.\n\nSince moving up directly might hit a car, or if we move down, but that would take more turns, so we want minimal turns, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, at each turn, when we are on a certain y, we need to ensure that at that turn, for that freeway, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThe span is in x-direction, and player is at x=0 always, I assume, since position is (0,y), so we care if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFor a given freeway and turn, we need to check for each car on that freeway whether 0 is in [min, max] of its span at that turn.\n\nSince the spans move with constant speed.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=9.\n\nWe need to find actions for turns starting from t1=9 onwards.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number relative to t1. So at t=0, turn t1, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so after H turns, at turn t1 + H - 1, y should be 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0,y_t1)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we move to y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy, at turn t1+1.\n\nThen after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, with position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn when we are on y=1 to 8.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then for that freeway k=y_T, we check if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf we move to a new y at turn T+1, we are not on that new y until turn T+1.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we start at y=5, need to get to y=9, the minimal moves would be 4 up moves, so H=4, if no collisions.\n\nBut we need to check if we can go directly up without hitting cars.\n\nFirst, let's find the car positions at various turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=9.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to know when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, we can compute for each freeway and each turn around now, whether it is safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut since the player's y changes, we need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways with cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, h=-36, τ=-47 at t=9, s=3.\n\nSpan at time T: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-47 + 3(T-9), -36 + 3(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 3(T-9) <= 0 <= -36 + 3(T-9)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car, (h=6, τ=-5, right, s=6) at t=9.\n\nSpan: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-5 + 6(T-9), 6 + 6(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6(T-9) <= 0 <= 6 + 6(T-9)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (6,-5,right,6), so identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also same (6,-5,right,6), so same as freeway 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=36, τ=25, right, s=12) at t=9. τ=25, h=36, so for right-moving, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nBut 25 + 12(T-9) and 36 + 12(T-9), since T-9 >=0, this is always positive and increasing, so min x=25 +12(T-9) >25>0 for T>=9, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=12) at t=9.\n\nSpan [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-23 + 12(T-9), -12 + 12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12(T-9) <= 0 <= -12 +12(T-9)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7: same as freeway 5, since cars are identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12), same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=60, τ=49, right, s=12), span [49 +12(T-9), 60+12(T-9)] >49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: same as others, (-12,-23,right,12), span [-23 +12(T-9), -12 +12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12(T-9) <=0 <= -12 +12(T-9)\n\nNow, for freeways 2,3,4: all have the same car: (6,-5,right,6), so we can treat them similarly, but since they are different freeways, we need to consider each separately, but since the car is the same, the safety condition is the same for all at a given turn.\n\nBut for a specific freeway, at turn T, if we are on it, we check the cars on that freeway.\n\nSince freeways 2,3,4 have identical cars, the times when 0 is in the span are the same.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 5,6,7 have two cars, but the first car never covers 0, only the second car can, and it's the same for all, so same unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car that can cover 0, the second car.\n\nFreeway 1 has its own car.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car span [-47 +3(T-9), -36 +3(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +3(T-9) <= 0 <= -36 +3(T-9)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -47 +3(T-9) <= 0 => 3(T-9) <= 47 => T-9 <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so T <= 9 + 15.666 = 24.666, so T <= 24 since integer.\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +3(T-9) => 36 <= 3(T-9) => 12 <= T-9 => T >= 21\n\nSo for T from 21 to 24 inclusive.\n\n0 in span when T=21,22,23,24.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt T=21: -47 +3(12) = -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0 <=0, so 0 is included (since <= on both sides).\n\nThe inequality: min <= 0 <= max, so at T=21, min = -47 +3(12) = -47+36=-11, max = -36+36=0, so -11 <= 0 <= 0, true.\n\nT=22: min=-47+3(13)= -47+39= -8, max=-36+39=3, so -8<=0<=3, true.\n\nT=23: min=-47+42= -5, max=-36+42=6, -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nT=24: min=-47+45= -2, max=-36+45=9, -2<=0<=9 true.\n\nT=25: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, 1<=0? 1>0, so 0< min, not in span.\n\nT=20: min=-47+3(11)= -47+33= -14, max=-36+33= -3, -14<=0<= -3? 0 <= -3 false, since 0 > -3.\n\nSo unsafe for T=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4: car span [-5 +6(T-9), 6 +6(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -5 +6(T-9) <= 0 <= 6 +6(T-9)\n\nLeft: -5 +6(T-9) <=0 => 6(T-9) <=5 => T-9 <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so T <= 9.833, since T integer, T<=9\n\nBut T is turn, T>=9.\n\nAt T=9: min= -5 +6(0)= -5 <=0, max=6+0=6 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nT=10: min= -5 +6(1)=1, max=6+6=12, 1<=0? false.\n\nSo only at T=9, 0 is in span for freeway 2,3,4.\n\nAt T=9, min=-5, max=6, -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nT=10: min=1, max=12, 1>0, not <=0? min=1, 0<1, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly for higher T, min increases.\n\nSo for freeway 2,3,4, unsafe only at turn T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7: first car never unsafe, as min>0.\n\nSecond car: span [-23 +12(T-9), -12 +12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12(T-9) <=0 <= -12 +12(T-9)\n\nLeft: -23 +12(T-9) <=0 => 12(T-9) <=23 => T-9 <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so T<=10.916, T<=10\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +12(T-9) => 12 <= 12(T-9) => 1 <= T-9 => T >=10\n\nSo T>=10 and T<=10, so only T=10.\n\nCheck:\n\nT=10: min= -23 +12(1)= -23+12= -11 <=0, max= -12+12=0 <=0, so -11<=0<=0, true.\n\nT=9: min= -23 +0 = -23 <=0, max= -12 <=0, but 0 <= max? max=-12, 0 <= -12? false, 0 > -12, so not <= max.\n\nT=11: min= -23 +24=1? 12*(2)=24, min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, 1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=10 for freeway 5,6,7.\n\nNow freeway 8: first car never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: same as above, [-23 +12(T-9), -12 +12(T-9)], so unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same second car: (-12,-23,right,12), so yes, unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the unsafe turns:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 21,22,23,24\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4: unsafe only at turn 9\n\n- Freeway 5,6,7: unsafe only at turn 10\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe only at turn 10\n\nAt turn T, for freeway k, unsafe if T in those turns.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t1=9, y=5.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which has cars.\n\nAt turn 9, is freeway 5 unsafe?\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=10, not at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, for freeway 5: second car min=-23, max=-12, 0 not <= max since max=-12<0, so 0 not in span, so safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut we are at turn 9, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nNow, we need to choose action a_{9} (turn t1=9).\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=6 at turn 10.\n\nIf down, to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nIf stay, y=5 at turn 10.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, at turn 9: we are on y=5, which is safe, as above.\n\nAfter action, at turn 10, we will be on some y.\n\nNow, at turn 10, which freeways are unsafe?\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 unsafe at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8 also unsafe at T=10.\n\nFreeway 1 safe at T=10, since unsafe only later.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 safe at T=10, unsafe only at T=9.\n\nSo at turn 10, unsafe freeways: 5,6,7,8.\n\nThat is, y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe at turn 10.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 are safe at turn 10.\n\ny=1: at T=10, freeway 1 is safe, since unsafe only at 21-24.\n\ny=2,3,4: unsafe only at T=9, so at T=10 safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow, back to choosing action at turn 9.\n\nCurrent y=5 at turn 9, safe.\n\nAfter action a9:\n\n- If U: y_{10} =6\n\nThen at turn 10, on y=6, which is unsafe (since freeway 6 unsafe at T=10), collision.\n\n- If D: y_{10} =4\n\nAt turn 10, on y=4, freeway 4. Freeway 4 is safe at T=10 (unsafe only at T=9), so safe.\n\n- If S: y_{10} =5\n\nAt turn 10, on y=5, which is unsafe at T=10, collision.\n\nSo only possible safe action at turn 9 is D, to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nWe must go down to avoid collision.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, at turn 10, which is safe, as above.\n\nNow, we need to choose action a_{10} for turn 10.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U: to y=5 at turn 11\n\nIf D: to y=3 at turn 11\n\nIf S: y=4 at turn 11\n\nNow, at turn 11, what is safe?\n\nFirst, find unsafe turns for each freeway at T=11.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only 21-24, so T=11 safe.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: unsafe only T=9, so T=11 safe.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: unsafe only T=10, so T=11 safe.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe only T=10, so T=11 safe.\n\nAll freeways safe at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns until 21.\n\nNow, we are at turn 10, y=4.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4, we need to go up 5 times to reach y=9.\n\nBut we can do it in multiple turns.\n\nSince all positions are safe at turn 11 and later until 21, we can move freely, but we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal turns: we need to gain 5 in y, from y=4 to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so at least 5 up moves.\n\nBut we can do it in 5 turns if we go up every time.\n\nNow, at turn 10, after action, we go to turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, we choose action.\n\nIf we go up at turn 10: to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, y=5 is safe, since all safe at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up again, to y=6 at turn 12, etc., all should be safe until we reach y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if there are any unsafe turns soon.\n\nThe next unsafe is freeway 1 at T=21-24, but that's far away, and we should reach y=9 before that.\n\nSince we start from turn 10, y=4.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nTurn 10: action U, to y=5 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: action U, to y=6 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: action U, to y=7 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: action U, to y=8 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: action U, to y=9 at turn 15\n\nAt turn 15, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nNow, check collisions during the path:\n\nAt turn 10: we are at y=4 (after action, but at turn 10, we are on y=4 before action? Let's clarify.\n\nAt the start of turn T, we are at position (0, y_T).\n\nWe choose action a_T, then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T, based on y_T.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn 10: we are at y=4 (since we came from turn 9 down action).\n\nThen we choose a_{10}.\n\nIf we choose U, then at turn 10, we are on y=4, which is safe (freeway 4 safe at T=10).\n\nAfter action, we move to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nNow at turn 11, we are on y=5, and turn 11, freeway 5 is safe (unsafe only at T=10).\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, we choose action, say U, then move to y=6 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, on y=6, freeway 6 safe at T=12 (unsafe only T=10).\n\nSimilarly, turn 12 action U to y=7 turn 13, safe.\n\nTurn 13 U to y=8 turn 14, at turn 14 on y=8, freeway 8 safe at T=14 (unsafe only T=10).\n\nThen turn 14 U to y=9 turn 15, at turn 15 y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reach at turn 15, with y=9.\n\nBut we started at turn 9, and after 5 actions: turn 9,10,11,12,13,14? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart: turn t1=9, y=5.\n\nAfter action a9 (which is D), at turn 10, y=4.\n\nThen a10: U, to turn 11, y=5\n\na11: U, to turn 12, y=6\n\na12: U, to turn 13, y=7\n\na13: U, to turn 14, y=8\n\na14: U, to turn 15, y=9\n\nSo we reached at turn 15, after 6 actions: from turn 9 to 14 inclusive, that's 6 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere, from turn 9 to turn 15, that's 6 turns later? Turn 9 to turn 10 is one step, etc.\n\nInitial turn: t1=9, position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 9.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn 10.\n\nAfter second action a_{t1+1}, at turn 11, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this path: after a9 (D) at turn 10, y=4\n\nAfter a10 (U) at turn 11, y=5\n\nAfter a11 (U) at turn 12, y=6\n\nAfter a12 (U) at turn 13, y=7\n\nAfter a13 (U) at turn 14, y=8\n\nAfter a14 (U) at turn 15, y=9\n\nSo after 6 actions, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut we could have reached faster? Minimal would be 4 up moves, but we had to go down first, so it took 6 turns.\n\nAt turn 9, we had to go down to avoid collision at turn 10 if we stayed or went up.\n\nIs there a way to go up later without going down?\n\nFor example, at turn 9, instead of going down, could we stay? But if stay, at turn 10 y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf up, to y=6 at turn 10, unsafe.\n\nOnly down is safe.\n\nSo we must go down to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9, 5 steps, but since we start moving at turn 10, we reach at turn 15.\n\nTurn sequence: actions at turn 9,10,11,12,13,14 to reach turn 15 at y=9.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up faster or something.\n\nAfter turn 10, all is safe, so we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nMaybe we can stay at some point, but that would increase H, so not better.\n\nBut we need minimal H.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 9, we are at y=5, and if we could go directly, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps go down further? But that would take more turns to come back, so worse.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, y=4, we go down to y=3, then we need to go up more, so H larger.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the path above seems minimal H=6.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn 9: action D, to y=4 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: action U, to y=5 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: action U, to y=6 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: action U, to y=7 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: action U, to y=8 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: action U, to y=9 at turn 15\n\nAt each point, no collision.\n\nAt turn 10: y=4, which is freeway 4, at T=10, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=5, freeway 5, T=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 1 unsafe later, but we are done by turn 15, before 21, so no issue.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose at turn 9, we go down to y=4.\n\nThen at turn 10, instead of going up immediately, but if we go up, it's fine.\n\nIf we stay at y=4, then at turn 11, we are still at y=4, then we go up, but that would take an extra turn, so we reach later, H larger.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, we stay, then at turn 11 y=4, then U to turn 12 y=5, and so on, reach at turn 16, worse.\n\nSo better to go up immediately.\n\nThus, H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from turn 9 to turn 14.\n\nThe answer should list actions starting from turn t1=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=6, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 5, i.e., turn 9 to 14.\n\nAnd the actions: turn 9: D, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} which is U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1 +5} which is U for turn 14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 +5, since H=6, H-1=5.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 14, we do U to go to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by not going down, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up at turn 9, but to a different y.\n\nBut at turn 9, if we go up to y=6, but at turn 10, y=6 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we could go to y=9 directly, but we can only move one step.\n\nPerhaps stay at turn 9, but then at turn 10 y=5 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nMaybe move to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but then we need to come up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, go down to y=4, but we did that.\n\nIf go down further to y=3, etc., worse.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states.\n\nAt turn 10, freeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nBut freeway 4 is safe at turn 10.\n\nWe are at y=4 turn 10.\n\nNow, if we could go to y=9 in fewer than 5 moves, impossible.\n\nAfter turn 10, all safe, so we can go up freely.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can skip, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or move down, but that delays.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about freeway 1, unsafe at 21-24, but we are done by 15, so no problem.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 15, y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nStart at turn 9 y=5.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at turn 14, y=?\n\nTo reach y=9, need net +4 in y.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so minimal 4 up actions, but with possible down or stay.\n\nIf we do 4 up and one down, net +3, not enough.\n\n4 up and one stay, net +4, but stay takes a turn.\n\nFor example, actions: U,U,U,U,S but with the constraints.\n\nBut at turn 9, we must go down, so we have at least one down action.\n\nIf we do D at turn 9, then to reach y=9, we need to compensate that down with extra up.\n\nFrom y=5, after D to y=4, then to y=9, need +5, so at least 5 up actions, but in sequence.\n\nWith H=5 actions: from turn 9 to 13 actions, reaching turn 14.\n\nIf at turn 9: D, to y=4 turn 10\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at turn 14, so from y=4 to y=9 in 4 actions? But 4 actions can increase y by at most 4, to y=8, not y=9.\n\ny start at turn 10: y=4\n\nAfter a10, to turn 11, y=?\n\nAfter a11, to turn 12, y=?\n\nAfter a12, to turn 13, y=?\n\nAfter a13, to turn 14, y=?\n\nWe want y at turn 14 to be 9.\n\ny_{14} = y_{10} + sum of Δy from t=10 to 13.\n\ny_{10} =4\n\nΔy_{10} to Δy_{13}, each between -1 and 1.\n\nSo y_{14} = 4 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nSet to 9, so Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13 = 5\n\nBut each <=1, so sum <=4, contradiction.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 at turn 14 from y=4 at turn 10 in 4 actions; maximal increase is 4, to y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, if we start from turn 9, after H actions at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=9, after H actions at turn 9+H.\n\ny=9.\n\nFrom y=5 at turn 9, to y=9, difference +4.\n\ny_{9+H} = 5 + sum_{t=9}^{9+H-1} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{t=9}^{9+H-1} Δy_t = 4\n\nNumber of terms: from t=9 to 9+H-1, that's H terms.\n\nEach Δy_t >= -1, <=1.\n\nSum =4, so H must be at least 4, but since we have to go down at first, we need extra up.\n\nIn general, with down actions, H increases.\n\nMinimal H: since we must have at least one down (or at turn 9 we go down), but actually, at turn 9, we go down, so one down, and we need net +4 from start, but start y=5, end y=9, net +4.\n\nBut we have one down action, so to compensate, we need one extra up, so at least 5 up actions and one down, but actions include U,D,S.\n\nThe sum of Δy over H actions must be +4.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S, with u + d + s = H.\n\nThen net Δy = u - d = 4.\n\nAlso u + d + s = H.\n\nNow, u = d + 4.\n\nThen H = u + d + s = (d+4) + d + s = 2d + s + 4\n\nSince s >=0, d >=0, minimal H when d and s small.\n\nBut d at least 1, because at turn 9 we must go down to avoid collision.\n\nIn this case, d=1, then u = d+4=5, then H = 2(1) + s +4 = 6 + s\n\nMinimal when s=0, H=6.\n\nIf we could have d=0, but we can't because at turn 9, going up or stay causes collision at turn 10.\n\nIf we go down multiple times, d>1, then u=d+4, H=2d+s+4, larger.\n\nSo minimal H=6 with d=1, u=5, s=0.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is minimal.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the turn numbers: t_1 is 9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nNow, write in boxed.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\n\nBut in our case, it didn't come up, because we were moving vertically only when safe.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=4 to y=5 at turn 10 (action U), at turn 10 we are on y=4, then after action, at turn 11 we are on y=5.\n\nAt turn 10, we are not on y=5, so even if y=5 unsafe at T=10, we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 6\\) turns.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Initial Position and Turn**: At turn 9, the player is at (0, 5). Freeway 5 (y=5) is safe at turn 9 because no car on freeway 5 has 0 in its span at this turn (the second car on freeway 5 has a span of [-23, -12] at turn 9, and 0 is not in this interval).\n- **Collision Avoidance at Turn 10**: Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are unsafe at turn 10 due to cars covering x=0. Specifically:\n  - Freeway 5: Unsafe at turn 10 (span of second car includes 0).\n  - Freeway 6: Unsafe at turn 10 (similar to freeway 5).\n  - Freeway 7: Unsafe at turn 10 (similar to freeway 5).\n  - Freeway 8: Unsafe at turn 10 (second car includes 0).\n- **Action at Turn 9**: Moving up (U) to y=6 or staying (S) at y=5 would place the player on an unsafe freeway (y=6 or y=5) at turn 10, causing a collision. Moving down (D) to y=4 is safe because freeway 4 (y=4) is safe at turn 10 (unsafe only at turn 9).\n- **Subsequent Turns**: After turn 10, all freeways are safe until turn 21 (when freeway 1 becomes unsafe, but this is irrelevant as the goal is reached by turn 15). Thus, moving up (U) repeatedly from turn 10 onwards is safe and minimizes turns.\n- **Minimal Turns**: \n  - Net change in y required: from 5 to 9, a +4 change.\n  - Due to the necessary down (D) action at turn 9 to avoid collision, one extra up (U) action is needed, resulting in 5 up actions and 1 down action over 6 turns.\n  - Attempts to achieve the goal in fewer turns (e.g., H=5) are impossible because:\n    - After the down action to y=4 at turn 10, 4 actions can increase y by at most +4 (to y=8), not reaching y=9.\n    - The sum of \\(\\Delta y\\) over H actions must be +4, but with one down action, at least 5 up actions are required, leading to H ≥ 6.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence starts at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) and consists of \\(H = 6\\) actions, reaching (0, 9) at turn 15.\n\n- **Turn 9 (current turn)**: Action D (move down to y=4 at turn 10). This avoids collision at turn 10, as freeway 4 is safe.\n- **Turn 10**: Action U (move up to y=5 at turn 11). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 10, and freeway 5 is safe at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Action U (move up to y=6 at turn 12). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 11, and freeway 6 is safe at turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Action U (move up to y=7 at turn 13). Freeway 6 is safe at turn 12, and freeway 7 is safe at turn 13.\n- **Turn 13**: Action U (move up to y=8 at turn 14). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 13, and freeway 8 is safe at turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: Action U (move up to y=9 at turn 15). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 14, and y=9 has no cars, so no collision.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal \\(H = 6\\) turns.\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: D \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n}",

The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and there's a car on that freeway where x=0 is within its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm still on y at turn T, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So I only need to worry about cars on the row I'm currently on when I'm there.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T.\n\nTime is measured in turns, so from turn t1=11, future turns are t=11,12,13,... and I need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so position at turn H should be (0,9).\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=11 to t=11+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=11+H-1, y=9. Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe player starts at turn t1=11, position y_{11} = 5.\n\nAfter one action a_{11}, at turn t=12, y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}.\n\nGenerally, after t actions from t1, at turn t1 + t, y_{t1+t} is set.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so after H actions, the turn is t1 + H, and y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nStart: turn t1, position y_{t1} = 5.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} (t=0), turn becomes t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-1}, turn becomes t1 + H, position y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we need y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t1=11, and for future turns, we compute their positions.\n\nEach car has a span [head, tail] or [tail, head] depending on direction, but since it's a span, we can think of the min and max x.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: at t1, span [h, τ], so h is left end, τ is right end? But it says head at h, tail at τ, and it moves left, so as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h], with τ left, h right? It says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nBut -30 and -41, if it's [τ,h] for right-moving, τ should be less than h? -41 < -30, so τ=-41, h=-30, so at t1, left end τ=-41, right end h=-30.\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-41 + 3(T-11), -30 + 3(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's list all cars clearly.\n\nFirst, freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn t1=11:\n\ny=1: one car: direction right, speed 3, head h=-30, tail τ=-41? From the notation: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor y=1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, and it says for right-moving: Span = [τ, h] with τ < h? But here τ=-41, h=-30, so τ < h, so left end τ, right end h.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], with h and τ such that h < τ or something? Not given, all are right-moving in this case? Let's see.\n\ny=1: one car, right, s=3, h=-30, τ=-41\n\ny=2: (18,7,right,6) but 18 and 7, 7<18, so τ=7? h=18? It says (head h, tail τ), so for right, if d=right, Span = [τ, h] with τ left, h right.\n\nHere for y=2: h=18, τ=7, so τ=7 < h=18, so left end 7, right end 18 at t1.\n\nBut at t1=11, position x=0, so we need to see when 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly y=3: (18,7,right,6) same as y=2? Probably a typo or same for multiple lanes? It says \"Cars\" so for each freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nLook at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nFreeway 2: (18,7,right,6) — I think this is one car, head 18, tail 7, right, speed 6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: (18,7,right,6) another car? Or same?\n\nThe way it's written: | 2 | (18, 7, right, 6) | so I think for each freeway, it lists the cars, and for y=2,3,4, it seems only one car each, but for y=5,6,7,8, there are two cars.\n\ny=5: (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12) so two cars.\n\nSimilarly y=6: same, (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: (-36,-47,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nAnd y=1: one car, y=2: one, y=3: one, y=4: one, but y=4 is listed as (18,7,right,6) same as y=2 and 3.\n\ny=4: in the table, | 4 | (18,7,right,6) | so one car.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 all have (18,7,right,6), which might be identical, but we treat them separately per freeway.\n\nNow for each car, we need to find when x=0 is in its span at a given turn T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, direction right, so for each car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with τ and h given at t1.\n\nt1=11.\n\nAnd collision if for the freeway y at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need to check all on that row.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at t=11.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there is no freeway y=9, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the edges, no cars, so only need to avoid cars on y=1 to 8 when on those rows.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=5, and y=9 is 4 steps up, the minimum possible H is 4, if we can go up each turn without collision.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when we are on a row, there is no car at x=0.\n\nAlso, when we move, we are on the starting row during the move action.\n\nLet's think carefully about the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nDuring the action at turn T, we are on row y_T, and we might collide with cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nAfter the action, at turn T+1, we are on row y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe fastest is to go up 4 times: actions U,U,U,U, so from t=11 to t=15, y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each of these turns, when on y=5,6,7,8 at turns t=11,12,13,14 respectively, that there is no car at x=0 on that row at that turn.\n\nt=11: y=5, we are on y=5 at turn 11.\n\nt=12: after action at t=11, y=6, so on y=6 at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, t=13: on y=7 at turn 13.\n\nt=14: on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nt=15: on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, check for y=5 at t=11.\n\nFreeway y=5 has two cars at t=11: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-11), h + s(T-11)]\n\nFirst car: head h=60, tail τ=49? (h,t) = (60,49), direction right, so since right, Span = [τ, h] = [49,60] at t1=11? τ=49, h=60, so [49,60] at t=11.\n\nThen at time T, [49 + 12(T-11), 60 + 12(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly second car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, so [1,12] at t=11, then at T, [1 + 12(T-11), 12 + 12(T-11)]\n\nNow at t=11, T=11, for first car: [49 + 0, 60 + 0] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so at t=11, on y=5, no collision, safe.\n\nNow at t=12, if we go to y=6, we need to be on y=6 at turn 12.\n\nFreeway y=6 has two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) same as y=5? No, y=6 has its own cars, but in the table, for y=6: (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12), same as y=5.\n\nBut different rows, so we need to check for each row separately.\n\nAt turn T=12, on freeway y=6.\n\nCars on y=6: first car: (60,49,right,12) so at T=12, span [49 + 12(12-11), 60 + 12(1)] = [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) at T=12: [1 + 12(1), 12 + 12(1)] = [13,24]\n\n0 not in [61,72] or [13,24], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, on y=7.\n\ny=7 cars: same as above, (60,49,right,12) at T=13: [49 + 12(13-11), 60 + 12(2)] = [49+24, 60+24] = [73,84]\n\nSecond car: [1 + 12(2), 12 + 24] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=14, on y=8.\n\ny=8 has cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12), h=-36, τ=-47? (head h, tail τ) = (-36,-47), direction right, so Span = [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t1=11.\n\nAt T=14, [ -47 + 12(14-11), -36 + 12(3) ] = [-47 + 36, -36 + 36] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 is in the span, since it includes 0.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], that means from x=-11 to x=0, so x=0 is the right end, which is included.\n\nSo at T=14, on y=8, car 1 has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so collision!\n\nTherefore, at turn 14, if we are on y=8, we collide with the first car.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=14, we are on y=8 if we went up at t=13.\n\nActions: at t=11, action U, to y=6 at t=12\n\nt=12, action U, to y=7 at t=13\n\nt=13, action U, to y=8 at t=14\n\nAt t=14, we are on y=8, and collision occurs.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, the direct U,U,U,U is not possible because of collision at t=14 on y=8.\n\nNow, we need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps go slower or change path.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we just need to reach it.\n\nMinimal H is at least 4, but might be more if we need to wait.\n\nH=4 not possible, so try H=5.\n\nWith H=5, we can have actions that include staying or moving down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nWe start at y=5, need to go to y=9, so net +4 in y, so with H turns, we have H actions, each can change y by -1,0,+1, so to increase by 4, we need at least 4 up moves, and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would require more ups, so minimal actions is with all ups, but we have collision, so we need to add waits or detours.\n\nBut detour down might not be efficient.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each turn around, when x=0 is occupied.\n\nWe need from turn t=11 to, say, t=20 or so, to see.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find the times when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we check at integer turns.\n\nt1=11.\n\nLet T be the turn number, Δt = T - 11.\n\nFor freeway y=1: one car: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nAt T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-41 + 3 Δt, -30 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 3 Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 3 Δt\n\nSo -41 + 3 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <= 41 => Δt <= 41/3 ≈ 13.666, so Δt <= 13 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 + 3 Δt => 30 <= 3 Δt => Δt >= 10.\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 13 inclusive.\n\nThus at T = t1 + Δt = 11 + Δt, so T=21,22,23,24? Δt=10,11,12,13.\n\nT=11+10=21, 22,23,24.\n\nBut we are at t=11 now, so future turns.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2: car (18,7,right,6)\n\nh=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 + 6 Δt, 18 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt] if 7+6Δt <= 0 <= 18+6Δt\n\nBut 7+6Δt <=0? 6Δt <= -7, impossible since Δt >=0, 7+6Δt >=7>0, so left end min 7, so 0 never in [7+6Δt,18+6Δt] since min x=7 at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly for all Δt, left end 7+6Δt >=7>0, so 0 never in span for y=2.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same as y=2, (18,7,right,6), same thing, min x=7>0, so never occupied at x=0.\n\ny=4: same, (18,7,right,6), never occupied.\n\nNow y=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), span [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\nMin at Δt=0 is 49>0, so never <=0, always >0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), span [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt]\n\nMin 1>0, so always >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=5, at all times, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly y=6: same cars as y=5, identical, so always safe.\n\ny=7: same, always safe.\n\nNow y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12), h=-36, τ=-47? (head h, tail τ) = (-36,-47), direction right, so Span = [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at Δt=0.\n\nAt T, [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt\n\nSo -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt => 12 Δt >=36 => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3.\n\nThus at T=11 + 3 =14, span [-47 + 36, -36 + 36] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car on y=8: (12,1,right,12), span [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt]\n\nMin 1>0, so never 0, always safe except? [1+12Δt,12+12Δt] >0 for all Δt, so 0 not in.\n\nSo only the first car causes issue at T=14 on y=8.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=8 at turn 14.\n\nIn the direct path, we would be on y=8 at t=14, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we can either not be on y=8 at t=14, or be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nSince we can wait or move slower.\n\nFor example, at some point, stay instead of moving up, so we delay.\n\nOr, go down first, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are always safe, as we saw, no car ever at x=0.\n\ny=5,6,7: all cars have min x>0, so always safe.\n\ny=8 has danger only at t=14.\n\ny=1 has danger at T=21,22,23,24, but since we are starting from y=5 and going up, we might not go to y=1, and T=21 is later, so probably not relevant if we can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nSimilarly other rows.\n\nSo the only danger is on y=8 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some turn, then move up to y=9.\n\nBut when on y=8, we must not be there at t=14.\n\nSo let's find when y=8 is safe.\n\nFor y=8, first car: span at T: [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span only when Δt=3, T=14, as above.\n\nOtherwise, for other Δt, not.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, T=13: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=4, T=15: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAnd second car always safe.\n\nSo y=8 is safe except at T=14.\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at any turn except 14.\n\nFor example, at T=13, or T=15, etc.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some turn T, then at turn T, action U, so at turn T+1, y=9.\n\nWe start at t=11, y=5.\n\nWe need to arrive at y=8 at some safe time.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are always safe, we can stay there or move.\n\nMinimal H: we can go directly but avoid t=14 on y=8.\n\nFor example, we can go up to y=6 or y=7 and wait, then go to y=8 at a different time.\n\nSince we need to be on y=8 at a time not 14.\n\nFor instance, at t=13, or t=15, etc.\n\nt=13: Δt=2, y=8 safe?

To be at y=8 at t=13, we need to arrive at y=8 at turn t=13.\n\ny_{13} =8.\n\nNow, y_{11} =5.\n\ny_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}\n\ny_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\nSet y_{13} =8.\n\ny_{12} can be 7,8, or 9, but since we start from 5, y_{12} between 4 and 6? y_{11}=5, Δy_{11} = -1,0,1, so y_{12} =4,5,6.\n\nThen y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}, so if y_{12}=4, y_{13}=3,4,5; if y_{12}=5, y_{13}=4,5,6; if y_{12}=6, y_{13}=5,6,7.\n\nNone can be 8, because from y_{12} <=6, y_{13} <=7 <8.\n\nTo have y_{13}=8, we need y_{12} to be 7 or 8, but y_{12} max is 6, as above.\n\ny_{11}=5, so y_{12} <=6.\n\nThus y_{13} <=7.\n\nCannot reach y=8 by t=13.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=8 at t=12: y_{12}=8.\n\ny_{11}=5, y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} <=6 <8, impossible.\n\nSo earliest possible to be at y=8 is t=14? y_{14}=8.\n\ny_{11}=5\n\ny_{12} =5 + Δy_{11}, so 4,5,6\n\ny_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}, so if y_{12}=4, y_{13}=3-5; y_{12}=5, y_{13}=4-6; y_{12}=6, y_{13}=5-7\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}, so if y_{13}=7, y_{14}=6,7,8; so can be 8 if y_{13}=7 and Δy_{13}=U.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{13}=6, y_{14}=5-7, not 8; y_{13}=5, y_{14}=4-6, not 8.\n\nSo only possible if y_{13}=7 and then U to y_{14}=8.\n\nBut at t=14, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we go slower, y_{14}=8 only if we were at y=7 at t=13 and up.\n\nBut at t=14, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be at y=8 at a different time, like t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=8 is safe.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=15.\n\ny_{15}=8.\n\nNow, from y_{11}=5, to y_{15}=8.\n\nIn 4 turns (t=11 to t=14 actions), we can increase y by at most 4, to 9.\n\ny_{15} = y_{11} + sum_{t=11 to 14} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{11}=5, y_{15} = 5 + sum of 4 deltas.\n\nEach delta in {-1,0,1}, so sum between -4 and 4.\n\ny_{15}=8, so 5 + sum =8, so sum=3.\n\nSo need net +3 from 4 actions.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=8 earlier but with stay, but earlier than t=14 not possible, as above.\n\nt=14 is possible but unsafe.\n\nSo t=15 is safe for y=8.\n\nNow, with 4 actions from t=11 to t=14, we go from position at t=11 to position at t=15.\n\ny_{15} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} + Δy_{14}\n\nSet y_{15}=8, y_{11}=5, so Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} + Δy_{14} =3\n\nEach in {-1,0,1}\n\nNow, during the path, we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nBut the only unsafe time is y=8 at t=14.\n\nNow, when are we on which row.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nFor t=11, on y_{11}, which is 5, safe.\n\nt=12, on y_{12}, which depends on actions.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to ensure that when on y=8, it is not at t=14.\n\nSince we reach y=8 at t=15, and at t=15 we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15, we are at y=8, then we can go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so at some turn, y_t=9.\n\nIf at t=15 we are at y=8, then at t=15 action U, to y=9 at t=16.\n\nThen y_{16}=9.\n\nH would be 5 actions: from t=11 to t=15 actions, then at t=16, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=5, turns from t=11 to t=15, 5 actions.\n\nSequence: actions a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, then at t=16, y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H} =9, t1=11, H=5, so t=16.\n\nNow, with sum of deltas =3 to go from 5 to 8 in 4 steps? y_{11}=5, after 4 actions, y_{15}= y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} + Δy_{14} =5 + sum_{t=11 to14} Δy_t\n\nSet this to 8, so sum_{t=11 to14} Δy_t =3.\n\nThen at t=15, we are at y=8, then action a_{15}=U, so y_{16}=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=8 at t=15, which is safe.\n\nIn between, we need to make sure that during the path, we don't have collision on other rows.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 are always safe, as established.\n\ny=8 at t=15 safe.\n\nNow, we need to have y_{15}=8, with sum of first four deltas =3.\n\nNow, the actions: we need to choose Δy_t such that we don't go out of bounds, but y between 0 and 9, starting from 5, going to 8, with net +3 in 4 moves, so possible, e.g., three ups and one stay, or other combinations.\n\nBut we also need to avoid being on y=8 at t=14, but since we are at y=8 at t=15, not t=14, so at t=14, we are not on y=8, so no problem.\n\nAt t=14, we are on some row, which should be safe.\n\ny_{14} depends.\n\ny_{14} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\nSince y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} =8\n\nAnd y_{14} between 0 and 9.\n\nSince y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}, and y_{15}=8, so if Δy_{14} = U, y_{14}=7; if S, y_{14}=8; if D, y_{14}=9.\n\nBut y_{15}=8, so:\n\nIf a_{14} = U, then y_{15} = y_{14} +1 =8, so y_{14}=7\n\nIf a_{14} = S, y_{15} = y_{14} =8\n\nIf a_{14} = D, y_{15} = y_{14} -1 =8, so y_{14}=9\n\nNow, at t=14, we are on row y_{14}.\n\nIf y_{14}=7, safe.\n\nIf y_{14}=8, but at t=14, y=8 is unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf y_{14}=9, but y=9 has no cars, safe.\n\nBut in the case where a_{14}=S, y_{14}=8 and y_{15}=8, but at t=14, on y=8, collision.\n\nIf a_{14}=D, y_{14}=9, then y_{15}=8, but y_{14}=9, safe, then to y_{15}=8, but we are going down, which is away from goal.\n\nBut possible, but inefficient.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=14 on y=8, we must not be on y=8 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, for the action at t=14, if we set a_{14} such that we are not on y=8.\n\nIn particular, when we have y_{15}=8, we must have a_{14} not S, because if S, y_{14}=8 and on y=8 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{14}=U, y_{14}=7, on y=7 at t=14, safe.\n\nIf a_{14}=D, y_{14}=9, on y=9 at t=14, safe.\n\nBut if a_{14}=D, y_{15}=8, which is fine, but then from y=9 down to y=8, which might not be efficient, but since we need to reach y=9 eventually, going down to 8 then up to 9 is extra.\n\nBetter to go directly.\n\nSo preferable to have a_{14}=U, so y_{14}=7, y_{15}=8.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=7, safe; at t=15, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, action U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nNow, with y_{15}=8, and y_{14}=7.\n\nNow, y_{14} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} =7\n\nSince y_{14}=7.\n\nAnd y_{11}=5, so Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} = 7 - 5 = 2? y_{14} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\ny_{11}=5, y_{14}=7, so sum_{t=11 to 13} Δy_t = 2\n\nThen y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} =7 +1 =8, if a_{14}=U.\n\nThen y_{16}=9.\n\nNow, we have three actions from t=11 to t=13 to increase y by 2, from 5 to 7 at t=14.\n\ny_{14}=7.\n\nAt t=11, on y=5.\n\nAfter a_{11}, y_{12} =5 + Δy_{11}\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13} =7\n\nNow, to have y_{14}=7, with y_{11}=5, so net +2 in three actions.\n\nPossible sequences: e.g., U,U,S or U,S,U or S,U,U, etc.\n\nWe need to check the positions during the turns.\n\nAt each turn, the row we are on must be safe.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 always safe, as long as we stay within, no issue with bounds since we are moving between 5 and 7.\n\ny min: if we go down, but we need net up, so probably no down moves.\n\nFor example, sequence: at t=11, action U, so y_{12} =6\n\nAt t=12, on y=6.\n\nThen action U, so y_{13} =7\n\nAt t=13, on y=7.\n\nThen action S, so y_{14} =7 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nThen at t=14, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen action a_{14}=U, so y_{15} =8\n\nAt t=15, on y=8, which is safe (t=15, Δt=4, [1,12], no 0)\n\nThen action a_{15}=U, to y_{16}=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nH=5 actions: a11 to a15.\n\nt1=11, actions from t=11 to t=15 (t=0 to H-1, H=5).\n\nIn the sequence: t=11: U, t=12: U, t=13: S, t=14: U, t=15: U\n\nThen y: t11:5, t12:6 (after U), t13:7 (after U), t14:7 (after S), t15:8 (after U), t16:9 (after U)\n\nAt turns: t11: on y=5, safe\n\nt12: on y=6, safe\n\nt13: on y=7, safe\n\nt14: on y=7, safe (action S, so same row)\n\nt15: on y=8, safe\n\nNo collision.\n\nWe could have other sequences, like at t13 action U instead of S, but let's see.\n\nIf at t13 action U, then y14=8, but at t14 on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIn this case, with y14=7, it's fine.\n\nTo save one action? But H=5 is minimal now since H=4 not possible.\n\nWith H=5, we reach at t16.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nEarlier than t16? To reach y=9 at t15?\n\ny_{15}=9.\n\nThen y_{11}=5, so need sum_{t=11 to14} Δy_t =4, so four U actions.\n\nBut then y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9.\n\nBut at t14, on y=8, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go faster, but cannot, since max one per step.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 by t15 without being on y=8 at t14.\n\nThus, minimal H=5, reaching at t16.\n\nWith the sequence above.\n\nBut we have a stay at t13, but it's fine.\n\nTo avoid stay, but not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we go up slower.\n\nFor example, at t11, S, stay at y=5, but then we delay, and still need to go up, might take more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr go down, but not helpful.\n\nSo the above seems efficient.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used one stay, but we can have all moves but with timing.\n\nAnother idea: be at y=8 at t=15 directly without stay.\n\ny15=8.\n\nWith sum of four deltas =3.\n\nFor example, actions: U,U,U,S or U,U,S,U etc.\n\nBut if U,U,U,S: then y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=8 (after S)\n\nBut at t14, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, U,U,S,U: y12=6, y13=7 (after U? actions: a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=S, y14=7; a14=U, y15=8)\n\nThen at t14, on y=7, safe; t15 on y=8, safe.\n\nSame as before, but in this case, at t13 we have S, but y14=7.\n\nIn this sequence: a11=U, a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, y15=8\n\nThen a15=U to y16=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we do S,U,U,U: a11=S, y12=5; a12=U, y13=6; a13=U, y14=7; a14=U, y15=8; then a15=U to y16=9.\n\nBut at t14, y14=7, safe, but we used one stay at t11, which delays us, still reach at t16.\n\nBut with the first action stay, we are slower in a way, but same number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at same time t16.\n\nWith a11=S, we start moving later.\n\nBut H is the same.\n\nBut in terms of actions, we have to take H actions.\n\nBut minimal H is 5, and we reach at t16.\n\nIn the sequence without initial stay, we have fewer \"wait\" but same H.\n\nBut in our case, with a11=U, a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U.\n\nWe can have a sequence with no stay if we go to y=8 at t=15 with different path, but since we need net +3 in 4 moves, must have three U and one S, or two U and one D and two U? Net +3, so three U and one S, or four U and one D but that would be net +3 only if one D, but with five actions? No.\n\nWith four actions: to have sum=3, must be three +1 and one 0, or other combos like two +1 and one +1 and one 0, etc., but must include a stay or equivalent.\n\nCannot have all U because that would be sum=4.\n\nSo must have one stay in the first four actions.\n\nThus, the sequence must include a stay or a down, but down would require extra up.\n\nSo most efficient is three up and one stay in the first four actions to reach y=8 at t=15, then up to y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list actions starting from t1=11.\n\nNow, in our sequence: actions at t=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nThen at t=16, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? We saw not, because to reach y=9 by t=15, we must have y=8 at t=14, which is unsafe.\n\nPerhaps reach y=9 from y=7 directly? No, must go through y=8.\n\nUnless we go to y=9 from another row, but no, adjacent only.\n\nSo no, H=4 impossible.\n\nThus H=5 minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=13, we have S, stay at y=7.\n\nBut we can choose when to stay.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we stay earlier.\n\nFor example, a11=S, stay at y=5, t=11.\n\nThen a12=U, to y=6 at t=12.\n\na13=U, to y=7 at t=13.\n\na14=U, to y=8 at t=14, but unsafe!\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=14, if we go to y=8, collision.\n\nSo we cannot do a14=U if at t=14 we are on y=7.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not go to y=8 at t=14.\n\nIn this case, with a11=S, we are at y=5 at t=11, then after a12=U, y=6 at t=12, on y=6; a13=U, y=7 at t=13, on y=7; then if a14=U, y=8 at t=14, on y=8, collision.\n\nIf at a14 we do S, then y=7 at t=14, safe, but then y=7, not 8.\n\nThen we need to go later.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=15, we can do a14=U to y=8 at t=15, but from y=7 at t=14, a14=U, y15=8.\n\nThen a15=U to y16=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut with initial stay, we have: a11=S, y12=5; a12=U, y13=6; a13=U, y14=7; a14=U, y15=8; a15=U, y16=9.\n\nAt t=14, on y=7, safe; t=15 on y=8, safe.\n\nBut we used a11=S, which is an extra action that doesn't progress, so it's worse in the sense that we have an action that doesn't move, but H is still 5, same number.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, same turn.\n\nBut we can avoid the stay by going up continuously but not to y=8 at t=14.\n\nBut since we must pass y=8, and t=14 is bad, we have to delay.\n\nThus, the sequence with a13=S is fine.\n\nTo have no stay, but we must have one less up or something, but net we need +4 to y, from 5 to 9, but with H=5 actions, we can have four ups and one down, but net +3, then to 8, then to 9, but that would require more actions or same.\n\nFor example, with H=5 actions: if we do four U and one D, net +3, y from 5 to 8, then to 9 with sixth action? Let's see.\n\nStart y11=5.\n\nAfter five actions, y16 = y11 + sum_{t=11 to15} Δy_t\n\nIf we want y16=9, then 5 + sum =9, sum=4.\n\nSo with five actions, we can have sum=4, e.g., four U and one S, or five U but then y=10>9 invalid, or three U and two S, etc.\n\nBut to reach faster, but we cannot reach before t16 with y=9.\n\ny16=9 is the earliest possible with H=5.\n\nWith actions, we can have sequences like U,U,U,U,S but at t15 y=9? Let's see.\n\nIf a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=U, y14=8; but at t14 on y=8 unsafe if we are there.\n\nIf a13=U, and at t13 on y=7, action U to y14=8, then at t14 on y=8, collision.\n\nThen if a14=S, y15=8, but at t14 collision already.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we do U,U,U,S,U: a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=S, y14=7; a14=U, y15=8; a15=U, y16=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nU,U,S,U,U: similar.\n\nTo have y16=9 directly with five ups, but y max 9, so if y11=5, a11=U to y12=6, ..., up to a14=U to y15=9? y15= y11 + Δy11+Δy12+Δy13+Δy14 =5 +4 if four U, to 9.\n\nThen at t15, y=9, which is the goal.\n\ny_{t1 + H} =9, with H actions from t=11 to t=11+H-1, then at t=11+H, y=9.\n\nFor H=4, we have actions at t=11,12,13,14, then at t=15, y=9.\n\nBut to have y15=9, need y11 + sum_{t=11 to14} Δy_t =9, so 5 + sum =9, sum=4, so four U actions.\n\nThen y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9.\n\nBut at t=14, we are on y=8, which has collision, as established.\n\nThus impossible for H=4.\n\nFor H=5, actions at t=11 to t=15, then at t=16, y=9.\n\nTo have y16=9, need sum_{t=11 to15} Δy_t =4.\n\nWith five actions, we can have four U and one S, or three U and two S, etc.\n\nBut with four U and one S, we can reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nFor example, sequence: a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S, a15=U.\n\nThen y: t11:5, after a11 U, y12=6; a12 U, y13=7; a13 U, y14=8; but at t14 on y=8, unsafe! Collision.\n\na13=U, to y14=8, at t14 on y=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we do a14=S, but when? If at t14 we do S, but we are on y=8 at t14.\n\nTo avoid being on y=8 at t=14.\n\nIn this sequence, if we have a13=S or something.\n\nSuppose a11=U, y12=6\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\nNow at t13, on y=7.\n\nIf a13=S, then y14=7, at t14 on y=7, safe.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=8, at t15 on y=8, safe (since t=15)\n\nThen a15=U, y16=9.\n\nBut with a13=S, we have a stay.\n\nIf we want to go to y=9 directly, but at t15.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t15.\n\ny15=9.\n\nThen need y_{15} = y_{11} + Δy_{11} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} + Δy_{14} =9\n\n5 + sum =9, sum=4, so four U in four actions? Actions from t=11 to t=14.\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14\n\nBut y15=9.\n\ny14 can be 8,9,10 but 10 invalid.\n\nIf y14=8, Δy14=U to y15=9\n\nIf y14=9, Δy14=S or D, but D to 8, not 9.\n\nTo y15=9, must have y14=8 and Δy14=U.\n\nNow, y14=8 must be at t=14, but at t=14, y=8 unsafe.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=9 at t=15 without being on y=8 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can reach y=9 is t=16, with H=5.\n\nAnd in the sequence, we need to have at t=14 not on y=8.\n\nSo, for example, with a13=S, we are at y=7 at t=14.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nOther sequences work as long as not on y=8 at t=14.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have: t11: U, t12: U, t13: S, t14: U, t15: U\n\nThen at t16, y=9.\n\nActions: Turn t_1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{t1+2} = S\n\nTurn t1+3: a_{t1+3} = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a_{t1+4} = U\n\nt1=11, so t=11,12,13,14,15.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nNow, but in the car state, we have y=1 with cars, but we never go there, so no issue.\n\nAlso, for completeness, at t=13, when we do S, we are on y=7, which is always safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence without stay, but not possible since we need to delay.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4 or something, but that would take more actions to come back.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nH=5.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=13, S, but we could do S at another time, but similar.\n\nTo make it faster, but cannot.\n\nAnother thought: can we be on y=8 at t=13? Earlier we saw impossible, since from y=5 at t=11, cannot reach y=8 by t=13.\n\nt=15 is the safe time.\n\nPerhaps at t=16, but later.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus, the action sequence.\n\nSo for turn t1=11:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9)\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from t=11 to t=15.\n\nH=5 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=15, Δt=4, span [ -47 + 48, -36 + 48] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nWe could have the stay at t=11 or t=12, but that might delay the upward move, but same H.\n\nFor example, if a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, then y12=5, y13=6, y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nAt t=14, on y=7, safe; t=15 on y=8, safe.\n\nBut we reached y=8 at t=15 same, but with initial stay.\n\nIn the previous, we had stay later, but both fine.\n\nI think the one with U,U,S,U,U is fine.\n\nNow, in the output.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, there is another car (12,1,right,12), but as we saw, it never covers 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo, I think this works.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 5, with the sequence of actions detailed below.\n\n### Analysis and Justification:\n- The only collision risk occurs on freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(T = 14\\) (i.e., \\(t_1 + 3\\)), where the car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\) has a span \\([-11, 0]\\), including \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are always safe at all turns, as no car on these rows covers \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe.\n- A direct path with four consecutive \"U\" actions (turns 11 to 14) would reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15 but requires being on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14, causing a collision.\n- To avoid this, the sequence includes a \"S\" (stay) action at turn 13 to delay arrival at \\(y = 8\\) until turn 15, which is safe (span \\([1, 12]\\) for the first car on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15, not including 0).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 11 (current turn, \\(y = 5\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12. Position at turn 11 is safe (\\(y = 5\\)).\n- **Turn 12 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13. Position at turn 12 is safe (\\(y = 6\\)).\n- **Turn 13 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Action \"S\" stays at \\(y = 7\\), so position at turn 14 is \\(y = 7\\). Position at turn 13 is safe (\\(y = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 14 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15. Position at turn 14 is safe (\\(y = 7\\), not \\(y = 8\\)).\n- **Turn 15 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. Position at turn 15 is safe (\\(y = 8\\) at turn 15: car spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([-47 + 12 \\times 4, -36 + 12 \\times 4] = [1, 12]\\), no collision).\n\nAfter these 5 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 16.\n\n### Answer Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 7) at turn t_1 = 13. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving only vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay). The grid has y from 0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars moving horizontally.\n\nThe key point is to avoid collisions. A collision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y (where y is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The player is on freeway y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nAlso, when moving, if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So, for example, if at turn T you are on y and you move to y+1, then at turn T, you are still on y, and at turn T+1, you are on y+1. So you only check collisions for the y you are currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=13, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn 13.\n\nFor freeway k=1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed s=3. Since direction is right, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so head is h, tail is τ, and since it's moving right, at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) — so head h=-24, tail τ=-35? But usually head should be greater if moving right? I think I have a confusion.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor a right-moving car, at t_1, head is at position h, tail at τ, and since it's moving right, we expect h > τ, so the span is [τ, h].\n\nBut here for freeway 1: head = -24, tail = -35. Since -24 > -35, yes, head is at -24, tail at -35, so span is [-35, -24] at t_1? No.\n\nIf head is h and tail is τ, and it's moving right, the span should be from min to max. But in this case, h = -24, τ = -35, so since -35 < -24, the tail is at -35, head at -24, so the car is from -35 to -24, which is to the left, but moving right? That doesn't make sense spatially.\n\nPerhaps I misread. The position: at t_1, for freeway 1, cars: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nNow, tail τ = -35, head h = -24. Since τ = -35 < h = -24, the car occupies from x= -35 to x= -24. And it's moving right with speed 3, so at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-35 + 3(T-13), -24 + 3(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (30, 19, right, 6) — head=30, tail=19, since 19<30, so at t_1, span [19,30], moving right.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (30,19,right,6) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (30,19,right,6) — same.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, since -47<-36, span [-47,-36] at t_1.\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, 25<36, span [25,36] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12) — yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same as above.\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, -23<-12, span [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nSecond car: same as before, [25,36] at t_1.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=7 at turn 13.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we start at y=7, we need to move up twice to reach y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on freeways y=7 and y=8 when we are on them.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are freeways with cars.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so when we reach y=9, we don't care about cars since y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSo, to reach (0,9), we just need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since x is always 0, we don't move horizontally.\n\nNow, from y=7, to get to y=9, we can go up twice: U then U.\n\nBut we need to make sure that when we are on y=7 and y=8, we don't collide with cars at position x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, if we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn T, at turn T we are still on y=7, so we only check for cars on y=7 at turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are on y=8, so we check for cars on y=8 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly for moving to y=9.\n\nSince we start at turn 13, position (0,7).\n\nLet me denote the turns: let t be the turn number, starting from t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=7.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=13,14,15,... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nSince t_1=13, let s = t - 13, so at s=0, y=7.\n\nThen at some s=H, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from s=0 to s=H-1, we have H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 13 + H - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf we start at turn t, after 0 actions, position at turn t.\n\nAfter 1 action, position at turn t+1, and so on.\n\nSo to be at position after H actions, it's at turn t + H.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is turn t_1 + H, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given before action? I think we need to take actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at time (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H, the position is updated, and we want that position to be (0,9).\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, the position is updated to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, after action a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at position (0, y_T), we need that for freeway y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince we start at T=13, y=7, so at T=13, we need to check if on freeway 7, 0 is not in car span at T=13.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns until we reach y=9.\n\nWhen we are at y=9, no need to check, since not a freeway.\n\nNow, first, let's check at turn 13, for y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt turn T=13, span for first car: since right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] but t_1=13, so T-t_1=0, so at T=13, it's the same as given.\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, so span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: τ=25, h=36, s=12, span [25,36]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-47,-36]? No, -36 to -47 is all negative, 0 not included.\n\nIs 0 in [25,36]? No, 25 to 36, all positive.\n\nSo at T=13, on freeway 7, no car at x=0, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, at turn 13, we can be there safely.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nWe can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since we want to go to y=9, moving up is better, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up.\n\nAction at t=13: U, then y_{14} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y=8.\n\nNow, we need to check for turn 14, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 14.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt turn T=14, t_1=13, so T-t_1=1.\n\nFirst car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, so at T=14, span [τ + s*1, h + s*1] = [-23 + 12, -12 + 12] = [-11, 0]\n\n-23 + 12 = -11, -12 + 12 = 0, so span [-11, 0]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-11, 0]? Yes, 0 is included, since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nThe span is inclusive, so x=0 is occupied by this car at turn 14.\n\nSecond car: τ=25, h=36, s=12, at T=14, [25 + 12, 36 + 12] = [37, 48], not including 0.\n\nBut the first car spans [-11,0], so at x=0, it is occupied at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, if we are on freeway 8 at turn 14, we would collide.\n\nSince we are at y=8 at turn 14, and freeway 8 has a car at x=0 at that turn, collision occurs.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=8 at turn 14 if we move up at turn 13.\n\nBut we are considering moving up at turn 13 to be at y=8 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, y=8, and freeway 8 has car at x=0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, moving up immediately to y=8 at turn 14 is not safe.\n\nWe could stay at y=7 or move down, but moving down might not be efficient.\n\nOr we could wait at y=7 for some turns until it is safe to move to y=8.\n\nSimilarly for moving to y=9.\n\nBut let's first see the car movements.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and from y=7, we need to pass through y=8 or go directly? No, we have to move step by step, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo we must go to y=8 before y=9, or stay, but eventually to y=9.\n\nWe can go from y=7 to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nOr stay at y=7 for some turns, then go to y=8, etc.\n\nBut minimal turns, so we want to go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay moving to y=8.\n\nPerhaps move at a different time when the car is not at x=0.\n\nNow, freeway 8 has that car that causes issue.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: first car (-12,-23,right,12) at t_1=13, span [-23,-12]\n\nAs time increases, it moves right, so span shifts right.\n\nAt time T, span [ -23 + 12(T-13), -12 + 12(T-13) ]\n\nWe need to find when 0 is in this span.\n\nThat is, when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nMin = -23 + 12(T-13)\n\nMax = -12 + 12(T-13)\n\nSo min <= 0 <= max iff\n\n-23 + 12(T-13) <= 0 <= -12 + 12(T-13)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12(T-13) <= 0 => 12(T-13) <= 23 => T-13 <= 23/12 = 1.916, so T-13 <= 1 since T integer? T-13 <= 1.916, so for T-13 = 0,1\n\nT-13 <= 1.916, so T-13 <= 1 since T integer? 23/12=1 and 11/12, so T-13 <= 1, i.e., T <= 14.\n\nT-13 <= floor(1.916) =1? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-23 + 12Δ <= 0 <= -12 + 12Δ, where Δ = T-13\n\nSo left: -23 + 12Δ <= 0 => 12Δ <= 23 => Δ <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δ <= 1 since Δ integer? Δ <= 1.916, so for integer Δ, Δ <= 1.\n\nΔ <= 1.916, so Δ=0,1\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= -12 + 12Δ => 12 <= 12Δ => Δ >= 1\n\nSo Δ >=1 and Δ <=1.916, so for integer Δ, Δ=1.\n\nThus at Δ=1, i.e., T=14, we have min <=0<=max, specifically min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nFor other Δ, not.\n\nFor Δ=0, T=13, min=-23, max=-12, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nΔ=1, T=14, min=-11, max=0, 0 in\n\nΔ=2, T=15, min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for Δ>2, further right.\n\nSo only at T=14, for this car, 0 is occupied.\n\nThe other car on freeway 8 is (36,25,right,12), at T=13, [25,36], at T=14, [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], not 0, and further away.\n\nSo only the first car causes a problem at T=14.\n\nTherefore, freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 14, specifically when Δ=1.\n\nAt other times, it should be safe.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, we need to see when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nAt time T, span [ -47 + 12Δ, -36 + 12Δ ] where Δ=T-13\n\n0 in span if -47 +12Δ <=0 <= -36 +12Δ\n\nLeft: -47+12Δ <=0 => 12Δ <=47 => Δ <=47/12≈3.916, so Δ<=3\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +12Δ => 36 <=12Δ => Δ >=3\n\nSo Δ >=3 and Δ <=3.916, so Δ=3\n\nAt Δ=3, T=16, min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [ -11,0], 0 occupied.\n\nSecond car: τ=25, h=36, s=12\n\n[25 +12Δ, 36+12Δ]\n\n0 in if 25+12Δ <=0 <=36+12Δ? But 25+12Δ >=25>0, so 0 <= min is false, so never 0 in, since min always positive for Δ>=0.\n\nAt T=13, min=25>0, so no.\n\nSo freeway 7 is unsafe only at T=16.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart at turn 13, y=7, safe as we saw.\n\nWe want to go to y=8 and then to y=9.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at turn 14.\n\nBut at other turns, it should be safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 13, y=8: but we are not at y=8 at turn 13, we are at y=7.\n\nAt turn 14, unsafe.\n\nAt turn 15: let's check freeway 8 at T=15.\n\nΔ=2, first car: min = -23 + 12*2 = -23+24=1, max= -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no.\n\nSo safe at T=15.\n\nAt turn 16: Δ=3, min=-23+36=13, max=-12+36=24, [13,24], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, always safe after.\n\nAt T=13: min=-23, max=-12, no.\n\nT=14: unsafe.\n\nT=15: safe.\n\nNow, similarly for y=7, unsafe at T=16, but at T=13,14,15 should be safe except T=16.\n\nAt T=13: we are safe, as before.\n\nT=14: if we stay, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=14, Δ=1, freeway 7 cars.\n\nFirst car: min=-47+12= -35, max=-36+12= -24, span [-35,-24], no 0.\n\nSecond car: min=25+12=37, max=36+12=48, no.\n\nSo at T=14, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nT=15: Δ=2, first car min=-47+24= -23, max=-36+24= -12, [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nSecond: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no.\n\nSafe.\n\nT=16: Δ=3, first car min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 occupied, unsafe.\n\nT=17: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe always, no cars.\n\nBut to get there, we need to be at y=8 at some turn, then move up.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn 13.\n\nWe can:\n\n- Move up at turn 13 to y=8 at turn 14, but at turn 14, y=8 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\n- Stay at turn 13, so at turn 14, still y=7.\n\nAt turn 14, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at turn 14, we can move up to y=8 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, we are at y=8.\n\nNow, at turn 15, freeway 8: as above, for T=15, Δ=2, span [1,12] for first car, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThen at turn 15, we can move up to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut we need to check if during the actions, we are safe at each turn.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 13: start at y=7.\n\nAction at turn 13: let's say S (stay), then y_{14} = y_13 + 0 = 7.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at y=7, freeway 7, which is safe at T=14.\n\nThen action at turn 14: U (up), then y_{15} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nAt turn 15, we are at y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=15 (span [1,12], no 0).\n\nThen action at turn 15: U, then y_{16} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 16, we are at y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reached at turn 16.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nWe took actions at turn 13,14,15? Three actions.\n\nActions: at t=13: S, t=14: U, t=15: U.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn t_1 + H = 13 + H = 16, so H=3.\n\nt_1 + H = 16, t_1=13, so H=3.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=13 to t=13+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1 + H = 16, so H=3.\n\nActions at t=13,14,15: S, U, U.\n\nThen y at t=16 is 9.\n\nNow, during turns:\n\nAt turn 13: position (0,7), freeway 7, safe.\n\nAt turn 14: position (0,7), freeway 7, safe.\n\nAt turn 15: position (0,8), freeway 8, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nWe could have moved earlier, but at turn 13, if we move up, we go to y=8 at turn 14, but unsafe.\n\nIf we move up at turn 13, we are at y=8 at turn 14, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWhat about moving down? Not efficient.\n\nOr staying multiple times.\n\nBut with this, H=3, we reach at turn 16.\n\nIs there a way with H=2?\n\nH=2 actions: actions at t=13 and t=14.\n\nThen position at t=15.\n\nAfter two actions, y at t=15.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nStart at y=7 at t=13.\n\nAfter first action, y at t=14.\n\nAfter second action, y at t=15.\n\nWe want y_15=9.\n\ny_15 can be 9 only if from y_14, we move up, so y_14 must be 8.\n\nThen at t=14, we must be at y=8 to move up to y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=14, we need to have moved from t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=7.\n\nIf we move up at t=13, then y_14=8.\n\nBut at turn 14, we are at y=8, which is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at t=13, but we start at y=7, not possible.\n\nSo only way to be at y=8 at t=14 is to move up at t=13.\n\nBut that causes collision at t=14.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 by t=15.\n\nWith H=2, we reach at t=15, but y=9 not possible.\n\nWith H=1: action at t=13, then y at t=14.\n\nTo have y_14=9, must move up from y_13=7, so y_14=8, not 9. Cannot reach y=9 in one action.\n\nSo minimal H is 3, with actions S at t=13, U at t=14, U at t=15.\n\nIn the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions from t_1.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nSo actions: at turn 13: S, turn 14: U, turn 15: U.\n\nThen at turn 16: y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=13, H=3, so actions at 13,14,15.\n\nNow, but we need to output for each turn.\n\nIn the car state, there are other freeways, but since we only go through y=7 and y=8, and we are at y=7 at t=13 and 14, y=8 at t=15, we don't care about other freeways.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any constraints from other freeways? For example, if we were to go to other y, but we don't, so no.\n\nIn this case, we stay on y=7 until moving up.\n\nBut at t=14, we are on y=7, which is safe.\n\nt=15 on y=8, safe.\n\nWe could consider moving earlier or later, but H=3 seems minimal.\n\nAnother possibility: what if we move down? But that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we move down to y=6, but then we have to come back, more actions, so worse.\n\nSo H=3 is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we used S at t=13.\n\nBut is there a way without staying?\n\nFor example, if we move up at a different time.\n\nBut at t=13, moving up leads to unsafe at t=14.\n\nWe have to stay or move down, but moving down is worse.\n\nSo S is necessary at t=13.\n\nPerhaps we can move up later, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=13, we stay, y=7.\n\nt=14, y=7.\n\nThen at t=14, instead of moving up, we stay again, but then we are still at y=7, and at t=16, y=7 is unsafe, so if we stay at t=14, at t=15 y=7, which is safe, but then at t=15 we can move up to y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, if we are on y=8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8 at t=16: Δ=3, span [13,24] as before, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, we move up to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut this takes more turns: actions at t=13:S, t=14:S, t=15:U, t=16:U, then y=9 at t=17, so H=4, worse than H=3.\n\nIf we move up at t=14 to y=8 at t=15, safe, then U at t=15 to y=9 at t=16, H=3 as before.\n\nIn the first plan, we moved at t=14 and t=15.\n\nAt t=13 we stayed.\n\nWe could do nothing at t=13, but that's stay.\n\nAnother thing: at t=13, if we move down to y=6, then we need to go up twice, but y=6 might have cars, and it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: cars (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), same as freeway 7? Freeway 6 has the same cars as 7? No.\n\nFreeway 6: from table, (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12), same as freeway 5,6,7? Freeway 5,6,7 all have the same cars: two cars each with those positions.\n\nBut freeway 6 is different row, but same car states? In the table, freeway 5,6,7 all have identical entries: both cars same.\n\nFreeway 8 has different.\n\nBut for y=6, at different times, it might be unsafe, but we don't need to go there.\n\nSimilarly, no point.\n\nSo the minimal H=3 with actions S, U, U at t=13,14,15.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to H actions.\n\nH=3, so three lines.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd that should do.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nPlayer position: at turn 13: (0,7)\n\nAction a_{13}: S, so y_{14} = 7 + 0 = 7\n\nAt turn 14: position (0,7), on freeway 7.\n\nCars on freeway 7 at turn 14: as above, first car: Δ=1, [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], not 0. Safe.\n\nAction a_{14}: U, so y_{15} = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nAt turn 15: position (0,8), on freeway 8.\n\nCars on freeway 8 at turn 15: Δ=2, first car [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], not 0. Safe.\n\nAction a_{15}: U, so y_{16} = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nAt turn 16: position (0,9), not a freeway, safe.\n\nReached in H=3 turns.\n\nIs there a way with H=2? As before, no.\n\nPerhaps we can move directly, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: what if we move up at turn 13, but to avoid collision at y=8 turn 14, but we can't, because the collision is at the position when we are there.\n\nUnless we move away, but we have to be at y=8 to go to y=9.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps at turn 14, if we are not on y=8, but we need to be.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=3 is minimal.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 1,2,3,4 have cars, but we don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: at t=13, [-35,-24], moving right, so at later times, but since we not on y=1, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nThe answer format.\n\nAlso, H is minimal, which is 3.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\end{array} } \n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t_1=13.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be clear.\n\nSince it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", here t=0: t_1 +0=13, a= S\n\nt=1: t_1+1=14, a=U\n\nt=2: t_1+2=15, a=U\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\(y = 7\\), which is safe because:\n  - Freeway 7 cars: \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\) and \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\).\n  - At turn 13 (\\(\\Delta = T - t_1 = 0\\)):\n    - First car span: \\([-47 + 12 \\cdot 0, -36 + 12 \\cdot 0] = [-47, -36]\\) (0 not in span).\n    - Second car span: \\([25 + 12 \\cdot 0, 36 + 12 \\cdot 0] = [25, 36]\\) (0 not in span).\n- Moving up immediately at turn 13 (action U) would place the player at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14. However, this is unsafe because:\n  - Freeway 8 cars: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\) and \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\).\n  - At turn 14 (\\(\\Delta = 1\\)):\n    - First car span: \\([-23 + 12 \\cdot 1, -12 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [-11, 0]\\) (0 in span, collision).\n- Staying at turn 13 (action S) keeps the player at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14, which is safe:\n  - At turn 14 (\\(\\Delta = 1\\)):\n    - Freeway 7 first car span: \\([-47 + 12 \\cdot 1, -36 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [-35, -24]\\) (0 not in span).\n    - Second car span: \\([25 + 12 \\cdot 1, 36 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [37, 48]\\) (0 not in span).\n- Then, moving up at turn 14 (action U) places the player at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15, which is safe:\n  - At turn 15 (\\(\\Delta = 2\\)):\n    - Freeway 8 first car span: \\([-23 + 12 \\cdot 2, -12 + 12 \\cdot 2] = [1, 12]\\) (0 not in span).\n    - Second car span: \\([25 + 12 \\cdot 2, 36 + 12 \\cdot 2] = [49, 60]\\) (0 not in span).\n- Finally, moving up at turn 15 (action U) places the player at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16, which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThis sequence (S at turn 13, U at turn 14, U at turn 15) achieves the goal in \\(H = 3\\) turns, reaching (0, 9) at turn 16. It is minimal because:\n- \\(H = 2\\) is impossible: Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 15 would require being at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14 (to move up), but \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turn 14.\n- \\(H = 1\\) is impossible: Moving up from \\(y = 7\\) reaches \\(y = 8\\), not \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids all other freeways (e.g., \\(y = 1\\) to \\(6\\)), so their car states are irrelevant.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 = 13\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15\\), with \\(H = 3\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is calculated based on the car's movement.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 quickly without colliding.\n\ny=9 is the target, and since it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), there are no cars on y=9, so once we reach y=9, we're safe. The goal is to be at (0,9), which might mean that on the turn we arrive at y=9, we should not be colliding, but since there are no cars, it should be fine.\n\nThe collision condition is only for freeways y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so it's safe to be there.\n\nCurrent position is y=8, which is a freeway, so we need to check if at turn t_1=15, being at y=8 causes a collision.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=15.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -18, tail -29, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says head h=-18, tail τ=-29, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut for right-moving cars, the head should be greater than tail, I think. Here head h=-18, tail τ=-29, since -18 > -29, so head is at -18, tail at -29, so the span is from τ to h, I assume? The span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly, but in the table, all directions are \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: head -18, tail -29, right, speed 3.\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] = [-29 + 3(T-15), -18 + 3(T-15)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this span at turn T when player is on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut for freeway 1, at T=15, span = [-29 + 3(0), -18 + 3(0)] = [-29, -18], which does not contain 0, so no collision at t_1 if on y=1.\n\nBut player is on y=8 at t_1.\n\nNow, player position: at turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in Span_k(T).\n\nSpan_k(T) for the cars on freeway k.\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 has two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for a given freeway k and turn T, we need to check for each car on that freeway if 0 is in its span at T.\n\nIf any car has 0 in span, then collision if player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 15, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt turn T=15, for first car: head h=12, tail τ=1, right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at T=15: [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] = [1 + 12(0), 12 + 12(0)] = [1,12]\n\n0 is not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, 0 is less.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=60, τ=49, span [49 + 0, 60 + 0] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=15, on y=8, no collision, good.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9. Since y=8 is current, to go to y=9, we need to move up, but we might need to wait or something if moving up causes issues, but since y=9 has no cars, once we are at y=9, we are done.\n\nBut to move to y=9, we need to be at y=8 and take action U at some turn, so that at the next turn, y=9.\n\nThe position after action: if at turn T, we are at y_T, we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWe reach (0,9) when y_{T} = 9 for some T.\n\nSince we start at turn 15, y=8.\n\nIf we take U at turn 15, then y_16 = 8 + 1 = 9, so at turn 16, we are at (0,9), and H=1? Turns: from t=15 to t=15+H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1, we start at position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8)\n\nWe take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H - 1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince y_{t_1} =8, we need to have a net change of +1 in y, so we must have one more U than D, but since we can only change by 1 each time, and we start at 8, to reach 9, we need exactly one U and no net down, but we can have S actions.\n\nThe minimal H should be 1: if we take U at turn 15, then y_16 = 9, so at turn 16, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut we need to check if during this, we avoid collisions.\n\nWhen we take action at turn T, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, when we are at y_T, we might collide if on freeway and 0 in car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and might collide if on freeway and 0 in span at T+1.\n\nIn this case, for H=1: we take action at turn 15, which could be U.\n\nAt turn 15, we are at y=8, which we checked, no collision at T=15 for y=8.\n\nThen we take U, so we move to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. So we are done in one turn.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me check the car on freeway 8 at turn 16.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 16: T=16, t_1=15, so T-t_1=1.\n\nCars: first car: (12,1,right,12), span at T=16: [τ + s(1), h + s(1)] = [1 + 12*1, 12 + 12*1] = [13,24]\n\n0 not in [13,24]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), span [49 +12, 60+12] = [61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue. But the player is at y=9 at turn 16, not on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 15, player on y=8, no collision.\n\nSo with one action U at turn 15, we reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut the sequence should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nWith H=1, we take action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, so y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nIf a_{t_1} = U, y_{16} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAnd no collision at turn 15 or 16.\n\nAt turn 16, y=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo minimal H should be 1.\n\nBut let me see if there is any problem.\n\nThe freeway 8 has cars, but at turn 15 and 16, 0 not in span, as above.\n\nBut let me check other freeways, but since player is only on y=8 at turn 15, and y=9 at turn 16, no other freeways involved.\n\nSo it seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem might be that at turn 15, when we take action, but collision is only based on position at each turn, not during movement, I think.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only on y_T at turn T.\n\nSo in this case, at turn 15, on y=8; at turn 16, on y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut why is there all this car information? Maybe for other paths, but since we can go directly to 9, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to check if at turn 15, on y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nMaybe for freeway 8, the cars might cover 0 at some point.\n\nBut at turn 15, span [1,12] and [49,60], no 0.\n\nAt turn 16, [13,24] and [61,72], no 0.\n\nAt turn 14? But we start at turn 15, so we don't care about before.\n\nSimilarly, turn 17: [1+12*2,12+12*2]=[25,36], etc., no 0.\n\nSo y=8 seems safe at all times? Not necessarily, but at least around turn 15.\n\nBut since we only care about turns when player is there.\n\nIn this case, with H=1, it works.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways; maybe the player has to move through other rows, but not necessary, since we are already at y=8, can go directly to y=9.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 has a problem.\n\nFreeway 8: first car head 12, tail 1, at T=15, [1,12], so x=0 is not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, 0 is outside.\n\nSimilarly, second car [49,60], far away.\n\nWhen does the first car cover x=0? When τ + s(T-15) <= 0 <= h + s(T-15)\n\nFor first car: [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT] where ΔT = T-15.\n\nSet 1 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 12 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 1 + 12ΔT <=0 implies ΔT <= -1/12, not possible since ΔT >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 12 + 12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0, but the inequality: 0 in [L,R] iff L <= 0 <= R.\n\nL = 1 + 12ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so L>0, so 0 < L <= something, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, for all ΔT>=0, L =1 +12ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for second car, L=49 +12ΔT >=49>0.\n\nSo on freeway 8, no car ever covers x=0 for T>=15? Is that right?\n\nHead and tail: for the first car, at T=15, tail at 1, head at 12, both positive, and moving right, so x increasing, so for T>15, x min is at least 1, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, second car starts at 49 to 60, even larger.\n\nSo freeway 8 is always safe for x=0? But the car is from 1 to 12, so x=0 is free, yes.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we don't care.\n\nSo why are there multiple cars? Perhaps for other starting positions.\n\nBut here, start at y=8, go to y=9, should be fine.\n\nBut the target is (0,9), and we reach it.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the action.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible.\n\nMaybe at turn 15, when we are at y=8, it is safe, but if we take S or D, we stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nBut with U, it should work.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that y=9 is not reached until turn 16, but we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and turn 16 is fine.\n\nThe minimal H is 1, with sequence: Turn 15: U\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nBut the answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 have cars that might be closer.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: cars (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head -12, tail -23, right, speed 12.\n\nAt T=15, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT]\n\nSet -23 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nFrom left: -23 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT=0,1\n\nFrom right: 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1, T=16, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, so 0 in [-11,0]? -11 to 0 inclusive, so yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt T=16, span for this car is [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1, T=16.\n\nBut this is for freeway 5.\n\nPlayer is not on freeway 5 at that time, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut for us, since we are only on y=8 and y=9, it doesn't affect.\n\nSo back to point, with one action U at turn 15, we go to y=9 at turn 16, no collision.\n\nBut why is freeway 8 listed with cars (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12), but as we saw, it doesn't cover x=0.\n\nIn freeway 8, first car tail 1, head 12, so at x=1 to 12, x=0 is free.\n\nSecond car 49-60, far.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\n\"8 | (12, 1, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12)\"\n\nYes.\n\nBut (12,1,right,12): is tail 1, head 12, so positions from 1 to 12.\n\nx=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y between 0 and 9.\n\nAt y=8, U to 9, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps at turn 15, on y=8, it is safe, but if we take U, we move immediately, but no issue.\n\nMaybe the car on freeway 8 at turn 16, but we are not there.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 9, but y=9 has no freeway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check the initial position: (0,8) at turn 15.\n\nCar on y=8 at turn 15: as above, no collision.\n\nAfter U, at turn 16, on y=9, no issue.\n\nSo minimal H=1.\n\nBut the problem has many cars listed, perhaps for other parts, but not needed.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that to go to y=9, but y=8 might be dangerous at some turns, but at turn 15 it's fine, and we leave immediately.\n\nSince we can act at turn 15, we can go up.\n\nPerhaps the action is taken, and position updated at end of turn or something, but from the description, at turn T, position is y_T, then action a_T, then y_{T+1} set.\n\nCollision checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nSo at turn T, if on freeway, and 0 in car span for that freeway at T.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15, y=8, freeway 8, cars: span [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nThen we take U, so at turn 16, y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nSo done.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, it is the goal, and no need to stay or anything.\n\nSo I think the answer is just one action: U at turn 15.\n\nBut let me see the answer format: it should be a sequence of actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nWith H=1, only one action: Turn 15: U\n\nThen in the box.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too short, and with all the car data, maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 8 has two cars, but as above.\n\nPerhaps the direction: all are right-moving, but for the car (12,1,right,12), at T=15, [1,12], x=0 not covered.\n\nAt T=16, [13,24], etc.\n\nBut let's see if x=0 is covered at any time.\n\nFor that car, L = 1 +12ΔT, which is at least 1, so always greater than 0, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nBut for freeway 5, at T=16, the car has span [-11,0], so x=0 covered on y=5 at T=16.\n\nBut player not there.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: car (-18,-29,right,3), span at T: [-29 +3ΔT, -18 +3ΔT]\n\nSet -29 +3ΔT <=0 <= -18 +3ΔT\n\nLeft: -29+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT<=29 => ΔT<=29/3≈9.666, so ΔT=0 to 9\n\nRight: 0 <= -18 +3ΔT => 3ΔT >=18 => ΔT>=6\n\nSo for ΔT from 6 to 9, T=21 to 24, x=0 covered on y=1.\n\nBut again, not relevant.\n\nSo for our case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player could start at other positions, but here start at (0,8).\n\nSo I think H=1 is correct.\n\nBut let me read the task again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\nWith H=1, it works.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" include the starting turn or not, but from the sequence, it starts from t_1.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, with freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,8) at t_1=15.\n\nTake U, to (0,9) at t_16.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the car (12,1,right,12): head 12, tail 1, but is the span inclusive? I think so, from tail to head.\n\nx=1 to x=12, so x=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I believe the minimal H is 1.\n\nSo the sequence is just one action.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: U }\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=15, so Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nWith a_{t_1} = U\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nPerhaps they want the action for that turn only.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 15, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Taking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 15 results in \\(y_{16} = 8 + 1 = 9\\). Thus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 16.\n\n### Collision Check:\n- At turn 15, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 15 are:\n  - Car 1: head = 12, tail = 1, direction = right, speed = 12. Span at \\(T = 15\\): \\([ \\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1) ] = [1 + 12(0), 12 + 12(0)] = [1, 12]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([1, 12]\\), no collision.\n  - Car 2: head = 60, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 12. Span at \\(T = 15\\): \\([49 + 12(0), 60 + 12(0)] = [49, 60]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([49, 60]\\), no collision.\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision is possible.\n\nTherefore, taking action \\(U\\) at turn 15 achieves the goal in \\(H = 1\\) turn with no collisions. No other sequence can achieve the goal in fewer turns, as \\(H = 1\\) is the minimum possible from the starting position.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 15: \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: U }",
