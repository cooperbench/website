It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with head direction left. So, the snake is just one segment long, meaning it's only the head. That makes sense because positions are given as a list, and here it's [(3,3)], so length 1.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, there's no body to worry about, so I can't collide with myself except possibly with the tail, but tail is the same as head right now. Also, since it's length 1, eating food will make it longer, so after eating, it will have a body.\n> \n> Current head direction is L (left), so from (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up to (3,4)), D (down to (3,2)), L (left to (2,3)), or R (right to (4,3)).\n> \n> But I can't move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on the next turn because that would be opposite. So for turn 0, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> After any move, the direction will change, so for subsequent turns, I need to consider the new direction.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, I have more freedom, but I need to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)\n> \n> (5,3) is close to the head at (3,3). Distance: from (3,3) to (5,3) is 2 units right, so I could go right then right again, but current direction is left, so I can't go right immediately because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> If I move right on turn 0, it would be opposite to current left, so I cannot do that. So for turn 0, options are U, D, L.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions for turn 0:\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - D: to (3,2)\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> Now, from there, I can plan ahead.\n> \n> I should consider which food to target. (5,3) is close, but to reach it, I need to go right, which I can't do immediately. I could go up or down first to change direction, then go right.\n> \n> For example, if I go up to (3,4), then from there I can go right to (4,4), then to (5,4), but (5,3) is at y=3, not y=4. From (5,4), I need to go down to (5,3), but let's see.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is at top-left, (3,3) to (1,1) is left and down, so I need to go left twice and down twice, but with direction constraints.\n> \n> (5,6) is up and right.\n> \n> But life span is 10 for all, so they have many turns, but I need to think about the path.\n> \n> Since the snake is length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But now tail is head, so it might not apply, or after eating, when there is a tail.\n> \n> Let's simulate possible sequences.\n> \n> First, let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

No, when I move, the head moves to new position, and since no body, tail follows, but since it was only head, after move, new head at (2,3), and no body, so positions become [(2,3)], direction L.\n> \n> Then I can move from there.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> After moving, the direction is the direction I just moved, for the next turn.\n> \n> For example, if I move L on turn 0, new position (2,3), new direction L.\n> \n> Then turn 1, I can move U, D, L (since not opposite to L, which would be R).\n> \n> Now, to reach (5,3), which is at (5,3), from (2,3), I need to go right to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (5,3). But (4,3) is empty? Let's see positions.\n> \n> After turn 0 L to (2,3), positions: [(2,3)]\n> \n> Turn 1, if I move R to (3,3), but (3,3) was the previous position, but since snake was only one segment, moving to (3,3) might be an issue? No, because the tail was at (3,3), but when I move head to (2,3), the tail moves away, so (3,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: when head moves to new cell, and if no food eaten, the tail is removed. But since length was 1, moving head to new cell, the old position is vacated, so (3,3) is free.\n> \n> So from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is possible, but direction: from (2,3) moving right to (3,3), so new direction R.\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3), then to (5,3) to eat food.\n> \n> But (4,3) might have something?

So if I eat food here, I grow, but since it's the first food, I'll become two cells long.\n> \n> I need to think about the initial move.\n> \n> Available actions: U, D, L, R. But I cannot instantly reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): but this is opposite to current U, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,4)\n> \n> Also, walls: borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each.\n> \n> (3,4) is inside.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which might affect later moves.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life 9\n> \n> - (5,3): value 1, life 9\n> \n> - (5,6): value 1, life 9\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life 10, but under snake head.\n> \n> Since food is under the head, I cannot eat it immediately because the body hasn't moved away. To eat it, I need to move away, then come back when the food is still there.\n> \n> Life span: food disappears after N turns, including current. So at turn 1, life_span decreases.\n> \n> For food at (3,4), life_span 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 1, for a food with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn L, I think. Countdown decreases every turn, including when it spawns.\n> \n> In this case, all food has life_span 9 or 10 at turn 1.\n> \n> For (3,4): life_span 10, so countdown is 10 at turn 1. After turn 1, countdown 9, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 1 to turn 10, but only if head moves on it after body has moved away.\n> \n> Similarly for others: (1,1) life 9, disappears after turn 9? Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 1, countdown=9, after turn 1, countdown=8, ..., after turn 9, countdown=0, disappears before turn 10? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is N at turn T, it disappears at the end of turn T + N - 1 or something? Let's define.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn T, for a food with life_span S, it has S turns left including the current turn. After the turn, S decreases by 1. If S was 1, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 1, food with life_span 10: it is present during turn 1, and countdown decreases to 9 after turn 1. It can be eaten during turn 1 to turn 10, but after turn 10, countdown 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 9 at turn 1: can be eaten from turn 1 to turn 9, disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (1,1): life_span 9 at turn 1, so available turns 1 to 9\n> \n> - (5,3): life_span 9, turns 1-9\n> \n> - (5,6): life_span 9, turns 1-9\n> \n> - (3,4): life_span 10, turns 1-10\n> \n> But (3,4) is under snake, so I need to move away first.\n> \n> Now, snake is only one cell, so no body yet. After I eat the first food, I'll have a body.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> Since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence for turn 1 to at least turn 6 or so.\n> \n> First, at turn 1, I need to choose a move.\n> \n> Current position: (3,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4). D is invalid.\n> \n> Now, what about walls? Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant now.\n> \n> (3,5): y=5, which is within 0 to 7, not a border wall. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacle at (5,2), cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,5) is fine, (2,4) x=2>0, y=4, fine, (4,4) x=4<7, y=4, fine.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,4) is under me, but I can't eat it now because I'm on it. To eat it, I need to move away and come back later.\n> \n> Since I'm only one cell, if I move away, the food is exposed, and I can come back to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see the Tail Reward Danger. Not applicable yet, since no tail.\n> \n> I should consider going towards other food or staying near to eat this one.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) has longer life (10 turns) compared to others (9 turns), so I have time.\n> \n> Others have only 9 turns, so I might prioritize them if they are at risk of disappearing.\n> \n> But all have multiple turns, so I can plan.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), I assume.\n> \n> Walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid has cells from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but the border cells are walls, so snake cannot move to those coordinates. Internal cells are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2) is a wall.\n> \n> So snake can be on (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2).\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (5,2) is a wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now positions:\n> \n> Snake head at (3,4)\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4) under head.\n> \n> (3,4) under head, so not accessible for eating until I move away.\n> \n> At turn 1, I need to move.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): then head at (3,5), snake position [(3,5)] since only one segment. After move, tail moves to new position, but since length 1, after move, it's at the new cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: after each move, the head moves to new cell, and if no food eaten, tail is removed, but since length 1, moving to new cell means the old position is empty.\n> \n> Then, food at (3,4) is now exposed, since body moved away.\n> \n> Then, I could potentially move back to (3,4) to eat it later.\n> \n> But I need to consider direction.\n> \n> Current direction U, after move U to (3,5), direction becomes U.\n> \n> Then at turn 2, I can move U, D, L, R, but D would be down to (3,4), which is reverse?

Since it's a single segment, moving right from (4,4).\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y. But walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls occupy those cells, so snake cannot be at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, with borders walls, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction R, so it's moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L would be opposite direction, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So from (4,4), moving right would go to (5,4), but is (5,4) available?\n> \n> Check obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but (5,4) is different. Walls are at borders, so (5,4) should be free, but let's list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked cells: border walls, so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So for (5,4): x=5, y=4, not on border, and not (5,2), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Now, food is at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is food, and snake is at (4,4), so (3,4) is left of head.\n> \n> But head is at (4,4) moving right.\n> \n> Since snake is only one segment, no body, so no collision issues except walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, since no body, the \"tail reward danger\" doesn't apply because there is no tail adjacent; tail is the head itself, but it's a single point.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n> \n> But here, tail is part of the snake; in this case, since only head, tail is the same as head, but when it moves, it will grow if it eats food.\n> \n> Current state: snake positions: [(4,4)], so head at (4,4), and since length 1, tail is also at (4,4).\n> \n> But when it moves, if it eats food, it will grow, so after eating, length becomes 2.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells: from (4,4), adjacent are (4,5) up, (4,3) down, (3,4) left, (5,4) right.\n> \n> (3,4) has food, value 1.\n> \n> If I move left to (3,4), I eat the food, then since value positive, length increases by 1, so snake becomes [(3,4), (4,4)]? When snake moves to a new cell, if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the new head is at that cell, and the tail stays, so length increases by one. If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next, so length same.\n> \n> Here, since no body, moving to (3,4) which has food, so after move, snake will be at [(3,4), (4,4)], with head at (3,4), and tail at (4,4). Direction would be L, since moved left.\n> \n> Similarly, if move to other cells.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (3,4) has life span 9, so it will disappear at turn 2 + 9 = turn 11. Since turn 2 now, after move to turn 3, life span decreases to 8, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods have life span 8, so disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Now, possible actions at turn 2: I can move U, D, R, or L? But direction is R, so I cannot move L, because L is opposite to R.\n> \n> Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n> \n> Current direction R, so moving opposite would be L, which is not allowed. So I can only move U, D, or R. Cannot move left.\n> \n> So from (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,5)\n> \n> - D: to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,4)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are free:\n> \n> (4,5): x=4,y=5, not border (since border y=0,7, x=0,7), and not obstacle (5,2), so free.\n> \n> (4,3): similarly, free.\n> \n> (5,4): free, as before.\n> \n> Now, food: (4,5) has no food, (4,3) has no food, (5,4) has no food. Food is at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4). (3,4) is left, but I cannot move left directly because of no reverse.\n> \n> (5,3) is at y=3, x=5, so from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), then to (5,3) later, etc.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since snake is small, eating food is good to grow, but I need to survive.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are walls. Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is at y=2, which is within 1 to 6, so blocked.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is close to head at (4,4), but I cannot move directly to it because I can only move U, D, R, not L.\n> \n> So to reach (3,4), I need to go around, but that might take time, and it has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider possible paths to eat food without dying.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so I need to avoid self-collision later.\n> \n> Currently, length 1, no issue.\n> \n> Let's evaluate the three possible moves at turn 2.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (5,4)\n> \n> Then at (5,4), no food. Direction R.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), but L is opposite to R, so cannot move L. Can move U, D, R.\n> \n> R to (6,4), but (6,4) is not wall? x=6, y=4, not border, since border x=7 is wall, x=6 is ok. Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free except obstacles. (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,4) is fine.\n> \n> So from (5,4), move to:\n> \n> - U: (5,5)\n> \n> - D: (5,3) — and (5,3) has food!\n> \n> - R: (6,4)\n> \n> If I move D to (5,3), I eat the food at (5,3), since it has value 1, so snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (5,3), body at (5,4)? When I move to (5,3), head is now (5,3), and since I ate, tail stays at previous position, but previous was (4,4) or (5,4)?\n> \n> At turn 2, snake at (4,4), move R to (5,4) at turn 3. No food at (5,4), so snake moves to (5,4), and since no eat, tail moves off, but since only one segment, after move, snake is at [(5,4)], length 1, direction R.\n> \n> Then at turn 3, from (5,4), move D to (5,3), which has food, so eat it, snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)], head at (5,3), tail at (5,4), direction D.\n> \n> Life span of that food was 8 at turn 2, at turn 3 it decreases to 7, but since eaten at turn 3, it's consumed.\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to continue.\n> \n> But let's see other options.\n> \n> Option 2: Move U to (4,5) at turn 2.\n> \n> Then at (4,5), no food, so snake at [(4,5)], direction U? Move U, so direction up.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), but D is opposite to U? U is up, D is down, opposite, so cannot move D. Can move U, L, R.\n> \n> L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n> \n> No food near, except (5,6) or others, but not immediate.\n> \n> (5,6) is food, at (5,6).\n> \n> From (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat, but let's sequence.\n> \n> Turn 2: move U to (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 3: from (4,5), can move R to (5,5) (since direction U, moving R is not opposite, so ok)\n> \n> At (5,5), no food? Food is at (5,6), so not eaten.\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (5,5), direction R? Last move was to (5,5) from (4,5), so moved right, so direction R.\n> \n> Then can move U to (5,6), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> Life span of (5,6) is 8 at turn 2, at turn 4 it would be 6, still there.\n> \n> So eat at turn 4.\n> \n> Similarly, option 3: move D to (4,3) at turn 2.\n> \n> Then at (4,3), no food, snake at [(4,3)], direction D.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3). Cannot move U, since opposite to D.\n> \n> (5,3) has food, so if move R to (5,3), eat it at turn 3.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) might be ok, but y=2, not wall.\n> \n> Now, back to the food at (3,4). It's close, but I cannot reach it directly. To eat it, I need to move in a way that I can approach it later.\n> \n> For example, if I move up or down first, then I can go left.\n> \n> But (3,4) has life span 9, so it will be there until turn 11, so I have time.\n> \n> But I need to eat food to score, so I should aim for the closest or safest.\n> \n> Also, after eating, I grow, so I need space to move without trapping myself.\n> \n> Now, the grid has an obstacle at (5,2), which might block some paths.\n> \n> Let's list the food positions relative to head:\n> \n> - (3,4): left, distance 1, but cannot go directly\n> \n> - (5,3): down-right, distance |5-4| + |3-4| =1+1=2, can reach in 2 moves if I go right then down, or down then right, but with constraints.\n> \n> From (4,4), if I move D to (4,3), then R to (5,3), eat at turn 3.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,4), then D to (5,3), eat at turn 3 as well.\n> \n> (5,6) is at (5,6), from (4,4), move U to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then U to (5,6), eat at turn 4.\n> \n> (1,1) is far, at (1,1), which is top-left, while head at (4,4), so distance |1-4| + |1-4| =3+3=6, so at least 6 moves away, but with obstacles, might be more.\n> \n> Life span 8, so if I start moving towards it, I might reach by turn 8 or so, but need to plan.\n> \n> But since I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan sequences.\n> \n> First, I should consider the immediate food at (5,3) or (3,4), but (3,4) not reachable directly.\n> \n> Another thing: since (3,4) has food, and snake is at (4,4), if I move away, and later come back, I can eat it when head moves onto it.\n> \n> But to do that, I need to have the body not there, but currently no body, so if I move to, say, (5,4), then (4,4) is empty, but (3,4) has food, so I can move to (3,4) later, but from where?\n> \n> For example, if I move to (5,4), then to (5,3) or something, then I can go back to (4,4), but (4,4) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> Let's think of a sequence to eat (3,4).\n> \n> At turn 2, I move, say, U to (4,5). Then snake at (4,5), direction U.\n> \n> Turn 3: from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) (since not opposite, U to L is allowed? Directions: moving L is left, which is perpendicular, not opposite. Opposite only if directly opposite, like U and D, L and R.\n> \n> So from direction U, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> So move L to (3,5).\n> \n> At (3,5), no food? Food at (3,4) is below.\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (3,5), direction L (since moved left), so can move L, U, D, not R.\n> \n> D to (3,4), which has food, so eat at turn 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D first at turn 2 to (4,3), then at turn 3 move L to (3,3), then turn 4 move U to (3,4) to eat.\n> \n> Or other ways.\n> \n> But eating at turn 4.\n> \n> Whereas (5,3) I can eat at turn 3 if I move towards it.\n> \n> Now, (5,6) eat at turn 4 as above.\n> \n> (1,1) too far for now.\n> \n> But all foods have same value, so I should eat the one that is safest and allows future moves.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the obstacle at (5,2). It might make the bottom-right area a bit tight, but not immediately.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> For example, if I eat (5,3), snake at (5,3) and (5,4), head at (5,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: since direction D, can move D, L, R, not U.\n> \n> D to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle!

Moved from (4,3) to (4,4), which is up, so direction U.\n> \n> Then can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, cannot move there, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but (5,4) might be free.\n> \n> (4,3) is body part, so if move D to (4,3), collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) has food, so move L to (3,4), eat it.\n> \n> At turn 5, eat (3,4).\n> \n> Life span was 9 at turn 2, at turn 5 it would be 9 - (5-2) = 9-3=6?

It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable, but there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment? [(4,3)]. That means the snake has only a head, no body yet. Because it says \"head first, body segments follow\", but here there's only one position, so the snake length is 1.

Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, it's just the head. When it eats food, it will grow, so after eating, length becomes 2.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3), direction is down. So from (4,3), moving down would go to (4,2), but let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,2) should be within bounds? y=0 is wall, so y=2 is above y=0, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom; I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U increases y, that means y increases upwards or downwards? Conventionally in such games, y=0 might be top, and increasing y goes down, or vice versa.\n> \n> Let's see: U: (x,y+1) — so if y+1, it might mean moving up if y=0 is bottom, or down if y=0 is top.

Since walls are at y=0 and y=7, and moving down decreases y (D: (x,y-1)), so if y decreases, and y=0 is a wall, that means y=0 is the bottom row, so decreasing y moves towards lower rows, which might be down if we think of the grid with (0,0) at bottom-left or top-left.\n> \n> Typically in programming, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, so U (y+1) would be down?

So valid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: border cells are occupied by walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 inclusive? For example, (1,1) is a food position, so it must be playable. Similarly, (5,6) is food, y=6, and wall at y=7, so y=6 should be playable, since wall is y=7.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So grid cells: (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake at (4,3), only head.\n> \n> Head direction D (down), which is (x,y-1).\n> \n> Now, since no body, no collision risk except walls or obstacle.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn.\n> \n> Now, possible actions from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) — y+1, so from (4,3) to (4,4)\n> \n> - D: to (4,2) — y-1, to (4,2)\n> \n> - L: to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,3)\n> \n> But (5,3) has food, and it's within bounds.\n> \n> (4,2): y=2, which is above y=1, and y=0 is wall, so y=2 is valid. But there's obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) should be free, unless occupied.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3), which is adjacent right.\n> \n> Also, (3,4) is left and up? (3,4) from (4,3) is left to (3,3) then up?

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N turns including t, so it disappears after turn t + N -1 or something.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food at turn t with life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 3, life span 7, so it appears at turn 3, and will be there until turn 3+6=9? Let's see: countdown starts at L, decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown = L, so after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it has countdown L at turn t, L-1 at t+1, ..., 1 at t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Here, at turn 3:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 7, so countdown 7 at turn 3, will disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 7, disappear at turn 10\n> \n> - (5,6): life span 7, disappear at turn 10\n> \n> - (3,4): life span 8, disappear at turn 11\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,3), and (5,3) has food. If I move right to (5,3), I eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> Then, since it's positive food, value +1, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, snake will have two segments: head at (5,3) and tail at (4,3)? When snake eats, it grows, so the new head is at food position, and tail remains until next move, but since it was moving, the body grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,3), if I move to (5,3), I eat the food, so new position: head at (5,3), and since it grew, the tail is still at (4,3), so snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3)].\n> \n> Then next turn, when I move, the tail moves, etc.\n> \n> But here, since snake had only one segment, after eating, it will have two segments.\n> \n> Now, head direction: after moving to (5,3), if I moved right, new direction is R.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> There is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,3), head at (5,3), they are adjacent, but the food was at (5,3), which head ate, so tail is at (4,3), no food there. The danger is only if the tail segment itself has food on it that you eat by moving to it, but since tail moves, it's different.\n> \n> The rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (5,3), tail is at (4,3), no food on tail cell. So no issue.\n> \n> But if the tail had food on it, and I move to it, it might be a problem, but here no.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,4) is at (3,4), which is from (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), or up to (4,4) then left to (3,4), etc.\n> \n> But (5,3) is immediate.\n> \n> Also, (5,6) is at y=6, which is top row if y=6 is high.\n> \n> Since y from 1 to 6, and U increases y, so y=6 is the top row, y=1 is bottom row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Head at (4,3), y=3, so middle vertically.\n> \n> Now, I need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks and think long-term.\n> \n> First, immediate options:\n> \n> - Move R to (5,3): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Then, from there, possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), but (4,3) is the tail, so if I move left, to (4,3), which is the tail, but in snake, when you move, the tail moves first, so head moves to new position, and tail follows.\n> \n> Specifically: when snake moves, head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> So if snake is [(5,3), (4,3)] and I move left to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently occupied by tail. At the moment of move, head moves to (4,3), which is where tail is, but since tail will move to the previous head position? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard collision: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body except the tail, it collides. But the tail cell is special because the tail moves away simultaneously, so if head moves to the tail cell, it is safe because the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> In this case, with snake at positions: head at (5,3), tail at (4,3). If I move left to (4,3), head moves to (4,3), but at that instant, tail is still at (4,3), so head and tail are on same cell, which is collision? But in standard rules, since tail moves to where head was, it should be ok, but the cell is occupied during the move.\n> \n> I need to clarify the collision rule.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So yes, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, here, if I move to (4,3), it is the tail, so no collision.\n> \n> Then snake becomes head at (4,3), tail at (5,3)? After moving left: head was at (5,3), moves to (4,3), tail was at (4,3), moves to where head was, which is (5,3), so now snake is [(4,3), (5,3)]? Positions: after move, head at new position, body segments follow.\n> \n> Initial: positions list: head (5,3), body (4,3)\n> \n> After move L: head moves to (4,3), then the body segment (which was tail) moves to the previous head position (5,3).

New head position: (4,3). But (4,3) was occupied by tail, so now it's the head.

The tail was at (4,3), so we remove it, meaning that cell is now only head, and no tail segment, so snake is just [(4,3)] with length 1.

So after removal, the snake positions are: new head at (4,3), and the old tail is removed, so no other segments. Thus, the snake now has only one segment at (4,3). But that means the snake length decreased from 2 to 1, which is incorrect; it should remain length 2.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, when it moves without eating, it should still have length L, with the head moving to a new cell and the tail moving off the old position.\n> \n> In this case, moving to the tail cell: the new head position is the old tail position, and the tail is removed, so the snake has one fewer segment. That can't be right.\n> \n> I think for a snake of length 2, moving to the tail cell is allowed and results in the snake occupying only that cell with length 1, but that seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps in this implementation, when moving to the tail cell, it is not considered collision because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for a two-segment snake, moving to the tail position: after the move, the head is at the previous tail position, and since the tail is removed, there is no body, so no collision. The snake effectively has length 1 now, but the rules don't specify that the length changes only when eating; when not eating, the tail moves, so length stays the same, but the positions shift.\n> \n> Let's read the rules carefully.\n> \n> \"Snake Positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] (head first, body segments follow)\"\n> \n> \"when the head moves to a new cell, if it is food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the head position.

Since (4,3) is not food (no food there), the tail is removed. The tail was at (4,3), so it is removed, and the new snake positions are [ (4,3) ], so only one segment, length 1.\n> \n> But that means the snake shortened, which is not typical. I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps for a two-segment snake, the body is only one segment, so when head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail position is vacated, and the new head is at new position, and the body segment moves to the old head position.\n> \n> Initial: head (5,3), body (4,3) which is also the tail.\n> \n> Move head to (4,3): new head position (4,3).

It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (5,4), body at (5,3). So it's a short snake, only two segments long. The head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (5,4) from (5,3). Since it moved up, the previous position was below, so from (5,3) to (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span as given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn 5, for the food with life span 5, it will disappear after 5 turns? Let me clarify the life span mechanic.\n> \n> It says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, it appears and the countdown starts from N down to 0. When the countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something? The countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn.\n> \n> In the input, at turn t, for each food, life_span is given, meaning it has that many turns left before disappearing. For example, food at (1,1) has life span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, when we are given the state, the life_span is the number of turns remaining. After each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, the food disappears.\n> \n> For (1,1): life span 5 at turn 5. After turn 5, it becomes 4; after turn 6, it becomes 3; ... after turn 9, it becomes 0, and disappears at the end of turn 9 or before turn 10? Typically, it disappears when life span reaches 0, so at the start of turn when life span is 0, it's gone.\n> \n> The state is given at the beginning of turn t. So at turn t=5, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left: it will be present on turns 5,6,7,8, and disappear before turn 9. After turn 5, life span decreases to 4 for turn 6, and so on, until after turn 8, life span is 1, then after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 5, present until turn 9 (since turns 5,6,7,8,9? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 5, life span=5, meaning 5 turns including this one? I think it's better to think: at turn t, life_span = L, so it will last for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is L at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive. Then at turn t + L, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,1): L=5 at t=5, exists turns 5 to 9 (5 turns: 5,6,7,8,9)\n> \n> After turn 5, L=4 for turn 6, etc.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (5,6): L=5 at t=5, exists turns 5-9\n> \n> - (3,4): L=6 at t=5, exists turns 5-10\n> \n> - (5,1): L=9 at t=5, exists turns 5-13\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next turn, because that would be opposite. So possible moves: U, L, R. D is invalid.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collision.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So grid:\n> \n> - x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> - Walls at all (0,y), (7,y) for y=0 to 7, and (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to 7? No, it says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal (5,2).\n> \n> So cells like (1,1) is not wall, etc.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3). So the tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> If I move, the tail will move away only if I eat food; otherwise, when I move, the tail follows.\n> \n> Since snake length is 2, if I eat food, length becomes 3, so tail stays or something? Let's see.\n> \n> When I eat food, length increases by 1 for positive food. So if I eat, after moving, the new tail is added, so the body grows.\n> \n> But in terms of position, when I move the head to a new cell, if that cell has food, I eat it, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows. If no food, tail moves to the previous position.\n> \n> But in this case, with only two segments, moving head to new cell:\n> \n> - If eat food, head moves to new cell, body stays, so new segment added, snake becomes head, old head, tail? Positions: after move, if eat, head to new position, the body segment remains, so snake becomes [new head, previous head, previous body] but since only one body, it adds a segment.\n> \n> Start: positions [(5,4), (5,3)] head at (5,4), tail at (5,3)\n> \n> If I move head to, say, (5,5), and if there is food there, I eat it, so new positions: head at (5,5), and tail stays at (5,3), so snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] length 3.\n> \n> If no food, head to (5,5), tail moves from (5,3) to where? When no eat, tail moves to the previous second segment position, but since only two, after move, head to new position, the tail moves to the previous head position? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell. If ate food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one cell. If didn't eat, the tail moves off its current position.\n> \n> So for this snake: positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has food, snake becomes [C, A, B] — head C, then A, then B.\n> \n> - If no food, snake becomes [C, A] — head C, and A is now the tail; B is removed.\n> \n> In the no food case, the tail B is removed, so positions are [C, A].\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> But currently, no food under snake, I think. Snake at (5,4) and (5,3), food at (1,1), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1). (3,4) is at y=4, x=3, snake head at (5,4), so not same cell. (5,1) is different. So no food under snake now.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail has food only if food is on the tail cell. Currently, no food on tail, so not an issue yet.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,4) direction U:\n> \n> - U (up) to (5,5)\n> \n> - D (down) but invalid, reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - L (left) to (4,4)\n> \n> - R (right) to (6,4)\n> \n> Now, check for walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, (5,5): is it wall? Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7 walls. (5,5) x=5 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, so not border. Internal obstacles: only (5,2), so (5,5) is empty. But is there food? Food at (5,6), (1,1), etc., not at (5,5). (5,6) is above, but (5,5) no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): not wall, not border, internal obstacles only (5,2), so empty. Food? (3,4) is at (3,4), so (4,4) no food.\n> \n> (6,4): similarly, not wall, empty, no food.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,5), what happens? No food there, so after move, head to (5,5), tail moves to (5,4)? Positions: before move: [(5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> After move U to (5,5): since no food at (5,5), tail moves, so new positions: head (5,5), and the body (5,4) becomes tail? Since only two segments, after move, no eat, so snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4)] — head at (5,5), tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (4,4): new positions [(4,4), (5,4)] head (4,4), tail (5,4)\n> \n> If move R to (6,4): [(6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 9\n> \n> - (5,6): value 1, life span 5, by turn 9\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 6, by turn 10\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 9, by turn 13\n> \n> Since life span is long for some, I don't need to rush all immediately.\n> \n> But I should plan a path to eat as many as possible while avoiding dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6?

Since it's turn 7, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so at turn 10 (7+3=10, but life span decreases each turn including current, so it has 3 turns left including turn 7? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's present for N turns starting from when it was spawned. But here, we're given the current life span.\n> \n> For (1,1): life span 3 at turn 7. That means it was spawned at some turn, and has 3 turns left including turn 7.

Turn 7 now, need to eat by turn 9, so in 2 or 3 moves? From (5,6) to (1,1), min moves 4+5=9, which is more than 3 moves (turns 7,8,9), so impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 9.

No, moves are to adjacent cells, so from (4,6) to (1,1) in two moves: max change 2 in x and 2 in y, but |4-1|=3, |6-1|=5, so even in two moves, best is to reduce x by 2 to 2, y by 2 to 4, to (2,4), not (1,1).

No, the walls are the borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, meaning they are out of bounds. So the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but the border cells (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) are walls, so the snake can move on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Not necessarily; the internal area might be larger, but with walls at the edges. For example, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is accessible; similarly y from 1 to 6. But there's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So the accessible cells are all (x,y) where 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except for (5,2) which is an obstacle.\n> \n> Now, current turn t=8.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then body at (5,6), then tail at (5,5).

Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, if life span is K, after this turn, it becomes K-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something.\n> \n> But in the input, for food, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the current remaining life span at turn t.\n> \n> For (1,1): value 1, life_span 2.

It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, since x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns from x=1 to x=6. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so rows from y=1 to y=6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. x from 1 to 6. So grid is 6x6, but with (5,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body at (6,6), and tail at (5,6). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1). Since direction is D, moving down means decreasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 2? Wait, the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? Let me check the input.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (1,1,1,1), (3,4,2,1), (5,1,5,1), (6,3,8,1)\n> \n> I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). So:\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): life_span=1, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (3,4): life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life_span=5, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (6,3): life_span=8, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive in this case, value=1 for all. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1), life span 1, so it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 9, life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn, when we have the state, the life_span is given, and it decreases each turn. For example, food at (1,1) has life_span=1 on turn 9. That means it will disappear after this turn. After turn 9, it's gone. Similarly, (3,4) has life_span=2, so it disappears after turn 10, and so on.\n> \n> Since we're on turn 9, and we take action for turn 9, then after that, the food with life_span=1 will be gone for turn 10.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the sequence should be for turns starting from t1=9.\n> \n> Action sequence for turn 9, 10, 11, etc., but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, movement constraints: current head direction is D (down). So I cannot instantly reverse to U (up) on the next turn. So for turn 9, since current direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6). So the snake is like: head at (6,5), which is bottom-right if y=6 is top? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) might be top-left, but here walls are x=0, y=0, etc. Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So probably x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Or top to bottom?\n> \n> The snake positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6).\n> \n> If y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, then (6,5) is right, near bottom? y=5, y=6 is above it? Let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so increasing y is up.\n> \n> But head direction is D, which is (x,y-1), so down, decreasing y, so towards lower y.\n> \n> In positions: head (6,5), which might be row 5, column 6. If y=0 is bottom, then (6,5) is at height 5, and (6,6) is above it at y=6. Then moving down to (6,5) from previous? Head is at (6,5), and direction is D, meaning it came from above? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. So head is (6,5), then next segment is (6,6), which is directly above if y increases up, and then (5,6), which is left of that.\n> \n> So the snake is: head at (6,5), body at (6,6) above it, and tail at (5,6) left of body. So the snake was moving left or something? Previous direction: head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> At turn 9, head is at (6,5), and it moved down to get there? But from where? Positions are listed head first, so at this state, head is (6,5), which it just moved to, I assume.\n> \n> The state is for the start of turn 9, I think. So positions are current positions at turn 9 before moving.\n> \n> But head direction is the direction it was moving to get to this position, I believe.\n> \n> Rule says: \"Snake Head Direction\": D, so it was moving down to reach (6,5).\n> \n> So previous position: before moving to (6,5), it was at some position. Since it moved down to (6,5), and body is at (6,6), which is above, so yes, it came from (6,6) down to (6,5). Then the body segments: from (6,6) to (5,6)? Positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), then (5,6).\n> \n> So the snake was: before moving, head was at (6,6), moved down to (6,5), so the body segment that was at (6,6) is now the second segment, and the tail was at (5,6), which is still there? When the head moves, the tail moves, but in this case, since it didn't eat, length remains, so tail moves.\n> \n> In Snake, when the head moves to a new cell, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> But here, positions are given as current: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)].\n> \n> So after the move to (6,5), the segment that was head is now at (6,5), the previous head (now body) is at (6,6), and the previous tail or something.\n> \n> Before move, positions might have been: head at (6,6), and body at (5,6), and another segment? Snake has three segments, so before moving, head was at (6,6), body at (5,6), and tail at say (5,5) or something? But positions given are after the move.\n> \n> I think it's simpler to accept the current positions: head at (6,5), body at (6,6), tail at (5,6). So the snake is forming a sort of L shape: from (6,5) down? (6,5) to (6,6) up, then to (5,6) left.\n> \n> From head to body: (6,5) to (6,6) is up, so the neck is above head. Then from (6,6) to (5,6) is left.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, down, meaning it was moving down to (6,5) from (6,6).\n> \n> For movement, since direction is D, I can move D, L, or R on this turn, but not U, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,4) , but y=4, is that valid? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6, so (6,4) is within bounds.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,6), but (6,6) is occupied by body, so collision? But rule says: can move into tail cell only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, for body collision: head touches any body segment except that you can move to the tail cell if the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell where the tail is, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,6). If I move to (6,6), which is occupied by body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Body segments: positions (6,6) and (5,6). (6,6) is the second segment, which is not the tail; tail is (5,6).\n> \n> So moving to (6,6) would be colliding with body, not tail, so death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,6) might be ok if I can, but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> From (6,5):\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - empty? I need to check if it's free.\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - empty?\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - occupied by body, collision, invalid\n> \n> So only possible moves are D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Also, walls: internal obstacle at (5,2), but that's not near here.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (1,1) - life span 1, value 1, but far away\n> \n> - (3,4) - life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (5,1) - life span 5, value 1\n> \n> - (6,3) - life span 8, value 1\n> \n> (6,3) is close to head at (6,5). (6,3) is two cells down from (6,5).\n> \n> (5,1) is also down and left.\n> \n> But (6,3) is directly below, at (6,3), head at (6,5), so distance |5-3|=2 in y-direction.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n> \n> Also, (3,4) is at x=3,y=4.\n> \n> And (1,1) at x=1,y=1.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,1) disappears after this turn, so if I don't eat it on turn 9, it's gone.\n> \n> But it's at (1,1), which is far from (6,5). To reach (1,1) from (6,5), I need at least |6-1| + |5-1| = 5 + 4 = 9 moves, but I can only move one per turn, and it's turn 9, so I can't reach it in one turn; it will disappear after turn 9, so I can't eat it at all. So forget about (1,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) has life span 2, so disappears after turn 10. Turn 9 and 10 actions, but from (6,5) to (3,4), distance |6-3| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4, which takes at least 4 turns, but I have turn 9 and 10, so by turn 10 I might reach if I go directly, but let's see.\n> \n> Turn 9: I move, then turn 10 I move, but after turn 10, the food disappears, so I need to eat it on or before turn 10.\n> \n> If I eat on turn 10, it's before it disappears.\n> \n> Life span 2 on turn 9, so after turn 9, life span becomes 1, then after turn 10, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 9 or turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But (3,4) is at distance, min moves: |dx=3|, |dy=1|, so min 4 moves, but I can do in fewer if diagonal, but I can only move orthogonally, so min 4 moves to reach (3,4) from (6,5).\n> \n> From (6,5) to (3,4): delta x = -3, delta y = -1, so need to move left 3 times and down 1 time, total 4 moves.\n> \n> But I have only two moves: turn 9 and turn 10. After turn 10 move, if I reach, I can eat on turn 10.\n> \n> But after turn 10, it disappears, so if I move on turn 10 to (3,4), I eat it.\n> \n> But can I reach in two moves? From (6,5), in one move I can go to (5,5) or (6,4).\n> \n> From (5,5), to (3,4) in one move? (5,5) to (3,4) is |dx=2|, |dy=1|, not adjacent; adjacent cells are (4,5), (5,4), (6,5), (5,6), etc. So from (5,5) to (3,4) not possible in one move; min two moves, e.g., to (4,5) then to (3,4), or (5,4) to (4,4) etc., but (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4).\n> \n> From (5,5), I can go to (4,5) or (5,4) or (5,6) or (6,5).\n> \n> Then from there, to (3,4) might take another move or more.\n> \n> Specifically, from (5,5), after one move to (4,5), then from (4,5) to (3,4) is adjacent, yes, since |dx=1|, |dy=1|, but in grid, moving to (3,4) from (4,5) is left and down, which is one move, but moves are only U/D/L/R, so to go from (4,5) to (3,4), I need to move left to (3,5) or down to (4,4), then to (3,4) in another move. Not directly.\n> \n> (4,5) to (3,4) is not adjacent orthogonally; adjacent cells share row or column, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (4,5) is adjacent to (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4).\n> \n> So from (4,5) to (3,4), I need to go to (3,5) or (4,4) first, then to (3,4) in second move.\n> \n> Similarly, from (6,5), if I go to (5,5), then to say (4,5), then to (3,5) or something, to reach (3,4) takes at least three moves: e.g., (6,5) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5), then (3,5) to (3,4) down, but that's four moves to (3,4).\n> \n> (6,5) to (5,5) L, then (5,5) to (4,5) L, then (4,5) to (4,4) D, then (4,4) to (3,4) L, but (3,4) is at (3,4), from (4,4) I can move left to (3,4).\n> \n> But that's three moves after turn 9?

So forget about (3,4) as well.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is impossible.\n> \n> Now, (5,1) has life span 5, so disappears after turn 13 (since turn 9: life 5, after turn 9:4, turn10:3, turn11:2, turn12:1, turn13:0 gone?

So if life span is L at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 10:\n> \n> - Food at (3,4): value 1, life span 2. So it can be eaten on turn 10 or 11, and disappears on turn 12.\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): value 1, life span 4. Can be eaten from turn 10 to 13, disappears turn 14.\n> \n> - Food at (6,3): value 1, life span 7. Can be eaten from turn 10 to 16, disappears turn 17.\n> \n> - Food at (6,1): value 1, life span 10. Can be eaten from turn 10 to 19, disappears turn 20.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,4), direction down. Possible moves: since head direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. The rule says: \"no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on this turn.\n> \n> Available moves: down, left, right.\n> \n> But I need to consider the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so accessible cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake body: positions (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). So cells occupied by snake: (6,4) head, (6,5) body, (6,6) tail.\n> \n> Since the tail will move when the snake moves, I can move into the tail's current position only if it's safe, meaning that after moving, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (3,4): this is left and same y, so from (6,4), moving left would take multiple steps to reach.\n> \n> - (5,1): down-left from head, but y=1 is near the bottom? y=0 is wall, y=1 is accessible.\n> \n> Coordinates: assuming (1,1) is bottom-left? The grid, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are inside. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often (0,0) is top-left, but here walls are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so the playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6), with (1,1) being, say, bottom-left or top-left? Not specified, but since y=0 is wall, and snake is at y=4,5,6, and food at y=4,3,1, so probably y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> The head is at (6,4) and direction down, so moving down increases y or decreases? Typically in grids, y increases downwards or upwards?\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y, which suggests that y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? Let's see.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. If U is (x,y+1), that means moving up increases y, so y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? But if y=0 is top wall, and U moves to y+1, that would be downward if y increases down.\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1)  // so if y increases, this is moving up if (0,0) is bottom-left, or down if (0,0) is top-left.\n> \n> In many games, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, so U (up) would be decreasing y, but here U is defined as (x,y+1), which for top-left (0,0) would move down.\n> \n> The definition: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> So, if we assume (0,0) is top-left corner, then:\n> \n> - y=0 is top row, y=7 is bottom row.\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) increases y, so moves down.\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) decreases y, so moves up.\n> \n> But that's counterintuitive; usually U is up.\n> \n> Perhaps (0,0) is bottom-left, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so it could be either.\n> \n> The head direction is given as D, down, and snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). If y increases downward, then (6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6) is moving downward, so head at (6,4), moving D to (6,5) or something? Positions are listed as head first: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)], so from head to tail, (6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6), so if y increases downward, (6,4) to (6,5) is moving down, which matches head direction D (down).\n> \n> In coordinate terms, if (6,4) to (6,5) is down, that means y=5 is below y=4, so y increases downward.\n> \n> Similarly, U: (x,y+1) would be to a higher y, so downward if y increases down.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) would be to lower y, so upward.\n> \n> But the direction is called U for up, but (x,y+1) is actually moving to higher y, which is downward if y=0 is top.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1) and D (x,y-1), and since moving from (6,4) D to (6,5) if positions are consecutive, but positions are (6,4) head, then (6,5), which is one step down if y increases down.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) moves down (increases y, downward)\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) moves up (decreases y, upward)\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) moves left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) moves right\n> \n> But the names: U is called \"up\" but it increases y, which is downward. That's inconsistent.\n> \n> Perhaps the names are based on direction, not coordinate change.\n> \n> U is meant to be upward, so if U is (x,y+1), that implies that y+1 is upward, meaning y decreases upward, so (0,0) must be bottom-left.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity.\n> \n> Let's look at the walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Snake at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). If (6,4) to (6,5) is down, and y=6 is higher than y=4 if y increases down, so (6,6) is below (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,4), (5,1), etc. (5,1) has y=1, which if y=0 is bottom wall, y=1 is above it, or if y=0 top, y=1 below.\n> \n> The head direction is D, down, and it's at (6,4), so to move down, it would go to (6,3) if D is (x,y-1), but current position is (6,4), body at (6,5), so from (6,4) to (6,5) is down, so D must be to (x,y+1) or something.\n> \n> Let's calculate the move.\n> \n> If head is at (6,4), and it moved to there from previous position. The positions are given as of now, so the head is at (6,4), and it came from where? The body is at (6,5), which is the previous head position, I assume.\n> \n> The snake positions: head at (6,4), then next segment at (6,5), then tail at (6,6). So the snake is oriented with head at (6,4), then down to (6,5), then (6,6), so it's moving downward.\n> \n> Therefore, moving from (6,4) to (6,5) would be down, so the direction down corresponds to increasing y if we assume y increases downward.\n> \n> Similarly, to move down from (6,4), it would go to (6,5), but (6,5) is currently occupied by the body, so it can't move there directly? No, it can move to the body cell if it's the tail, but (6,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,6).\n> \n> Let's think about movement.\n> \n> On the next move, the head will move to a new position, and the body will follow, so the tail will move from (6,6) to (6,5) or something.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a new cell, the tail leaves its current cell, so the cell (6,6) will be free after the move, but during the move, the head can move to a cell that was the tail, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for (6,5), it is the body, not tail, so if head moves to (6,5), it would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment cell causes collision, except for the tail cell.\n> \n> Here, cells occupied: head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (6,6).\n> \n> So, from head at (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, not tail, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up: to (6,3) but up is opposite to current direction? Current direction is D (down), so moving up would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Available moves:\n> \n> - Down: to (6,5) - but (6,5) is occupied by body, so if I move there, head touches body, collision, death.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4) - this is free? Need to check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Up: to (6,3) - but current direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed on next turn.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (5,4).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I can move in directions not opposite, so U is opposite, not allowed. D is same direction, but to (6,5) which is body, so collision. L and R are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> L to (5,4), R to (7,4) which is wall.\n> \n> So only L to (5,4) is possible?\n> \n> But (5,4) might be free. What is at (5,4)?

I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current state at turn 11:\n> \n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (5,4), then body segments at (6,4) and tail at (6,5). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (5,4) from (6,4) I assume, but let's see the positions: from (6,4) to (5,4) is left, so direction is L, which matches.\n> \n> - Food items:\n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 1\n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 6\n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: For (3,4), life span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 11, life span 1 means it will disappear at the end of turn 11 if not eaten. Similarly, (5,1) life span 3, so it has 3 turns left including turn 11, so it will disappear after turn 13 if not eaten. Let's clarify:\n> \n> \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning at turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, with life_span L, after this turn, countdown becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it stays, else disappears. So for (3,4) at turn 11, life_span=1, so after turn 11, countdown=0, disappears. Similarly, (5,1) life_span=3, after turn 11, countdown=2, then after turn 12, countdown=1, after turn 13, countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 11,12,13.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life_span=6, can be eaten until turn 16, and (6,1) life_span=9, until turn 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,4), direction L (left). So from (5,4), possible moves: U (up to (5,5)), D (down to (5,3)), L (left to (4,4)), R (right to (6,4)).\n> \n> But R to (6,4) is where the body is, but since the body will move when I move, let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on the next turn.\n> \n> So possible actions from (5,4): U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's reverse, and also (6,4) is the body, but let's check if it's safe.\n> \n> At turn 11, head at (5,4), body at (6,4) and (6,5). If I move right to (6,4), that is currently occupied by the first body segment. After I move, the snake moves: head to (6,4), then the body segments follow. Original positions: head (5,4), body1 (6,4), body2 (6,5).\n> \n> After moving right to (6,4): new head position (6,4). Then body1 moves to where head was, (5,4)? No, the body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving right:\n> \n> - Head was at (5,4), moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Body1 was at (6,4), moves to where head was, (5,4)? No: the segment that was at (6,4) becomes the new body segment after head, so it moves to the old head position (5,4).\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: body (6,4), index 2: tail (6,5)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,4) [since moved right]\n> \n> - Then segment that was index 1 (body) moves to where index 0 was, so to (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment that was index 2 (tail) moves to where index 1 was, so to (6,4)?

No: head (6,4), body1 at (5,4) [old head], body2 at (6,4)? That can't be, two segments at (6,4)? I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> So the new head is at the new position.\n> \n> Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n> \n> So old positions: seg0: (5,4), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (6,5)\n> \n> After head moves to new_pos, say (6,4) for right move:\n> \n> - New seg0 (head): (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg1 (first body): moves to where old seg0 was, which is (5,4)\n> \n> - New seg2 (tail): moves to where old seg1 was, which is (6,4)\n> \n> But (6,4) is now occupied by the new head, so the tail moves to (6,4), which is the same as head? That would cause collision.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (6,4), new body1 at (5,4), new body2 at (6,4) — but (6,4) is head, so body2 at (6,4) would mean head and body at same cell, collision.\n> \n> That can't be right. I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake games, when the head moves, if it moves into a cell that is about to be vacated by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,4): (6,4) is currently occupied by body segment, but after the move, the tail was at (6,5) and moves to (6,4), but since head is moving to (6,4), and the body segment that was at (6,4) is moving to (5,4), so at the new state, (6,4) has head, and the tail moves to where the body was, but the body was at (6,4), so tail moves to (6,4) but head is there, collision.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> At time t, positions: H: (5,4), B1: (6,4), B2: (6,5)\n> \n> I move head to (6,4). So new head position is (6,4).\n> \n> Now, B1, which was at (6,4), must move to the previous position of the head, which is (5,4). So B1 moves to (5,4).\n> \n> B2, which was at (6,5), must move to the previous position of B1, which was (6,4). So B2 moves to (6,4).\n> \n> But (6,4) is now the new head position, so when B2 moves to (6,4), it collides with the head.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (6,4) causes a collision because the head and the new position for B2 are the same.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is occupied by B1, not the tail. The tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> So moving to (6,4) is moving into a body segment that is not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) is the first body segment, not the tail, so moving to (6,4) should cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> Moreover, after move, as above, B2 moves to (6,4) while head is there.\n> \n> So definitely, moving right to (6,4) is invalid and causes death.\n> \n> Also, since current direction is L, moving R is reverse, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> U: to (5,5)\n> \n> D: to (5,3)\n> \n> L: to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) is y=5, which is between 0 and 7, not wall, similarly (5,3) ok, (4,4) ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), but we're not going there yet.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4) value 1, life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> - (5,1) value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,3) value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (6,1) value 1, life span 9\n> \n> Also, \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> Currently, is any food under the snake? Snake is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). Food at (6,3), (6,1), etc., (6,3) is at (6,3), which is not under snake, snake has (6,4) and (6,5), so (6,3) is adjacent but not under. Similarly, others are not under snake body.\n> \n> (6,4) is body, but no food there, food at (6,3) and (6,1).\n> \n> So all food is accessible if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Turn 11 now.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 11: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,4), then I can reach (3,4) to eat the food with life span 1.

Invalid.\n2. **Down (D) to (5, 2)**:\n   - (5, 2) is a wall. Invalid.\n3. **Left (L) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Valid move. No food here.\n4. **Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Valid move. Food at (6, 3) can be eaten.\n\n### Valid Actions:\n- **L (Left) to (4, 3)**.\n- **R (Right) to (6, 3)**.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Move R to (6, 3)**:\n   - Eat food at (6, 3), increasing score by +1 and snake length to 4.\n   - New snake positions: Head at (6, 3), body at (5, 3), (5, 4), tail at (6, 4).\n   - Next moves can be U to (6, 4) or D to (6, 2).\n   - This allows potential access to (6, 1) later.\n\n2. **Move L to (4, 3)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake length remains 3.\n   - New snake positions: Head at (4, 3), body at (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Next moves can be U, D, or L (no instant reverse to R).\n   - This path does not lead to any immediate food and may miss (5, 1) due to its short life span.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Moving **R to (6, 3)** is the better choice because:\n  - It immediately scores +1.\n  - It positions the snake to potentially reach (6, 1) later, which has a long life span.\n  - The alternative (L) does not lead to any food and risks missing the short-lived (5, 1).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

So moving to (5,4) is invalid and would kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down: from (5,3), down would be to (5,2).

Rule: Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - No food at (6, 4), so no growth.\n   - New positions: head at (6, 4), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Head direction becomes U (up).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (6, 2)**:\n   - (6, 2) is empty (no wall or snake).\n   - No food at (6, 2), so no growth.\n   - New positions: head at (6, 2), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Head direction becomes D (down).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - (5, 3) is a body segment (not the tail), so this is a collision. Invalid.\n   - Rule: Cannot move into non-tail body segments.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (7, 3)**:\n   - x=7 is a wall. Invalid.\n\n#### No Instant Reverse:\n- Current direction is R (right). Reverse is L (left), but moving L is already invalid due to collision, so no issue.\n\n#### Food Considerations:\n- (5, 1): Will disappear after turn 14 (current life_span = 2, so disappears after turn 14). Cannot be reached in time due to the wall at (5, 2).\n- (6, 1): Can be reached by moving down twice (D to (6, 2), then D to (6, 1)).\n- (2, 2): Too far away and not worth pursuing given other options.\n\n#### Best Move:\nFollow the previous plan: move **D (down)** to (6, 2) to set up for eating (6, 1) on turn 14. This maximizes score by eating (6, 1) while avoiding risks.\n\n### Action for Turn \\( t_0 = 13 \\):\n\\boxed{D}",

Also, an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (5,3), then (5,4), and tail at (6,4). So the snake has three segments.\n> \n> - Head direction: Down (D). Since it's moving down, from (5,4) to (5,3) at turn 12? Snake positions are given as [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]. Since head is first, at turn 12, head is at (5,3), which means it just moved down to (5,3) from (5,4) in the previous turn. Head direction is D, so it was moving down to (5,3).\n> \n> - Food:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food.

It's an 8x8 grid since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive, so 8 cells each way.\n> \n> Grid:\n> \n> - Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n> \n> - Walls: borders, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (5,3), body at (5,4), tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Food: (5,1), (6,3), (6,1)\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it's facing down. Since it moved down to (5,3), from (5,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (5,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by the body. However, in snake games, you can move to the tail's current position because the tail will move away, but only if it's the very next segment. Let's see the rules.\n> \n> Rule 3: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, the snake segments: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: body (5,4), index 2: tail (6,4).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,4), that's where the body is. But (5,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment. The tail is at (6,4). So moving to (5,4) would be a body collision because it's not the tail; it's the segment before tail.\n> \n> Let me read carefully.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] so head is (5,3), next is (5,4), then tail (6,4).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,4), that cell is occupied by the body segment at (5,4), which is not the tail. The tail is at (6,4). So moving to (5,4) would cause collision with body, since head touches a body segment that is not the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment is deadly. Only moving to the tail's current cell is safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is occupied by the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (6,4). So moving to (5,4) is invalid and would kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down: from (5,3), down would be to (5,2). But (5,2) is an internal obstacle, a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving left: to (4,3). Is that within bounds? x=4, y=3. Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is fine, y=3 fine. No wall mentioned except borders and (5,2), so (4,3) should be empty.\n> \n> Moving right: to (6,3). (6,3) has food? Food is at (6,3), which is positive food. But let's see if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> (6,3) is a food position, but I need to check if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) - occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (5,2) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,3) - possible, empty? Let's assume no snake or wall there.\n> \n> - R: (6,3) - has food, and no immediate collision? Snake body is at (5,4) and (6,4), so (6,3) is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So (6,3) is not occupied, it has food.\n> \n> But when I move, if I go to (6,3), I eat the food, and snake grows.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D. Movement constraints: no instant reverse. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up immediately because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Therefore, from current state, I cannot move up because it's reverse.\n> \n> But as I thought earlier, moving up is invalid anyway because (5,4) is body.\n> \n> So valid moves: L or R. D is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> U is invalid due to reverse and also body collision.\n> \n> So only L or R possible.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible actions for turn 12.\n> \n> Turn 12: from (5,3), head direction D.\n> \n> Can move: L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3), I eat the food at (6,3), which has value 1, life span 5. Since I eat it, snake length increases by 1. Current length 3, after eating, length 4.\n> \n> New snake positions: head moves to (6,3), then the body segments follow. Original body was (5,4) and (6,4). When head moves to (6,3), the body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,3), and the tail (6,4) moves to where the first body was? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So current positions: [head: (5,3), seg1: (5,4), seg2/tail: (6,4)]\n> \n> If head moves to (6,3), then new positions: head: (6,3), seg1: (5,3) [previous head], seg2: (5,4) [previous seg1], and since we ate food, a new segment is added at the tail position before move? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Rule: \"Positive Food: Length of snake +1\"\n> \n> So when you eat food, you grow, meaning that after movement, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail stays, and body extends.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new cell (food), new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> Before move: positions [P0, P1, P2] where P0 head, P1 body, P2 tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: head to new Q, then positions: [Q, P0, P1] so tail P2 is removed.\n> \n> After move with eating: head to new Q (food), then positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2] since new segment added at P2, so P2 stays, and we have new tail at P2, but P2 was tail, now it's body, new tail is... positions become [new head Q, then P0, P1, P2], so length increased by one, tail is P2.\n> \n> In this case, if I move right to (6,3) and eat food:\n> \n> Current: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> Head moves to (6,3) — eats food.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,3), then seg1 moves to previous head position (5,3), seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (5,4), and since ate, add new segment at previous tail position (6,4), so new tail is (6,4).\n> \n> But (6,4) is where seg2 was, and it stays, so positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]\n> \n> Head at (6,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), tail: (6,4)\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> If no eat, for example, if I move left to (4,3), no food there, so head to (4,3), seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (5,4), and tail (6,4) is removed, so new positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (4,3) no food, so no growth.\n> \n> Back to turn 12 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (6,3) — eat food, grow to length 4.\n> \n> Option 2: Move L to (4,3) — no food, length remains 3.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (5,1) life 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 12, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 14? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1) with life span 3 at turn 12:\n> \n> - Turn 12: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 13: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 14: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 15: gone? \"Disappears after N turns\" — so after N turns from now, it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, after L turns, it disappears. After turn t + L - 1, it might be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> Standard: countdown to 0.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? But since food can be eaten during the turn, I think when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after.\n> \n> But for planning, we need to know when it's available.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is L at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 12, life span 3, so available on turns 12,13,14; disappears on turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life span 5 at turn 12, available turns 12 to 16, disappears turn 17.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 8, available turns 12 to 19, disappears turn 20.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate choice.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,3) on turn 12, I eat that food.

Let's see.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 bottom or top? Typically in coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top, but in snake, it doesn't matter, positions are absolute.\n> \n> Assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa?

So we can only eat it this turn if we move to (5,1) now.\n> \n> Food life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for a food with life span S at turn T, it will disappear after turn T + S - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The description: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn T, if a food has life span N, then:\n> \n> - After turn T, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn T+1, countdown N-2, and so on.\n> \n> - After turn T + N - 1, countdown should be 0, and it disappears before turn T + N? I think it's better to think that at the start of turn T, the food has life span L, and after the turn, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after the turn, so it can be eaten only on that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for L=1 at turn 14, it can be eaten on turn 14, and after turn 14, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,1) with value 1, life span 6, so it will last until turn 19 (since 14 to 19 is 6 turns? From turn 14, life span 6: after turn 14, L=5; turn 15, L=4; ... turn 19, L=0, disappears after turn 19? Let's count:\n> \n> - Turn 14: L=6\n> \n> - After turn 14: L=5\n> \n> - After turn 15: L=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 19: L=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 14 to 19 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) with value 1, life span 9, so lasts until turn 22 or something.\n> \n> All food have value 1, positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: since we can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse. Current direction is D, so reverse would be U. So we cannot move U next. So possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> But we have to avoid walls and body, but body collision: head cannot touch body except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail is, as long as it doesn't cause collision after move.\n> \n> Specifically: we can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, because after moving, the tail moves forward, so it's safe.\n> \n> But other body segments, if head touches, it dies.\n> \n> Also walls.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 14.\n> \n> From (6,2):\n> \n> - U: to (6,3) but (6,3) is occupied by body segment, which is not the tail. Snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So (6,3) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Moving to (6,3) would be head colliding with body, death. So U is invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (6,1). What is at (6,1)? y=1, x=6. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,1) is within bounds, y=1 not 0. y=0 is wall, y=1 is ok. Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), not (6,1). So (6,1) is empty? But there is food at (6,1), but for movement, we can move there even if food, but eating happens if we move head there.\n> \n> First, is (6,1) safe? No walls, and no body? Body positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (6,1) not in list, so empty. So moving D to (6,1) is possible.\n> \n> - L: to (5,2). (5,2) is internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall, cannot move there. So L is invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (7,2). x=7 is border wall, since x=7 is wall, cannot move there. So R is invalid.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=7 is out of bounds, cannot move to (7,2).\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,1).\n> \n> But is that right? Directions:\n> \n> From (6,2):\n> \n> - U: (6,3) - body, invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,1) - seems ok\n> \n> - L: (5,2) - wall (internal obstacle), invalid\n> \n> - R: (7,2) - x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> So only D is possible? But that can't be right because if only D is possible, we have to go there.\n> \n> But at (6,1), there is food with value 1, life span 6. So if we move to (6,1), we eat the food, snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> But let's confirm the state.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> After move D to (6,1), head moves to (6,1), and since we eat food, we grow, so new head at (6,1), then the body: the tail doesn't move away because we grow, so positions become: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? No.\n> \n> When snake moves and eats food, it grows: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, and since we eat, we add a new segment at the end, so tail stays where it was or moves?\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head to new, each segment to previous, tail leaves old position.\n> \n> When eating, head to new, body moves, but tail stays, so new segment is added where tail was or something.\n> \n> Recall: when snake eats food, the length increases by one, so after move, the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the position where tail was before move? I think I have it.\n> \n> Typically: after moving to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the head moves to food cell, the body segments shift forward, and the tail remains, so the new tail is the old tail position, meaning we add a segment.\n> \n> For example, positions: H, B1, B2, T.\n> \n> Move to new cell with food: new head at new cell, then B1 goes to old H, B2 to old B1, T to old B2, and since we grow, we add a new segment at old T position, so now segments: new head, old H, old B1, old B2, old T.\n> \n> In this case: positions before move: [(6,2) H, (6,3) B1, (5,3) B2, (5,4) T]\n> \n> Move D to (6,1), which has food, so eat: new head at (6,1), then B1 moves to (6,2) (old H), B2 moves to (6,3) (old B1), T moves to (5,3) (old B2), and since we grow, we add a new segment at old T position (5,4), so new positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4), same as before? No: new tail is (5,4), but B2 is at (5,3), T at (5,4), and we added a segment at (5,4), so positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So the tail is still (5,4), but now it's part of body, and since we added a segment, the new tail is (5,4), which was old tail, but now it's not moving? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better: after growth, the snake has one more segment. The last segment before move was T at (5,4). After move, T moves to old B2 position (5,3), and a new segment is added at old T position (5,4), so the new tail is at (5,4), and positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) with (5,4) as tail.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, in this position, (6,1) has food, which we eat, so we get +1 score and grow.\n> \n> But is this safe? For turn 14, moving to (6,1) seems the only option.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, and there's another food at (5,1) with life span 1, which will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> (5,1) has life span 1 at turn 14, so we can eat it only this turn.\n> \n> But to eat (5,1), we need to move to (5,1) from current position (6,2).\n> \n> How? Possible moves: to (5,1) from (6,2), it would be left and down? (6,2) to (5,1) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (6,3) up, (6,1) down, (5,2) left, (7,2) right.\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is adjacent to (5,2), (6,1), (4,1), (5,0) but y=0 wall, etc.\n> \n> From (6,2), we cannot directly go to (5,1) because not adjacent; we need to go to a neighbor.\n> \n> To reach (5,1) this turn, we must move to a cell from which we can go to (5,1), but since we move one step per turn, from (6,2) this turn, we can only move to adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2).\n> \n> But (5,2) is wall, (7,2) wall, (6,3) body, so only (6,1) is possible, which is down.\n> \n> From (6,1), we can then move to (5,1) next turn? From (6,1), adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,0), (5,1), (7,1).\n> \n> (6,0) is y=0 wall, (7,1) x=7 wall, (6,2) is body if we move there, but after moving to (6,1), positions are as above, with (6,2) as body segment.\n> \n> If we move to (6,1) on turn 14, then on turn 15, head at (6,1), we can move to (5,1), since (5,1) is adjacent and should be empty or food.\n> \n> (5,1) has food with life span 1, but at turn 14, if we don't eat it, after turn 14, it disappears because life span 1.\n> \n> Turn 14: we are at turn 14, if we move to (6,1) on turn 14, we eat that food, but (5,1) is not eaten this turn, so after turn 14, (5,1) disappears since life span 1.\n> \n> So we cannot eat (5,1) at all; it's only available this turn and we can't reach it from current position in one move because (5,1) is not adjacent to (6,2); the cells adjacent to (6,2) are (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2), none of which is (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is at (5,1), adjacent to (5,2), (5,0), (4,1), (6,1).\n> \n> From (6,2), to go to (5,1), it would require two moves, but (5,1) disappears after this turn, so impossible to eat it. So (5,1) is not reachable this turn, so we ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is reachable and has food.\n> \n> And (2,2) is far away.\n> \n> So for turn 14, only possible move is D to (6,1), eating the food there.\n> \n> Then, after that, on turn 15, head at (6,1), direction is D (since we moved down).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: from (6,1), we can go U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to U? Reverse of D is U, so we cannot move U next.\n> \n> Current direction after moving D to (6,1) is D, so for next turn, cannot move U (reverse).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by body segment. Positions: after turn 14, snake is at [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (6,2) is body, cannot move there, collision. So U invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (5,1), which is adjacent, and what is there? (5,1) had food but it disappeared after turn 14, so now empty? After turn 14, (5,1) life span 1, so after turn 14, it disappears, so on turn 15, (5,1) is empty.\n> \n> Also, not wall or body. Walls: internal obstacle (5,2), not (5,1). Body: positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), so (5,1) not occupied. So L to (5,1) is possible.\n> \n> - R: to (7,1), x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> But (5,1) is empty, no food, so we just move there without eating.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), new positions: head to (5,1), then segments shift: (6,1) moves to (6,1)? Head moves to (5,1), then body: first segment (6,2) moves to old head position (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied? No, when moving, the head moves first to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So positions before move: [(6,1) H, (6,2) B1, (6,3) B2, (5,3) B3, (5,4) T]\n> \n> After move to (5,1) without eating: head to (5,1), then B1 to old H (6,1)? Old H was (6,1), but now head moved to (5,1), so B1 moves to where H was, which is (6,1). Then B2 moves to where B1 was, (6,2). Then B3 moves to where B2 was, (6,3). Then T moves to where B3 was, (5,3). And since no eat, tail leaves (5,4), so new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] with tail at (5,3).\n> \n> T was (5,4), moves to old B3 position (5,3), so (5,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Now head at (5,1), direction L (since we moved left from (6,1) to (5,1)).\n> \n> Now on turn 16, head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: cannot reverse to R (since L reverse is R).\n> \n> - U: to (5,2) but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0), y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1), which is within bounds? x=4,y=1, not wall, no body? Body positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (4,1) not occupied. So L possible.\n> \n> - R: to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body segment B1, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,1).\n> \n> Move to (4,1), no food, positions: head to (4,1), then B1 to old H (5,1), B2 to old B1 (6,1), B3 to old B2 (6,2), T to old B3 (6,3), tail was (5,3) moves to old B3 position (6,3)? Positions before: H(5,1), B1(6,1), B2(6,2), B3(6,3), T(5,3)? B3 is (5,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> After turn 15: positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] with (5,3) as tail? Segments: head (5,1), then next is (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), then tail (5,3). So B1 (6,1), B2 (6,2), B3 (6,3), T (5,3).\n> \n> After move to (4,1): head to (4,1), then B1 to old H (5,1), B2 to old B1 (6,1), B3 to old B2 (6,2), T to old B3 (6,3).

It's turn 15, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but only cells with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6 are playable? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> For example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. But since it's a grid, cells like (1,0) are walls, etc. But for movement, we can only move to cells not occupied by walls or snake body except tail.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Head direction is D, meaning down, so the snake was moving down to (6,1) from (6,2)? Positions are given with head first, so at turn 15, head is at (6,1), and it was at (6,2) before, but since direction is D, it moved down to (6,1). Head direction is the current direction it moved to get to (6,1), I think. The input says \"Snake Head Direction: D\", and positions are [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)], so from (6,2) to (6,1) is down, so direction is down, meaning it came from above? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, the head moves to a new cell. Here, positions list the current cells: head at (6,1), then body segments. Since head direction is D, that means the snake was moving down, so from (6,2) to (6,1), so previous head was at (6,2), now at (6,1) down.\n> \n> For the next move, since direction is D, the possible moves are not opposite, so cannot go U (up), but can go D, L, or R? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is D, so cannot move U next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,1): down to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so not possible. Left to (5,1), or right to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so right not possible. Or up to (6,2), but (6,2) is part of the body, except it's the segment just behind the head.\n> \n> Let's list all possible actions from current position.\n> \n> Current head: (6,1)\n> \n> Direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U (up): to (6,2) - but (6,2) is occupied by the second segment of the snake. Is this a collision? Generally, moving into a body segment is deadly, except for the tail if it moves away. But here, (6,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,4). The segments are: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) tail. So (6,2) is the immediate body segment, so moving to (6,2) would cause head to collide with body, death.\n> \n> - D (down): to (6,0) - but y=0 is wall, so wall collision, death.\n> \n> - L (left): to (5,1)\n> \n> - R (right): to (7,1) - x=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,1). Is that safe?\n> \n> (5,1): let's check if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,1) is not (5,2), so no obstacle there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So (5,1) is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is L to (5,1). But is that the only choice? I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: only one food given: (2,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food).\n> \n> Life span 9, current turn 15, so it disappears after N turns, N=9, so it will disappear at turn 15 + 9 - 1? Let's see the life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 15, food at (2,2) has life span 9, meaning it will disappear after 9 more turns, so at turn 24 (15 + 9 = 24), it disappears? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so at turn 15, life span is 9, after turn 15, it decreases to 8, and so on, until turn 15+9=24, at turn 24, before the turn, life span would be 0? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t when it spawns, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and when life span reaches 0, it disappears. But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t, with life span N, at turn t, countdown is N, after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears. So it exists for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose food appears at turn T with life span N. At turn T, countdown = N. After turn T is processed, countdown becomes N-1. After turn T+1, N-2, ..., after turn T + N -1, countdown becomes 0, and then it disappears before turn T + N.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N turns and gone on the N+1th turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life span L, it has L turns left including the current one. After L turns, it disappears. So for turn 15, life span 9, it will disappear after turn 23? Let's see.\n> \n> If at turn 15, life span 9, and countdown decreases every turn including current, so during turn 15, it is present, after turn 15, countdown=8. After turn 16, countdown=7, ..., after turn 23, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 24. So it can be eaten from turn 15 to turn 23 inclusive? At turn 23, countdown=1, after eaten or not, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as head moves to it when countdown >0, it can be eaten.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 15, life span 9, so it has 9 turns left, meaning it can be eaten in the next 9 turns, from turn 15 to turn 23.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Current position: head at (6,1), direction D.

The segments: original positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] after moving left to (5,1), head is now (5,1), and the body: the segment that was at (6,1) is now part of body, so positions become: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] and tail was (5,4), which is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> So new snake: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3).

But (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> (4,1): x=4, y=1, within bounds? Walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) is playable.

So, that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake has 5 segments. Head is at (5,1), and it's moving left (direction L), which makes sense because from (5,1) to (6,1) is left? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Coordinates: head (5,1), next segment (6,1). Since head is first, and direction is L, meaning it was moving left to get to (5,1). Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: L\", which I think means the current direction it's facing, so it can move in that direction or perpendicular, but not opposite instantly.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,1)\n> \n> Previous position: since snake positions are [(5,1), (6,1), ...], so the head moved from (6,1) to (5,1) on the last move, so direction L is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,2), life span 8 at turn 16, so it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 16 + 8 = 24? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 16, life span is 8, so it decreases to 7 on turn 17, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it will be gone on turn 24? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 on turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the start of turn when countdown reaches 0? I think we need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is L at turn t, it means it will disappear after L more turns. So on turn t+L, it might still be there at the beginning, but after that turn, it disappears. I think for planning, we can think it will be available for L turns including the current turn? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after decreasing N times, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food with life span N: on turn t, countdown = N; after turn t, countdown = N-1; ... after turn t + N - 1, countdown = 1; after turn t + N, countdown = 0 and it disappears before turn t + N + 1.\n> \n> But for movement and eating, during turn t + k for k=0 to N-1, the food is present, and on turn t + N, it might be gone before the turn starts? I think we need to see when it can be eaten.\n> \n> The food can be eaten on any turn as long as countdown > 0, I assume. When the head moves onto it during a turn, it is eaten if countdown > 0 at that time.\n> \n> But countdown decreases after the turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't specify when exactly.\n> \n> To simplify, I think for planning, we can assume that at the start of turn, the life span is as given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. So for food available on turn t with life L, it can be eaten on turns from t to t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,2): at turn 16, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 16 to 23 (since after 8 decreases, on turn 24 it would be 0 and gone). Similarly, (3,2) life span 10, can be eaten from 16 to 25.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,1), direction L, so possible moves: since it was moving left, it can move up (U), down (D), or left (L), but not right (R) because reverse is not allowed instantly.

But moving into any other body cell is deadly.\n> \n> In this case, (6,1) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,3).\n> \n> So, if head moves to (6,1), which is occupied by the first body segment, it would collide and die.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is obstacle, (5,0) is wall, so only possible move is to (4,1).\n> \n> But (4,1) is empty?

When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving left to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Body: (5,1) from old head, then (6,1) from first body, then (6,2), then (6,3), and the tail (5,3) is removed?

Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn. So food at (2,2) will disappear in 7 turns, by turn 17 + 7 = 24. Similarly, (3,2) disappears by turn 17 + 9 = 26.\n> \n> The grid size: Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid, from (0,0) to (7,7).

Then (6,2) and (6,3) are above.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (3,2), so y=2.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (4,1):\n> \n> - U: (4,2)\n> \n> - D: (4,0)\n> \n> - L: (3,1)\n> \n> - R: not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are safe.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7.

(4,2) is not a border, and no internal obstacle mentioned except (5,2), so (4,2) should be empty.\n> \n> (3,1): should be empty, no wall or obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> Also, body positions: snake is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (3,1) is not occupied by body, similarly (4,2) not occupied, (4,0) is wall.\n> \n> So valid moves: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).

Since it moved, the segment that was at (4,1) is now the second segment at (4,1), but after moving head to (3,1), the body follows: the first body segment goes to where head was, (4,1), then next to where first body was, (5,1), then (6,1), then (6,2), and tail was at (6,3), but since we moved, the tail is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, length remains same, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving L to (3,1) without eating food, new positions: head (3,1), then body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail was (6,3), removed.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is still there.\n> \n> On turn 18, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> (3,2) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, and snake grows, so tail is not removed, new tail added.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,2), which I might want later.\n> \n> But life span: (3,2) has life span 9, from turn 17, so it will disappear at turn 26?

There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail at (6,2). So the snake has 5 segments.

Life span decreases each turn, including this one, so for (2,2), after turn 18, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc. Similarly for (3,2), it starts at 8 and will decrease.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,1), moving left. Possible moves from here: since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be an instant reverse. From (3,1), moving left would go to (2,1), up to (3,2), or down to (3,0). But (3,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so down is invalid. Similarly, moving left to (2,1) – is (2,1) a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,1) should be fine. Moving up to (3,2) – (3,2) has food, but I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 18:\n> \n> - L: move to (2,1)\n> \n> - U: move to (3,2)\n> \n> - D: move to (3,0) – but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: move to (4,1) – but (4,1) is the second segment of the snake body, and since the snake will move, the tail will move away, but let's think carefully.\n> \n> Collision rules: moving into a body segment is deadly, except for the tail. Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by the body after movement, it's a collision. But the tail is special because when the head moves, the tail also moves forward if no food is eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, if no food is eaten, the tail moves to the next position, so the cell that was tail becomes empty. If food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 18, if I move right to (4,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment. But after movement, since I'm moving to (4,1), and the current position of head is (3,1), moving to (4,1) which is where the body is.\n> \n> But the body segment at (4,1) will move to where the head was or something? Let's think step by step.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n> \n> If I move right to (4,1), the new head position is (4,1). But (4,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the head moves to (4,1), and since no food is eaten, the tail should move away. But when the head moves to a cell that is part of the body, it might cause a collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (4,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. The tail is at (6,2). So moving to (4,1) would cause head to touch a body segment, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,2) might be possible, but (3,2) has food, so I need to check.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,1) – is this valid? (2,1) is not a wall, and not occupied by body? Before move, positions are (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), so (2,1) is empty. After move, head to (2,1), body segments shift: new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) moves to where? When head moves to new cell, and no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new snake positions would be [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] because the tail (6,2) is cut off, and the segment at (6,1) becomes the new tail? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the new head is that cell, then the body follows from the old head position, so the last body segment is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So initial positions: index 0: head (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: tail (6,2)\n> \n> After moving left to (2,1): new head is (2,1). Then the body: the first body segment is the old head (3,1), then (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1). The tail (6,2) is not included because no food eaten, so the snake shortens; the segment at (6,2) is removed, and (6,1) becomes the new tail. So new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n> \n> (6,1) was already a position, but now it's the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move up to (3,2), and if I eat food there, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But let's first list possible actions.\n> \n> From (3,1):\n> \n> - L: to (2,1) – valid, no wall, not body.\n> \n> - R: to (4,1) – but (4,1) is body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - U: to (3,2) – (3,2) is not wall, and has food, but need to check if it's body? Current positions: (3,1), (4,1), etc., (3,2) is not in snake positions, so it's empty except for food. So moving to (3,2) should be possible.\n> \n> - D: to (3,0) – y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: L or U.\n> \n> Now, moving U to (3,2) would eat the food there, since it's positive food at (3,2). Value +1, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> Life span of that food is 8, so it will disappear if not eaten soon, but since I'm moving to it, I can eat it now.\n> \n> But there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (6,2), and I'm moving to (3,2), which is not adjacent to tail. (3,2) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are 3 units apart in x.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (3,2) and (6,2) are not adjacent; (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3), etc.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,2), so no issue.\n> \n> Also, the food is at (3,2), not under tail.\n> \n> So moving U to (3,2) should be safe and I eat the food.\n> \n> Then, after eating, snake grows: new head at (3,2), and tail stays, so positions become [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]? Let's see: old positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n> \n> Move head to (3,2), which is new head. Since food eaten, tail does not move, so the body is old head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So new positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] with length 6.\n> \n> Now, head direction after move: since I moved up, new head direction is U.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> There's another food at (2,2) with life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life span decreases each turn, starting from turn 18.\n> \n> At turn 18, life span is given as 6 for (2,2), so after turn 18, it will have 5 left, meaning it disappears after turn 18 + 6 = turn 24? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 18, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including turn 18. After turn 18, life span becomes 5, so it will disappear after turn 23? After turn 18, countdown decreases to 5, then after turn 19 to 4, ..., after turn 23, it decreases to 0 and disappears before turn 24? I think it's better to think: it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 after the turn, and if L-1=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, since we act on turn t, we can eat it if we move to it on turn t when life span >0.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2), life span 8 at turn 18, so it will last until turn 25 or something.\n> \n> But since I can eat (3,2) now on turn 18.\n> \n> Now, back to actions: I can choose L to (2,1) or U to (3,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (3,2), I eat the food, grow to length 6, head now at (3,2) direction U.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body, so invalid, L to (2,2), or R to (4,2).\n> \n> (2,2) has food, so I could go there.\n> \n> But let's think about the other option: if I go L to (2,1) on turn 18.\n> \n> Then head to (2,1), no food eaten, so snake positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Then head direction L.\n> \n> From (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), U to (2,2), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, R to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body, invalid?

It's turn 20. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), then body segments at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (2,2) from (3,2)? Let me list the positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (6,2)  // this is the tail\n> \n> Since head direction is L, it came from (3,2) to (2,2), so it's facing left.\n> \n> Now, food: there's one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body! It's the third segment: positions are [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), ...] so (4,1) is the fourth segment? Let's index:\n> \n> - Index 0: (2,2) head\n> \n> - Index 1: (3,2)\n> \n> - Index 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Index 3: (4,1)\n> \n> - Index 4: (5,1)\n> \n> - Index 5: (6,1)\n> \n> - Index 6: (6,2) tail\n> \n> So (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 3.\n> \n> The food is at (4,1) with value 1, life span 9. But since the snake is on that cell, it can't be eaten now. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Life span is 9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, including the current turn. So from turn 20, it will be there for turns 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, and disappear after turn 28? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 20, life span 9, so after turn 20, life span becomes 8, then 7, ..., down to 0 after turn 28, meaning it disappears before turn 29. So it can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 28 inclusive, I think. But since it's under the snake now, it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and comes back.\n> \n> Also, the food has value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, what are the possible moves? Head is at (2,2), direction is L, so last move was left. Since no instant reverse, I cannot move right (opposite of left) on this turn. So possible moves: Up, Down, Left. But Left to (1,2)? Need to check if that's valid.\n> \n> Check for walls and collisions.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,2) is within bounds: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (1,2) is ok, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is far from (1,2), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, body collisions: if I move left to (1,2), is that occupied by body? Current body positions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (1,2) is not in the list, so it's free.\n> \n> If I move up to (2,3): (2,3) not in positions, and within grid.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,1): (2,1) not in positions, within grid.\n> \n> Move right is invalid because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 20: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food. The food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body segment leaves (4,1), and then later the head moves to (4,1).\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (4,1) is index 3. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The tail segment is removed, but since we eat food, we grow, but only if we eat positive food.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet, so when we move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> If I move from (2,2) to a new position, say to (1,2) if I go left.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (1,2), then body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and tail (6,1) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So from current: positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n> \n> After move, if head moves to new_pos, then new body: [new_pos, (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and the tail (6,2) is removed, so snake has 7 segments still, since no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, after move, the cell (4,1) is still occupied? Let's see:\n> \n> After head moves to (1,2) for example:\n> \n> New positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and (6,2) is free now.\n> \n> So (4,1) is still occupied by the body segment that was at (3,1) before? Before move, segment at index 2 is (3,1), index 3 is (4,1).\n> \n> After move to left: head to (1,2), then segment 1: old head (2,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (3,2), segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1), segment 4: old segment 3 (4,1), segment 5: old segment 4 (5,1), segment 6: old segment 5 (6,1). And old segment 6 (6,2) is gone.\n> \n> So (4,1) is now occupied by segment 4, which was previously at (4,1), so it hasn't moved yet. The segment that was at (4,1) is still there because the body moves sequentially.\n> \n> To vacate (4,1), the snake needs to move several times so that the segment at (4,1) moves away.\n> \n> Currently at turn 20, (4,1) is occupied by segment index 3.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> For (4,1) to be vacated, the segment that was at (4,1) must move to a new position, which happens when the segments before it move.\n> \n> Specifically, when the head moves, the segment at index 1 moves to old head position, index 2 moves to old index 1 position, and so on, until the tail moves to the position of the second last segment.\n> \n> So for (4,1) to be free, the segment currently there must move away, which happens when the snake moves forward and that segment is no longer occupied.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be free when the segment that was there has moved to a different cell.\n> \n> In the initial position, segment at index 3 is at (4,1).\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, say to (1,2), then segment index 3 moves to the old position of index 2, which is (3,1). So now (4,1) is occupied by segment index 4, which was at (5,1) before? Let's track:\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Index 0 (head): (2,2)\n> \n> Index 1: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 4: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (6,1)\n> \n> Index 6: (6,2) tail\n> \n> After move head to (1,2):\n> \n> New index 0 (head): (1,2)\n> \n> New index 1: old index 0: (2,2)\n> \n> New index 2: old index 1: (3,2)\n> \n> New index 3: old index 2: (3,1)  // this was (3,1), now at (3,1)? No\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the cell of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head at (1,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1 at old head (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 2 at old segment 1 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 3 at old segment 2 (3,1)  // old segment 2 was (3,1), so new segment 3 at (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 4 at old segment 3 (4,1)  // old segment 3 was (4,1), so new segment 4 at (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 5 at old segment 4 (5,1)  // (5,1)\n> \n> - New segment 6 at old segment 5 (6,1)  // and old segment 6 (6,2) is removed\n> \n> So now positions: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> (4,1) is still occupied, by new segment 4.\n> \n> The segment that was at (4,1) is now at (4,1) as new segment 4, so it hasn't moved; the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (4,1), we need the snake to move such that the segment that is there moves to a different cell.\n> \n> For example, if we move several times, eventually the body segment at (4,1) will move when the segments before it move.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at a position moves only when it is not the tail; it moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is occupied by a body segment, and it will move when the snake moves, but it moves to the position of the segment that was before it in the chain.\n> \n> For the cell (4,1) to be free, we need that after a move, no segment is at (4,1).\n> \n> That happens when the segment that was at (4,1) has moved to a different cell, and no new segment moves to it.\n> \n> Since the snake moves sequentially, (4,1) will be vacated when the tail moves away from it or when the segment there is the tail and it moves.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 20, (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> The tail is at (6,2), so (4,1) is a middle segment.\n> \n> To vacate (4,1), we need the snake to move enough times so that the segment that was at (4,1) is no longer there, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the segments shift, so the cell (4,1) might be occupied by a different segment if the snake is long.\n> \n> Let's calculate when (4,1) will be free.\n> \n> The food at (4,1) has life span 9, from turn 20, so it will be there until turn 28 (since countdown from 9 to 0 over 9 turns: turn 20: life 9, turn 21: life 8, ..., turn 28: life 1, turn 29 it disappears, so can be eaten from turn 20 to 28).\n> \n> But at turn 20, it's under the snake, so not eatable.\n> \n> To eat it, we need to vacate the cell and then have the head move there.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be vacated when the segment currently there moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is index 3. When the snake moves, this segment will move to the position of the segment before it, which is index 2 at (3,1).\n> \n> For example, after one move, as above, if head moves left, new segment 4 is at (4,1), which is the same cell.\n> \n> The position (4,1) is occupied as long as there is a segment that needs to be there.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be free only when the tail passes through it and moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the tail will eventually move, but we need to see the path.\n> \n> From current positions, the tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the second last segment.\n> \n> For (4,1) to be free, the segment that is at (4,1) must be the tail, and when it moves, (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) is not the tail; it's index 3 out of 7.\n> \n> The tail is at index 6.\n> \n> The distance from head to the segment at (4,1) is 3 segments away.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be occupied until the tail moves past it.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Head at (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is the fourth segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves forward in the chain.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be vacated when the segment that was at (4,1) has moved to (3,1) or something, but it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to think that the cell (4,1) is currently occupied, and it will be free when the tail of the snake is no longer covering it, but since the snake moves, it depends on the movement direction.\n> \n> To free (4,1), the snake needs to move in a way that the body moves away from that cell.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves up or down from the head, it might start to turn.\n> \n> Since the head is at (2,2), and we can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> If I move left to (1,2), then positions become: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  -- (4,1) still occupied.\n> \n> Then if I move again, say left to (0,2), but (0,2) is a wall because x=0 is border wall. So I can't move left to (0,2) because it's a wall.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, so from (1,2), moving left to (0,2) is invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1), or L but L to (0,2) wall, so only U or D.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> Back to turn 20.\n> \n> Another thing: the food at (4,1) has value 1, but there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to head; head at (2,2), tail at (6,2), not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> But if later the head is near the tail and we eat food at tail, it could be dangerous.\n> \n> For now, I need to plan to eat the food at (4,1) if possible.\n> \n> But it's under the body, so I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (4,1).\n> \n> How many moves to free (4,1)?\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is index 3. When the snake moves, this segment will move to the position of index 2, which is (3,1), but only if the head moves and the chain shifts.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at index 3 moves to old index 2 position, but the cell (4,1) is then occupied by the segment that was at index 4, old (5,1).\n> \n> So (4,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> In fact, (4,1) will be occupied until the tail moves to it and then away.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,2). The path from tail to (4,1) is (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n> \n> So the tail is 3 segments away from (4,1).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail will move towards the body.\n> \n> After one move, tail moves to (6,1) if head moves, as in earlier example.\n> \n> After two moves, tail might be at (5,1), etc.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> At turn 20: positions: H(2,2), B1(3,2), B2(3,1), B3(4,1), B4(5,1), B5(6,1), T(6,2)\n> \n> After one move, say head moves left to (1,2): new H(1,2), B1(2,2), B2(3,2), B3(3,1), B4(4,1), B5(5,1), T(6,1)  -- B3 is at (3,1), B4 at (4,1), so (4,1) occupied by B4.\n> \n> After second move, suppose head moves down to (1,1): new H(1,1), B1(1,2), B2(2,2), B3(3,2), B4(3,1), B5(4,1), T(5,1)  -- B5 at (4,1)\n> \n> (4,1) still occupied.\n> \n> After third move, head moves right to (2,1): but from (1,1), moving right to (2,1), which is now free?

B4 at (2,2), but head is at (2,2), collision? No, in the sequence:\n> \n> After third move (turn 22): head moved to (2,1) from (1,1), so positions at turn 22: H(2,1), B1(1,1), B2(1,2), B3(2,2), B4(3,2), B5(3,1), T(4,1)\n> \n> Then at turn 23, if head moves U to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by B3, so head would collide with body at (2,2).

Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, y from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells. But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the walls are the borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving upwards.\n> \n> Food: only one food listed: (4,1,8,1). That must be (x,y, life_span, value). So food at (4,1) with life_span 8 and value 1. But value is 1, which is positive, so it's positive food.\n> \n> The food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake! Let's see: snake positions are [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. So (4,1) is the fifth segment, not the head. So the food is under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So since it's under a body segment, not the head, it can't be eaten now. The life_span is 8, and current turn is 21, so it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 29? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so starting from turn 21, it has 8 turns left. After 8 decreases, it disappears. So on turn 21, life_span=8; turn 22, it becomes 7; ... turn 28, it becomes 1; turn 29, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to 28, but only if the head can reach it after the body moves away.\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (2,3), moving up. Direction is U, so from (2,3), moving up would go to (2,4).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Head direction U.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from U, opposite is D, so I cannot move D. So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - If move U: head to (2,4)\n> \n> - If move L: head to (1,3)  (since x decreases)\n> \n> - If move R: head to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food at (4,1). It's under the body at (4,1), which is part of the snake. To eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body segment leaves (4,1), and then the head moves to (4,1).\n> \n> But (4,1) is currently occupied, so the snake must move in such a way that the tail or some body part moves off (4,1) first.\n> \n> The snake moves by the head moving to a new cell, and the tail may or may not move depending on whether food is eaten.\n> \n> When the head moves, if it moves to a food cell, it eats it, grows longer, and the tail doesn't move. If no food, it moves to the new cell, and the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> But in this case, food is under the body, not accessible until the body moves away.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,1), since it's occupied, the head can't move to it until it's free.\n> \n> Now, the food has life_span 8, so it will be there until turn 28, disappearing on turn 29.\n> \n> Current turn 21, so we have 8 turns to potentially eat it.\n> \n> But we need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> Also, there might be other foods, but only one is listed, so probably no other food now. The state says \"Food Positions\", and only one, so we have to work with that.\n> \n> Now, the snake is at positions: let's list the cells:\n> \n> - Head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)  <-- food here\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,1)\n> \n> - Tail: (6,1)\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves off, so the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves to a new cell, say (x,y), then the new head is (x,y), and the body from (2,2) to (6,1) shifts, so segment 1 becomes the new position of what was segment 1, but actually, the snake body moves: the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after one move without eating:\n> \n> - New head: new position\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 position (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 position (4,1)  but (4,1) had food, but since not eaten, it moves? Let's think.\n> \n> The position (4,1) is currently occupied by segment 4. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail (6,1) is removed, and each segment moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically: the head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> So after one move, the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (4,1), which is occupied by segment 4. When the snake moves without eating, segment 4 will move to where segment 3 was? Let's index the segments.\n> \n> Define: positions at turn t:\n> \n> - Head: P0(t) = (2,3)\n> \n> - P1(t) = (2,2)\n> \n> - P2(t) = (3,2)\n> \n> - P3(t) = (3,1)\n> \n> - P4(t) = (4,1)  // food here\n> \n> - P5(t) = (5,1)\n> \n> - Tail P6(t) = (6,1)  // since 7 segments, indices 0 to 6.\n> \n> After a move to a new head position P0(t+1), if no food eaten:\n> \n> - P0(t+1) = new position\n> \n> - P1(t+1) = P0(t)  // old head position\n> \n> - P2(t+1) = P1(t)  // old segment 1 position\n> \n> - P3(t+1) = P2(t)\n> \n> - P4(t+1) = P3(t)\n> \n> - P5(t+1) = P4(t)\n> \n> - P6(t+1) = P5(t)  // and old P6(t) is vacated\n> \n> So for the food at (4,1) = P4(t), after one move, P4(t+1) = P3(t) = (3,1), so the cell (4,1) is now occupied by P5(t+1)? P5(t+1) = P4(t) = (4,1), so (4,1) is still occupied by P5(t+1), which is the new segment 5.\n> \n> At time t, P4(t) is at (4,1)\n> \n> At time t+1, if no eat, P5(t+1) = P4(t) = (4,1), so (4,1) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Similarly, P4(t+1) = P3(t) = (3,1)\n> \n> So the food at (4,1) remains covered if the segment that was there moves to the next position, but since the snake shifts, the cell (4,1) might be occupied by a subsequent segment or vacated if it was the tail.\n> \n> In this case, P4(t) is at (4,1), and P4 is not the tail; tail is P6.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, the tail P6(t) is removed, so (6,1) is vacated, but (4,1) is now occupied by P5(t+1) = P4(t) = (4,1), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> Only when the segment that is at (4,1) moves off and the tail moves, but since (4,1) is not the tail, it will be occupied until that part of the body moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,1) to be vacated, the snake needs to move enough times that the segment that was at (4,1) becomes the tail and moves off.\n> \n> At time t, segment at (4,1) is P4.\n> \n> After one move, P5 is at (4,1)\n> \n> After two moves, P6 is at (4,1)  because P6(t+2) = P5(t+1) = P4(t) = (4,1) at time t+2? Let's think step by step.\n> \n> At time t: P4 at (4,1)\n> \n> Time t+1: P5 at P4(t) = (4,1)\n> \n> Time t+2: P6 at P5(t+1) = (4,1)  since P5(t+1) is at (4,1)\n> \n> Time t+3: when head moves, if no eat, P6(t+2) is at (4,1), and at t+3, the new tail is P5(t+2), but P6(t+3) = P5(t+2), and P5(t+2) was at P4(t+1) or something.\n> \n> Better to think that each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment over time.\n> \n> The position (4,1) will be occupied until the segment that is there becomes the tail.\n> \n> At time t, P4 is at (4,1), which is not tail.\n> \n> After one move, P5 is at (4,1), still not tail.\n> \n> After two moves, P6 is at (4,1), which is the tail.\n> \n> Then at the next move, time t+3, when head moves to new position, if no food eaten, the tail P6(t+2) at (4,1) moves off, so (4,1) is vacated, and the new tail is at P5(t+2) position.\n> \n> At time t+2: P6 is at (4,1)\n> \n> Time t+3: head moves to new position, say Q.\n> \n> Then new P0(t+3) = Q\n> \n> P1(t+3) = P0(t+2)  // old head\n> \n> ...\n> \n> P5(t+3) = P4(t+2)\n> \n> P6(t+3) = P5(t+2)  // and the old P6(t+2) position is vacated, which is (4,1)\n> \n> So after three moves from now, at turn t+3 = 24, the cell (4,1) will be vacated if no food is eaten in between.\n> \n> Current turn t=21.\n> \n> After move at turn 21: if no eat, then at turn 22, P6 will be at (4,1)?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step by step.\n\n### Current State (Turn 22):\n- **Snake Positions**: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (head at (3,3), tail at (5,1))\n- **Head Direction**: R (right)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4, 1): value 1, life span 7 (currently under snake's body at (4,1))\n  - (4, 4): value 1, life span 10\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (3,3) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n1. **R (right)**: (4,3)\n   - (4,3) is free (not a wall or body).\n2. **U (up)**: (3,4)\n   - (3,4) is free.\n3. **D (down)**: (3,2)\n   - (3,2) is a body segment (collision).\n4. **L (left)**: (2,3)\n   - Not allowed (instant reverse from R).\n\nThus, valid moves are **R to (4,3)** or **U to (3,4)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Move R to (4,3):\n- New head: (4,3)\n- New body: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n- Tail: (4,1) (food is now under tail).\n- Next turn (23), head at (4,3), direction R. Possible moves:\n  - R to (5,3): free.\n  - U to (4,4): food at (4,4).\n  - D to (4,2): free.\n- If we move U to (4,4) at turn 23, we eat the food at (4,4), increasing length to 8.\n- Then, at turn 24, head at (4,4), direction U. Possible moves:\n  - U to (4,5): free.\n  - L to (3,4): body (collision).\n  - R to (5,4): free.\n- This path allows eating (4,4) safely.\n\n#### Move U to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- New body: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n- Tail: (4,1) (food under tail).\n- Next turn (23), head at (3,4), direction U. Possible moves:\n  - U to (3,5): free.\n  - L to (2,4): free.\n  - R to (4,4): food at (4,4).\n- If we move R to (4,4) at turn 23, we eat the food at (4,4), increasing length to 8.\n- Then, at turn 24, head at (4,4), direction R. Possible moves:\n  - R to (5,4): free.\n  - U to (4,5): free.\n  - D to (4,3): free.\n- This path also allows eating (4,4) safely.\n\n### Avoiding (4,1) Food:\nThe food at (4,1) is risky to eat because:\n- It is under the tail, and eating it requires moving the head to (4,1) when it is free.\n- After eating, the head would be at (4,1), and the new body segment would be adjacent (e.g., at (4,2)), causing a collision.\nThus, it is safer to avoid (4,1) and focus on (4,4).\n\n### Decision:\nBoth initial moves (R to (4,3) and U to (3,4)) allow safely eating (4,4) on the next turn. However, moving **U to (3,4)** is slightly better because:\n- It positions the snake closer to (4,4), making the path more straightforward.\n- It avoids potential complications with the (4,1) food.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nAt turn 22, the best immediate action is to move **U (up)** to (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 22. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since walls occupy x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body segments: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 7. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (4,1) is the 6th segment? Let's list them with indices:\n> \n> Index 0: head (3,3)\n> \n> Index 1: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 6: (5,1)  // tail\n> \n> So (4,1) is index 5, which is a body segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,1).\n> \n> Food at (4,1) has value 1, life span 7. But it's under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,4) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for food at (4,1), life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 turns, including turn 22. So it will be gone after turn 28? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 22, life span is 7, meaning:\n> \n> - After turn 22, life span becomes 6\n> \n> - After turn 23, life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 28, life span 0, and it disappears before turn 29? I need to be careful with the timing.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it's there for N more turns. But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown is L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if L=7 at turn 22, after turn 22 it becomes 6, after turn 23 it becomes 5, ..., after turn 28 it becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 29. So it can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 28 inclusive? No.\n> \n> The food is present as long as countdown > 0. So at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten during turn t as long as L >=1. After being eaten or when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it disappears at the end of the N-th turn or something. To simplify, since countdown decreases each turn, including current, food with life span L at turn t will be gone after t+L-1 or what?\n> \n> Let's assume: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. If it's not eaten during turn t, at the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, it can be eaten during turn t if the head moves to it.\n> \n> For (4,1): at turn 22, life span 7, so it can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 28? After turn 22, L=6; after turn 23, L=5; ... after turn 28, L=0, so it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when L >=1, i.e., turns 22 to 28 inclusive? Turn 28: if eaten on turn 28, L was 1 at start, decreases to 0 after.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now because the head isn't on it. The body needs to move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) has life span 10 at turn 22, so it will last until turn 31 or something.\n> \n> Life span 10: decreases each turn, so after turn 22, L=9; ... after turn 31, L=0, disappears. Can be eaten turns 22 to 31.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3), direction R. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R, U, D, but not L because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L. Allowed moves: R (continue right), U (up), D (down).\n> \n> Current position: head (3,3). Moving:\n> \n> - R: (4,3)\n> \n> - U: (3,4)\n> \n> - D: (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (3,2) is index 3, a body segment. Moving to (3,2) would cause collision because head touches body segment, except if it's the tail, but tail is (5,1), so (3,2) is not tail, so moving to (3,2) is death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body or wall is death.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y, but since playable area is 1-6, we don't go there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - R to (4,3): what is at (4,3)? Not in snake positions, not wall? Snake: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (4,3) is empty?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the head was, so the tail doesn't move; length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, if the food is under the tail, and head moves to that cell to eat it, but the tail is already there, so when head moves to (tail position), which has food, it eats it, then the new segment is added at the previous head position, so the tail remains where it is, and head is now at the food cell, which was the old tail position.\n> \n> But the snake segments: before move, tail is at P.\n> \n> Head moves to P to eat food at P.\n> \n> After move, head is at P, and new segment is added at old head position, so the segment that was tail is still at P, but now it's not tail, it's the second last segment, and new tail is the old segment before tail? Let's index.\n> \n> Suppose before move: positions ... , Q (body), P (tail)\n> \n> Head at H, adjacent to P.\n> \n> Head moves to P (since food at P).\n> \n> After eating, new head position is P, and a new segment is added at H, so the segments become: ..., Q, P (now body), H (new segment, tail?).\n> \n> New positions: the new head is at P.\n> \n> Then, the body includes the old tail P as a body segment now, and the new segment is at old head H, which becomes the new tail.\n> \n> But since head moved to P, and P was tail, now P is head, and the segment that was at P is still there, but it's not tail anymore; the tail is now at H.\n> \n> But H was head, and head moved to P, so old H is now new tail.\n> \n> Importantly, the head is at P, and the new tail is at H. Since H was adjacent to P, now head at P and tail at H are adjacent, but they are different cells, no collision.\n> \n> Collision would be if head touches any body segment except the tail, but tail is allowed since it moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> But when eating food at tail, it's different because tail doesn't move; it stays and a new segment is added.\n> \n> In this case, after eating food at tail position P:\n> \n> - Head moves to P\n> \n> - New segment added at old head position H\n> \n> - So the snake now has: head at P, then the old tail P is now a body segment (since new segment added), but P is occupied by head now, so the old tail segment is replaced or something? I think there's confusion.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the tail does not move, so the length increases. The cell that was food is now head, and the previous positions are shifted.\n> \n> Before move: segments: A-B-C-...-Y-Z, with Z tail, head A.\n> \n> Food at Z position.\n> \n> Head A moves to Z to eat food.\n> \n> After eating: new head at Z, and new segment added at A, so segments: Z (head), A (new segment), B, C, ..., Y, Z? No.\n> \n> The segments are: the new head is at Z, then the first body segment is at old A, then old B, old C, ..., up to old Y, and tail at old Z? But old Z is now head, so it's gone.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake body is a list of positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions [H, S1, S2, ..., St] with St tail.\n> \n> Food at position F.\n> \n> If head moves to F and F has food, then after move, new positions: [F, H, S1, S2, ..., St]  // new head at F, old head H becomes new body, and tail St remains, so length increased by one.\n> \n> If F was the tail position, i.e., F = St, then head moves to St, eats food, new positions: [St, H, S1, S2, ..., S_{t-1}, St] ? No, St is the position, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> Positions: before move, tail at St.\n> \n> Head moves to St to eat food at St.\n> \n> After eating, new head at St, new segment at old head H, so the body includes H, then S1, S2, ..., S_{t-1}, and tail at St? But St is occupied by head, so the tail should be the last body segment.\n> \n> List: new head position: St\n> \n> Then new body segments: position of old head H, then old S1, old S2, ..., old S_{t-1}, and then old St? But old St is the same as new head position, so it's not listed twice.\n> \n> The body segments are the old positions except the tail is not there if it moved, but since food eaten, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the new tail is the old second last segment or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions [ (1,1), (1,2) ] head at (1,1), tail at (1,2), food at (1,2).\n> \n> Head moves to (1,2) to eat food.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (1,2), and new segment added at old head (1,1), so new positions [ (1,2), (1,1) ] with head at (1,2), tail at (1,1).\n> \n> Now, head and tail are adjacent at (1,2) and (1,1), but not colliding.\n> \n> If the snake was longer, say [H, S1, S2] with S2 tail, food at S2.\n> \n> Head moves to S2, eats, new positions [S2, H, S1] with head S2, body H, tail S1.\n> \n> Head at S2, and body at H and S1. If S2 was adjacent to S1, now head at S2 and body at S1, which is adjacent, but S1 is a body segment, not tail, so head at S2 and body at S1, if they are adjacent, that's collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> In this case, S2 was tail, head moved to it, now head at S2, and the segment that was S1 is now the second last, but if S2 and S1 were adjacent, now head at S2 and body segment at S1, so if |S2 - S1| = 1, they are adjacent, head touches body, collision.\n> \n> That's the danger.\n> \n> In our case, for food at (4,1), which is currently body, but after move, it might be tail.\n> \n> Back to the state.\n> \n> At turn 22, head at (3,3), options: move R to (4,3) or U to (3,4).\n> \n> If move R to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head (4,3)\n> \n> - New body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // (4,1) is tail\n> \n> - (5,1) vacated\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is now under the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head (3,4)\n> \n> - New body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // (4,1) tail\n> \n> - (5,1) vacated\n> \n> Same for both moves, (4,1) becomes tail.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,1) can be eaten if the head moves to it when it's free, but it's currently occupied by tail.\n> \n> To eat it, the tail must move away first.\n> \n> In the next turn, if no food eaten, tail will move.\n> \n> For example, at turn 23, after this move, tail at (4,1).\n> \n> If at turn 23, head moves to (4,1), it can eat the food, but only if the tail has moved away or something.\n> \n> At turn 23, positions: let's say at turn 22 we moved R to (4,3), so at start of turn 23, positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is under tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (4,1) at turn 23, but (4,1) is occupied by tail, so moving there would be collision, unless it's allowed to move to tail position.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But when you move to tail, if there is food, you eat it only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule for food under body: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Specifically for tail: when head moves to tail position, it is allowed, and if there is food, it is eaten only if after the tail moves, the cell is free, but since head is moving to it at the same time, it's a bit tricky.\n> \n> Standard way: when head moves to a cell, if that cell has food, it is eaten.

(3,4) is y=4, (3,3) y=3, (2,3) x=2,y=3, (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) y=1, which is the border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is the bottom row, not a wall. Similarly, x=1 is left, x=6 is right? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are playable. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 playable.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). All these are between x=1-6 and y=1-6? x=2,3,4; y=1,2,3,4. y=1 is the bottom row, but since walls are y=0 and y=7, y=1 is inside, not a wall. Similarly, (3,1) and (4,1) are on y=1, which is fine.\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 6? The format is (x,y, life_span, value), I think. It says: (4,1,6,1) and (4,4,9,1). So (4,1) has value 1, life span 6; (4,4) has value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> But look at snake positions: the last segment is (4,1), and there's food at (4,1). (4,1) is occupied by the snake's tail, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So tail is (4,1).\n> \n> Food is at (4,1) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But the food is under the tail, right? Because the snake is on (4,1).\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (4,1), which is the tail position.\n> \n> Current head is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (4,1). Let's see the positions: head (3,4), tail (4,1). Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=3, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one cell away horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail right now.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,1) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn, so after turn 23 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will be there for N more turns? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,1), life_span=6 at turn 23. So on turn 23, life_span=6, then turn 24, life_span=5, ..., turn 28, life_span=1, then after turn 28, it disappears? \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for exactly N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so it can be eaten only if head moves to it this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, N=6: it will disappear after turn 23 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life_span=N. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn t, it has N, on turn t+1, it has N-1, ..., on turn t + (N-1), it has 1, and after turn t + (N-1), it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn t + (N-1).\n> \n> After N turns, meaning after turn t+N, it is gone. But since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn t, it has N, at turn t+1, it has N-1, ..., at turn t + (N-1), it has 1, and at turn t+N, it has 0, so it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1).\n> \n> For (4,1), at turn 23, life_span=6, so it can be eaten from turn 23 to turn 28 (since 23 to 28 is 6 turns: 23,24,25,26,27,28 – that's 6 opportunities).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life_span=9, can be eaten from turn 23 to turn 31.\n> \n> Now, head direction is U (up), so from (3,4), moving up would go to (3,5).\n> \n> But let's see possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head: (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U (up, same direction), L (left), R (right). Not D.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders, so x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake body: positions [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> So the snake occupies: (3,4) head, (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) which is currently occupied by tail, and (4,4) which is free.\n> \n> (4,4) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: (3,4) head, then (3,3), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n> \n> (4,1) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 23.\n> \n> From (3,4), with head U, I can move:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Not D.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied or wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,5) is within bounds. Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). (3,5) not in list, so free? But I need to see if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> After moving, the head moves to new position, then the body follows, so the tail moves away, etc.\n> \n> But when I move head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, wall collision.\n> \n> So for (3,5): not wall, not in body positions except possibly tail, but tail is at (4,1), far away. So moving to (3,5) is safe.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (2,4): (2,4) not in snake positions? Snake has (2,3) and (2,2), but (2,4) is not listed, so should be free. Walls ok.\n> \n> R to (4,4): (4,4) not in snake positions, walls ok. And there's food at (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) has food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,4), I eat the food, since it's positive, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new tail position is still the old tail, but since we add a segment, the tail stays where it is? Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> When snake eats food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move that turn. The snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose snake is [head, body..., tail]. Head moves to new cell, if it eats food, then the tail remains, so new positions: [new_head, old_head, body..., tail] — since tail stays, it grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,4), which has food, I eat it, so head is now at (4,4), and the tail (4,1) remains, so snake becomes: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] — positions list adds the new head, tail stays.\n> \n> Length increases by one.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so length same.\n> \n> Back to choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (4,4) — eat food immediately, get +1, grow to length 8.\n> \n> Then head is at (4,4), and direction was U, but after moving R, new direction is R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But there's also the food at (4,1) under the tail, which might be eaten later if possible.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,1), and if I move to (4,4), head is at (4,4), tail at (4,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> But later, if head gets close to tail and tail has food, it could be dangerous.\n> \n> Now, for turn 23, I have three choices: U, L, R.\n> \n> R: to (4,4), eat food.\n> \n> U: to (3,5), no food.\n> \n> L: to (2,4), no food.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) has life span 9, so it can be eaten later, but since it's there, and I can eat it now, might be good.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,1) under tail. To eat that, I need the body to move away from (4,1), then head move to it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,1). When the snake moves, the tail will move only if no food is eaten. If I don't eat food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a direction not eating food, tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> If I move head to (3,5) without eating, then new positions: head to (3,5), then body: (3,4) becomes new segment 1, (3,3) seg2, (2,3) seg3, (2,2) seg4, (3,2) seg5, (3,1) seg6, and tail (4,1) moves to where? When head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,5), then:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment1 (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment2 (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment3 (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old segment4 (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old segment5 (3,1)\n> \n> - Tail: old segment6 (4,1)?

So it disappears after turn 32.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns, starting from turn 24. Since I should think 5+ turns ahead, I'll plan for at least turns 24 to 29 or so.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls, and (5,2) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (3,5)\n> - Body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // so tail at (3,1)\n> \n> Food at (4,1) and (4,4).\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving up. That means I cannot move down (D) on the next turn because of the no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (3,5) are: Up (U) to (3,6), Left (L) to (2,5), or Right (R) to (4,5). Down is not allowed because it's opposite to current U.\n> \n> (3,6): y=6, which is not a wall since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is valid. Similarly, (2,5) and (4,5) should be valid, but I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves for turn 24:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are occupied by body or walls.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,6): x=3 between 1-6, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not wall. (2,5): similar. (4,5): similar.\n> \n> Body positions: (3,5) is head, so body is (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). None of these are (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5). So all three moves are safe for now.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food: (4,1) and (4,4). (4,1) is at y=1, which is low, and (4,4) is at y=4.\n> \n> (4,1) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 29 (since current turn 24, life span 5, so after 5 turns: 24,25,26,27,28, gone by 29). Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 24, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one. So after turn 24, it has 4 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, with life span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown to N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t+(N-1), countdown to 0, so it disappears before turn t+N.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it will last until the end of turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For (4,1): at turn 24, life span 5, so it will be present on turns 24,25,26,27,28. Disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): life span 8, present until turn 31 (24+7=31? Turn 24: L=8, after turn 24: L=7, ..., after turn 31: L=0, disappear at turn 32. So present turns 24 to 31 inclusive.\n> \n> But I need to eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> Now, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is near the tail. Tail is at (3,1), so (4,1) is adjacent to tail? (3,1) and (4,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> There's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> (4,1) has food, but it's not on the tail cell. The tail cell is (3,1), which has no food mentioned. Food is at (4,1), separate cell.\n> \n> The rule says: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Here, tail cell is (3,1), no food there. Food is at (4,1), which is adjacent to tail but not on the tail.\n> \n> So eating (4,1) should be fine, as long as head moves to it when it's free.\n> \n> But (4,1) is occupied? No, snake positions are given, food is separate. So (4,1) is not occupied by snake; it's a food cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). So (4,1) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is free.\n> \n> Now, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is adjacent to tail (3,1). But since the food is not on the tail, eating it shouldn't cause tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if the food is on the tail cell itself and head is adjacent.\n> \n> Here, food is at (4,1), tail at (3,1), so different cells.\n> \n> So I can eat (4,1) by moving to (4,1) when possible.\n> \n> Now, let's plan moves.\n> \n> First, I should consider going for food, but with long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall, so I can't go there.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), moving up.\n> \n> Possible actions turn 24: U, L, R (not D).\n> \n> If I go U to (3,6), that's towards the top. But y=6, and wall at y=7, so I might be cornering myself.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is closer to food (4,4), which is below at (4,4).\n> \n> (4,5) to (4,4) is down, but if I go to (4,5), then from there I can go down to (4,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think about the path and the snake body.\n> \n> List the snake body: positions in order: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail.\n> \n> So the snake is currently forming a sort of U-shape or something. From (3,5) down to (3,4), down to (3,3), left to (2,3), down to (2,2), right to (3,2), down to (3,1). So it's like a path that went down, left, down, right, down.\n> \n> Now, if I move, the tail will move when I eat food, but since I'm not eating now, moving without eating, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> When I move to a new cell without eating, the head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so snake shortens? No: in Snake, when you move without eating, the head moves to new cell, and tail moves, so the last segment is removed, but length stays the same.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you move, head moves to adjacent cell, and tail end is removed, so length unchanged unless you eat.\n> \n> When you eat, head moves to food, and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, since no food eaten, when I move, head goes to new position, and the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So after move, new positions: for example, if I go U to (3,6), new head (3,6), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). Tail was (3,1), but removed, so new tail is (3,2)? Let's see the list.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, say (3,6), so new positions: head (3,6), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). The last segment (3,1) is gone, and (3,2) is now the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L to (2,5), new head (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). Tail (3,1) gone.\n> \n> Go R to (4,5), new head (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (3,1) gone, but (3,2) becomes tail? Positions: after move, head to (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes first body, and so on, up to (3,2), and (3,1) removed. So body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail at (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is now the tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) and (4,4).\n> \n> (4,1) has short life, only 5 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> But (4,1) is at y=1, and tail is moving, but currently tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent.\n> \n> If I go to (4,5) on turn 24, then I can go down to (4,4) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (4,4) is food, so if I move to (4,4), I eat it, length increases.\n> \n> Let's simulate turn by turn.\n> \n> First, for turn 24, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Option 1: Go U to (3,6)\n> \n> Then head at (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail.\n> \n> Then from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.

Head is at (4,5), so (4,4) is one cell down, but (4,4) has food, and it's also occupied by the snake body? Snake body has (3,4), (3,3), etc., but (4,4) is not listed in snake positions. Snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So (4,4) is not occupied by snake; it's free with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is free, (3,6) is free.\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6. Snake has (3,5) and (3,4), but not (3,6), so it's free.\n> \n> Head is at (4,5), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move R (right), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse.

Walls: x=7 is border, x=5 is within 1-6, y=5 within 1-6. Obstacle at (5,2), so (5,5) should be free. Snake body: positions are (3,5), (3,4), etc., no (5,5), so (5,5) is empty? But (5,5) might be a valid cell.\n> \n> List all cells around head (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) - y=6, which is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable. Snake body? No, snake is at (4,5) head, (3,5), etc., not (4,6). So (4,6) is free.\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) - y=4, within bounds. And there's food at (4,4) with value 1. But is it safe? (4,4) is not occupied by snake body; snake body has (3,4) at x=3,y=4, not (4,4). So (4,4) is free with food.\n> \n> - Left: (3,5) - but (3,5) is the body segment directly behind the head.

So cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right: (5,5) - as above, should be free.\n> \n> So possible actions from (4,5): U, D, R.\n> \n> U: to (4,6)\n> \n> D: to (4,4) with food\n> \n> R: to (5,5)\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food and their life spans.\n> \n> Food at (4,1): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 28, it's gone. Since current turn is 25, it has 4 turns including turn 25? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span is 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one. So it will be present for turns 25,26,27,28, and disappear at the start of turn 29? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,1): life_span = 4 at turn 25. After turn 25, countdown to 3; after turn 26, to 2; after turn 27, to 1; after turn 28, to 0, so it disappears before turn 29. So it can be eaten on turns 25,26,27,28.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life_span=7 at turn 25, so it will last until turn 31 (since 25+7-1=31? Countdown: start at 7, after t25:6, t26:5, ..., t31:0, disappear before t32. So can be eaten until t31.\n> \n> (3,6) life_span=10, lasts until turn 34.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,5), and (4,4) has food directly below. If I move down to (4,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 8 segments, and the new head is at (4,4), and the tail will move accordingly.\n> \n> But I need to check for risks. After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move immediately? No, in snake, when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, and next turn when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So length increases by one, and the new position of tail remains until the next move.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, when you move to a food cell, you don't die if it was occupied because it's food, but in this case, (4,4) is not occupied by body, so moving down to (4,4) should be safe.\n> \n> Now, after moving down, head is at (4,4), direction down.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> First, I should consider the food at (4,4) because it's close and has shorter life? No, (4,4) has life span 7, plenty of time, while (4,1) has only 4 turns left, so it might be more urgent to get to (4,1) if possible.\n> \n> (4,1) is at y=1, head at y=5, so it's 4 units away vertically, so I need at least 4 moves to reach it, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Path to (4,1): from (4,5) to (4,4) is down, but (4,4) has food, so if I go down to (4,4), I eat it, then from (4,4) to (4,3), but (4,3) is what? Is it free?\n> \n> Current snake positions: (4,5) head, then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So (4,3) is not occupied, but let's see what's there. No food mentioned, so probably empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2), (4,1) has food.\n> \n> But there's an obstacle at (5,2), which might affect paths.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (3,2), which might move.\n> \n> First, if I don't eat anything, the snake moves, tail moves.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (3,6), which is above, at (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6, head is at (4,5), so to reach (3,6), I could go left and up, but left is blocked by body, so from (4,5), I can go up to (4,6), then left to (3,6), but (3,6) is food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> (4,6) is free, as I thought earlier.\n> \n> Now, let's list all food and their positions relative to head:\n> \n> - (4,4): distance 1 down, can be eaten in 1 move\n> \n> - (3,6): distance: from (4,5) to (3,6) is |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so Manhattan distance 2, can be eaten in 2 moves if path clear. Path: via (4,6) or (3,5), but (3,5) is body, so only via (4,6) then left to (3,6).\n> \n> - (4,1): distance |dx=0, dy=4|, so Manhattan 4, at least 4 moves, but with snake body, might be longer.\n> \n> Now, (4,1) has short life, only 4 turns including this one, so if I don't eat it by turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Turn 25: if I move towards it, I might reach it by turn 28 or 29, but turn 28 is the last chance.\n> \n> Current turn 25, moves: turn 25,26,27,28 to eat it.\n> \n> From (4,5), to reach (4,1), I need to go down 4 times, but (4,4) has food, so if I go down to (4,4) on turn 25, I eat it, then head at (4,4), then I can go down to (4,3) on turn 26, to (4,2) on turn 27, to (4,1) on turn 28, just in time.\n> \n> But when I go to (4,1) on turn 28, I eat it, and snake grows.\n> \n> But are there risks?\n> \n> First, when I move down to (4,4) on turn 25: head to (4,4), which is safe, no collision. Then snake grows to 8 segments. Positions: new head (4,4), previous head (4,5) becomes body, so body now: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and tail is still (3,2) since we added a segment, so tail doesn't move. On eat, tail stays, so positions after turn 25: head (4,4), body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — tail (3,2) remains.\n> \n> (3,2) is the tail, and it will move on the next turn when the snake moves.\n> \n> Now turn 26: I move down to (4,3). (4,3) should be free? Current occupied: after turn 25, cells: (4,4) head, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So (4,3) is not occupied, and no wall or obstacle, so moving to (4,3) is safe. Direction down.\n> \n> Snake moves to (4,3), head now (4,3), tail moves from (3,2) to... when snake moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment or something. Standard: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, tail moves away.\n> \n> After move to (4,3) on turn 26: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — and tail (2,2) since (3,2) is no longer part, tail moved to (2,2)? Positions: before move: head (4,4), body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — (3,2) is tail.\n> \n> When moving down to (4,3): head to (4,3), then the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was?

It's turn 26. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving down to (4,4) from (4,5)? Let's see the positions: the list is head first, so (4,4) is head, then (4,5) is the next segment. If head is at (4,4) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (4,4), so previous head was at (4,5) or something? Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), ...] so head is at (4,4), and the segment behind it is (4,5). Since direction is down, moving down would mean from (4,5) to (4,4), which is decreasing y? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up, but let's see the movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – so if U increases y, that might mean up if y=0 is bottom, but often in such games, y=0 is top. I need to be careful.\n> \n> The wall cells: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. And food positions given as (x,y, life_span, value), so for example (4,1,3,1) and (3,6,9,1).\n> \n> But for movement: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y). So if y+1 is up, then y decreases down, meaning y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? Let's see from snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4). If it moves U, it goes to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, in the list, after head (4,4) is (4,5), which is directly above if y increases up, or below if y increases down. Since U is (x,y+1), let's assume that (x,y) with U to (x,y+1) means y+1 is north or up. Similarly, D to (x,y-1) is south or down.\n> \n> In the positions: head at (4,4), next segment at (4,5). Since the snake was moving, and head direction is D (down), but if head is at (4,4) and direction is down, that means it just moved down to (4,4). Before that, head was at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4), so (4,5) is now the second segment. Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> So coordinates: let's define (0,0) as top-left, x increasing right, y increasing down. That's common in such grids. So U: (x, y-1) if y increases down? No.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) – if y increases down, U would be (x, y+1) meaning down? That can't be right because U is up.\n> \n> I think there might be inconsistency. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`\" – it says U: (x,y+1)\n> \n> But in standard notation, if y=0 is top, moving up should decrease y, but here U: (x,y+1) would increase y, meaning down if y increases down.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (x,y-1) would decrease y, meaning up.\n> \n> That seems reversed. Perhaps y increases upwards?\n> \n> But let's look at the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), next at (4,5). Head direction is D (down). If head moved down to (4,4), from where? From (4,5)? But (4,5) has higher y, so if y increases down, (4,5) is below (4,4), so moving down from (4,5) to (4,4) would be moving up, which is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are given with head first, so (4,4) is current head, (4,5) is the segment that was head before, which is now behind. Since direction is down, the snake was moving down, so from previous position, head was at (4,5), moved down to (4,4), so (4,5) is now the neck or second segment. And (4,5) has higher y than (4,4), so y increases as we go down. So U: (x,y+1) means down, because y+1 increases y, which is downward. D: (x,y-1) means up, decreasing y.\n> \n> But that would mean U is down and D is up, which is opposite to common sense. But in the movement constraints, it says \"U (x,y+1)\", so I have to go with that.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> So for this grid, with walls at y=0 and y=7, and x=0, x=7.\n> \n> If y increases down, then y=0 is top row, y=7 is bottom row.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) - move down to higher y\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) - move up to lower y\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) - left\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) - right\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, but D is (x,y-1), which is up if y increases down. I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Let's clarify with an example.\n> \n> Suppose at position (4,4), moving U: to (4,5) - which is down if y increases down.\n> \n> Moving D: to (4,3) - up.\n> \n> But direction is given as D, which is down, but in terms of movement, D action moves to (x,y-1), which is decreasing y, so upwards if y increases down.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction the snake was moving when it arrived at the current head position. So at turn 26, head is at (4,4), and it moved there by going down, so from previous position (4,5) to (4,4), so moving down means decreasing y if y increases down? Let's set a coordinate system.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is top-left corner.\n> \n> x increases right, y increases down.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) - moves down (increases y)\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) - moves up (decreases y)\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) - left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) - right\n> \n> Now, head at (4,4), direction D. D means down, but in this system, D action is (x,y-1), which is up. Contradiction.\n> \n> The direction is the direction the snake is facing or the last move direction.\n> \n> It says \"Snake Head Direction\": D, which is the direction it was moving to get to (4,4).\n> \n> Since it moved to (4,4) with direction D, and positions show previous head at (4,5), so from (4,5) to (4,4), which is a decrease in y, so moving up if y increases down. But D is down, so it's inconsistent.\n> \n> Perhaps the movement definitions are mislabeled.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) - if y increases down, this is down, but U is usually up.\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in my assumption.\n> \n> Perhaps in this grid, y increases upwards.\n> \n> Let's check the food positions or something.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) and (3,6). Walls at y=0 and y=7. If y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa.\n> \n> But the problem doesn't specify, so I need to go by the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U: (x,y+1)\n> \n> D: (x,y-1)\n> \n> L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y)\n> \n> And head direction D.\n> \n> From snake positions, head at (4,4), previous at (4,5). Since it moved from (4,5) to (4,4), and that was a move in the direction of head, which is D.\n> \n> So from (4,5) to (4,4), the change is (0, -1) in (x,y), so dy = -1.\n> \n> For move D: (x,y-1), so dy = -1, which matches moving to lower y.\n> \n> If y increases down, lower y is up, so D is up.\n> \n> But the label \"D\" is for down, which is confusing.\n> \n> Similarly, U: (x,y+1), dy=+1, down if y increases down.\n> \n> So in this system, U is down, D is up.\n> \n> But the direction is called \"down\" for D, but it means moving to lower y, which is up.\n> \n> I think it's better not to think in terms of up/down but in terms of the actions as defined.\n> \n> For the purpose of movement, I'll use the actions as given: U, D, L, R with the coordinate changes.\n> \n> So from (x,y):\n> \n> - U: to (x, y+1)\n> \n> - D: to (x, y-1)\n> \n> - L: to (x-1, y)\n> \n> - R: to (x+1, y)\n> \n> And head direction is D, so it just moved to (4,4) with action D, from (4,5).\n> \n> Now, for the next move, I can choose U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Instant reverse would be moving opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, since U and D are opposites.\n> \n> L and R are perpendicular.\n> \n> So I cannot move U next, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves from current position and direction: not U, so D, L, R are possible, but D is (x,y-1), to (4,3), U is (x,y+1) to (4,5), but U is forbidden because reverse.\n> \n> Possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> D: to (4,3)\n> \n> L: to (3,4)\n> \n> R: to (5,4)\n> \n> But need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,3): x=4, y=3, y=3 is between 0 and 7, not wall unless y=0 or 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=3 is fine. Similarly, x=4 fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,4) is different.\n> \n> Now, snake body: current positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> So body segments are (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> If I move to (4,3), is that occupied?

Possible moves: D, L, R (cannot reverse to U).\n   - D to (4,2): Safe, no collision, sets up to eat (4,1) next turn.\n   - L to (3,3): Collision with body (deadly).\n   - R to (5,3): Safe but misses (4,1) food, less optimal for immediate score.\n\n2. **Food Priority**: \n   - (4,1): Life span 2 (available on Turns 27-28), +1 score. Must eat now or next turn.\n   - (3,6): Life span 8 (available until Turn 34), can be pursued later.\n\n3. **Safety**: Moving D to (4,2) is safe (no walls/obstacles, no body collision). Next move D to (4,1) is also safe (no tail reward danger; tail is at (2,3), not adjacent to (4,1)).\n\n4. **Long-Term Plan**: After eating (4,1), navigate left/up to reach (3,6) while avoiding dead ends.\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is \\boxed{D}.",

The snake has 8 segments.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down). That means from the previous position, it moved down to (4,3). Let me trace the positions: from (4,4) to (4,3) is down, yes.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases each turn, including current, it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is given as 2 at turn 27, so after this turn, it becomes 1, and then after next turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28, but not after that.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 27, life span is 2, meaning:\n> \n> - Turn 27: life span 2 (can be eaten)\n> \n> - After turn 27, life span becomes 1\n> \n> - Turn 28: life span 1 (can be eaten)\n> \n> - After turn 28, life span becomes 0, disappears, so not available on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food: (3,6) with value 1 and life span 8.

Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=2 is fine, x=4 fine. But is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> But snake body: is (4,2) occupied? Snake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). So (4,2) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: not a wall cell.\n> \n> So moving to (4,2) is possible.\n> \n> But (4,2) is below (4,3), and y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the context, walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: head at (4,3), and moving down to (4,3) from (4,4)? Positions: (4,4) to (4,3) is down, so y decreasing is down? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So y increases upward, decreases downward. So bottom is y=0, top is y=7? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row? But typically, we think y=0 at bottom, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: from head (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5), so (4,5) has higher y, so if U is (x,y+1), y+1 is upward, so (4,4) to (4,5) is up? But the positions are listed head first: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ...] so from head to body, (4,3) then (4,4), which is up from (4,3) to (4,4)? (4,3) to (4,4) is +y, which is up.\n> \n> But current head direction is D, down. Head at (4,3), and direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (4,3) from where? Previous position: the list is [(4,3), (4,4), ...], so before moving to (4,3), it was at (4,4), and moved down to (4,3). Yes.\n> \n> So now, from (4,3), moving down would be to (4,2), which is y=2.\n> \n> y=1 is above y=0? y=0 is border, so y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so the playable y are 1 to 6. y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Since y=0 is wall, and U is y+1, so from y=1, U to y=2, etc., up to y=6, then y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly for x: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 playable.\n> \n> x from left to right, I assume.\n> \n> So grid: bottom-left (1,1), top-right (6,6), but with obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is x=5, y=2.\n> \n> Now back to moves.\n> \n> From head (4,3), current dir D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (4,2)\n> \n> - L: to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,3)\n> \n> Cannot U, reverse.\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> First, (4,2): is it free? Snake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). So (4,2) not occupied. Walls: not border, not obstacle (obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2)). So (4,2) is empty and safe to move to.\n> \n> But there is food at (4,1), which is below (4,2)? (4,1) is at y=1, which is the bottom row.\n> \n> Moving to (4,2) doesn't eat food, unless food is there, but food is at (4,1), not (4,2).\n> \n> Second, move L: to (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), ... so (3,3) is the 6th segment? List: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> So (3,3) is occupied by the snake body at position 5.\n> \n> If I move to (3,3), that would be head colliding with body, which is deadly. So cannot move left to (3,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Moving to (3,3) would be head at (3,3), but (3,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. Except that when the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I move to a cell that was the tail, it might be ok, but here (3,3) is not the tail; tail is at (2,2). (3,3) is a body segment that will still be there after move.\n> \n> General rule: after moving, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves away from its position, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, but other body cells remain.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is not the tail and is occupied, it collides.\n> \n> Here, (3,3) is position 5, which is not the tail; tail is (2,2). After move, if head moves to (3,3), the segment that was at (3,3) will move to where? Depending on the move.\n> \n> But at the moment of move, if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. But if it moves to the current tail position, it might be ok because the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail cell is safe only if it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (2,2). So moving to (3,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, move L to (3,3) is invalid, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (5,3): (5,3) is x=5,y=3.\n> \n> Is it occupied? Snake positions: no (5,3). Walls: not border, obstacle at (5,2), not (5,3), so (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: internal obstacle is only (5,2), so (5,3) is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,2) or R to (5,3). L is invalid.\n> \n> Now, also, there is food at (4,1) and (3,6).\n> \n> (4,1) is below, at y=1.\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, top-left? y=6 is top row.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) has short life span, only until turn 28.\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving down to (4,2).\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2), then head at (4,2), and snake becomes: new head (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, and tail (2,2) moves away? After move, the snake: head moves to (4,2), then the body follows: the segment behind head was (4,4)? Positions: after moving head to (4,2), the body segments: the first body segment moves to the old head position (4,3), then next to (4,4), and so on, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, but since no food, tail moves, so the last segment (2,2) is removed, and new tail is where (2,3) was or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So here, current positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ]\n> \n> If head moves to (4,2), then new positions: head at (4,2), then body: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) ] and tail (2,2) is removed.

So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Current turn: t1 = 28.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), and the body segments are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down (D). Since the head is at (4,2) and direction is D, that means it's moving down, so from the previous position, it came to (4,2) from above, but since direction is given as current head direction, for movement, I need to choose the next move based on this.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life_span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 28, life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 28 if not eaten. Since we're at turn 28, if I move to it this turn, I can eat it, but if not, it will be gone next turn.\n> \n> Life_span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,1), life_span=1 at turn 28, so after turn 28, it will be gone. That means if I don't eat it on turn 28, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life_span=7. So it will last until turn 28 + 7 - 1? Countdown: at turn t, life_span decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn 28, life_span=7, so it decreases to 6 on turn 29, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it will be there for 7 more turns including turn 28? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think \"including current\" means that at the start of turn t, the life_span is the value given, and at the end of the turn, it decreases. But for eating, when the head moves to the cell, it eats the food at that moment.\n> \n> The rule says: \"food can be eaten if the head moves onto the food cell.\" So during the turn when the head moves to the cell, it eats it.\n> \n> Also, life_span: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think N is the number of turns it exists, starting from the turn it spawns.\n> \n> But in the state, at turn t1, we have the current life_span.\n> \n> For (4,1): value=1, life_span=1. So at turn 28, life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So if not eaten on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> For (3,6): value=1, life_span=7, so it will decrease over the next 7 turns, disappearing after turn 34 or something? Let's calculate: at turn 28, life_span=7. After turn 28, it decreases to 6. After turn 29, to 5, ..., after turn 34, it would be 0 and disappear, so it can be eaten from turn 28 to 34 inclusive? Turn 28 to turn 34 is 7 turns, life_span from 7 to 1, and on turn 35 it disappears? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is L at turn t, it will last for L more turns, including the current turn. So it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L or something.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's simpler: at the beginning of each turn, the life_span is checked; if it's 0, it disappears before the turn starts. But since it decreases including current, let's assume that for food with life_span L at turn t, it will be present until the end of turn t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (4,1): life_span=1 at turn 28, so it will disappear after turn 28, meaning if not eaten on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,6): life_span=7 at turn 28, so it will last until turn 34 (since 28 to 34 is 7 turns), disappear after turn 34.\n> \n> Turn 28: life_span=7, after turn 28: life_span=6, ..., after turn 34: life_span=0, disappear at start of turn 35? I think for simplicity, we can say the food is available for L turns starting from current turn.\n> \n> But in terms of decision, for (4,1), I must eat it this turn or lose it.\n> \n> Another food: (4,5) with value=1, life_span=10. But (4,5) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (4,5), which is the 4th segment.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) with value=1, life_span=10. But the snake is on that cell? How can food spawn under the snake?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So food at (4,5) is under the snake's body segment. To eat it, I need to move the body away first, then later move the head there.\n> \n> But since the snake is moving, if I move such that the tail moves away from (4,5), then the cell becomes empty, and I can move the head there to eat the food, but only if the food hasn't disappeared.\n> \n> Also, life_span=10, so it has plenty of time.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (2,3), and head at (4,2). Are they adjacent? Let's see positions.\n> \n> Head (4,2), tail (2,3). Distance: |4-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (4,2) to (2,3) is not adjacent; (4,2) to (4,3) is adjacent, but (4,3) is the second segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,3). Head is at (4,2). Possible adjacent cells to head: up (4,3), down (4,1), left (3,2), right (5,2). But (5,2) has a wall? Walls: internal obstacle at (5,2), and borders.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So (5,2) is an internal wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is within bounds? y=1, not y=0, so accessible.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is y=1, not wall.\n> \n> Now, back to tail: tail at (2,3), which is not adjacent to head (4,2). So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n> \n> Current head direction is Down, meaning last move was down to (4,2).\n> \n> From the positions: snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3)]\n> \n> So the head is at (4,2), and it moved down to there, so previous head was at (4,1)? But (4,1) has food? Positions are head first, so from turn 27, head was at (4,1) or something? Let's infer movement.\n> \n> At turn 28, positions given. Head at (4,2), direction D, meaning it was moving down, so from (4,1) to (4,2) or from (4,3) to (4,2)? Direction is the current head direction, which is the direction it moved to get to current position.\n> \n> Typically, head direction is the direction of the last move.\n> \n> So if head is at (4,2) and direction D, it means it moved down to (4,2), so previous head was at (4,1) or (4,3)? Down means decreasing y or increasing? Coordinate: usually in grids, y increases up or down?\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upward, decreases downward. Like Cartesian with origin at bottom left? But in programming, often y=0 at top, y increasing down, but here U is (x,y+1), which might be up if y=0 is top, or down if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> Let's see the movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, with food at (4,1), etc.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume the grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with (0,0) probably bottom-left or top-left? But for movement, it doesn't matter, as long as we know the coordinates.\n> \n> For example, head at (4,2), move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n> \n> But (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot move to those.\n> \n> Now, current possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - U: to (4,3) – but (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, second segment. Moving there would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - D: to (4,1) – (4,1) has food with value +1, and life_span 1, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> - L: to (3,2) – is this empty? Let's see snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3). So (3,2) is not in the list, and not a wall, so it should be empty.\n> \n> - R: to (5,2) – but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so I cannot move U on the next turn, as it would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Possible actions: from above, U is invalid because reverse and also occupied? Reverse is not allowed, but even if it were, it's occupied.\n> \n> D is possible, to (4,1), which has food.\n> \n> L is possible, to (3,2), empty.\n> \n> R is not possible, wall.\n> \n> So only D or L are possible moves this turn.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,1), I eat the food: +1 score, snake length increases by 1, so new length 9. And the food is eaten, so it's gone.\n> \n> Then the snake positions: new head at (4,1), body: the tail stays? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to (4,1) and eating, new positions: head at (4,1), then the previous head (4,2) becomes second segment, (4,3) third, and so on, up to (2,3) is now the 8th segment, and since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so new tail at (2,3), so positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3)] with new segment at end.\n> \n> After moving, the segments shift: the tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to new cell (with food), each body segment moves as above, but a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,1) and eat, new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2) from old head, (4,3) from second, (4,4) from third, (4,5) from fourth, (3,5) from fifth, (3,4) from sixth, (3,3) from seventh, and (2,3) from eighth, and since eaten, add new segment at old tail position, which was (2,3), so new tail at (2,3), but (2,3) is already there, so positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3)] with (2,3) being the tail.\n> \n> The tail position is fixed when food eaten.\n> \n> Now, if I move L to (3,2), no food, so head to (3,2), body: (4,2) to (4,3), (4,3) to (4,4), ..., up to (2,3) moves to (3,3)? Let's trace:\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (3,2), no food eaten.\n> \n> New head: (3,2)\n> \n> New body: segment 1 moves to old head (4,2), segment 2 moves to old seg1 (4,3), segment 3 to old seg2 (4,4), segment 4 to old seg3 (4,5), segment 5 to old seg4 (3,5), segment 6 to old seg5 (3,4), segment 7 to old seg6 (3,3), and tail old seg7 (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] with tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Old seg7 was (2,3), which is not part of new snake, so tail is now (3,3).\n> \n> And (2,3) is empty.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> At turn 28, I can move D to (4,1) and eat the food, or L to (3,2) no eat.\n> \n> But the food at (4,1) will disappear after this turn, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,6) and (4,5), but (4,5) is under the snake body.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (4,1).\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1), eat food, snake grows to 9 segments.\n> \n> New head at (4,1), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) – but (4,2) is now the second segment, occupied, collision.\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) – but y=0 is wall, collision.\n> \n> - L: to (3,1) – is this empty?

It's turn 29, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake's positions are: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3). So the head is at (4,1), and the tail is at (2,3). The snake is moving downward, as per the head direction \"D\".\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6), it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn, so it will be gone by turn 29 + 6 = 35? Let me clarify: life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 29, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 34 (since turn 29: life=6, turn 30:5, ..., turn 34:1, turn 35: gone? But life span is given as the remaining turns, I think.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 6 at turn 29, it will be available until turn 29 + 6 - 1? No.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = N\n> \n> - After turn t, it decreases to N-1\n> \n> - So it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Life span N means it has N turns left including the current one? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after this turn, it becomes L-1. If L=1, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 29, life span 6 for (3,6) means:\n> \n> - After turn 29, life span becomes 5\n> \n> - After turn 30, life span 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 34, life span becomes 0 and it disappears, so it's not available from turn 35 onwards.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5) with life span 9: after turn 29, life span 8, ..., disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,5): but (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake! Let's see the snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ... so (4,5) is the 5th segment of the snake.\n> \n> But the food is listed at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> This is a special case: food can spawn under the snake's body. But it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 29, the head is at (4,1), moving down. So to eat the food at (4,5), the snake needs to move such that the segment at (4,5) is no longer there when the head arrives, but since the snake moves one cell at a time, the body will move, so if the head can get to (4,5) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> But (4,5) is part of the body now. Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The snake moves: each turn, the head moves to a new position, and the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> So, if the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, grows by one, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But for food under the body, it's tricky.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all positions.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).

Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is different cell, so (5,1) should be free? (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,1) is above it, so should be free unless specified.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

So the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). So that's 9 segments. Head at (3,1), direction is L, which is left, so moving left.\n> \n> Food: one at (3,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive). Another at (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive). Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> (4,5) is listed as food, but (4,5) is also part of the snake body? Let's see snake positions: positions are [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]. So (4,5) is the 6th segment, which is the body. But food can spawn under the body, as per rules. So (4,5) has food on it, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is a free cell, I think. Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but since it's cells, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is obstacle, so not passable.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,6) and (4,5). (4,5) is currently occupied by snake body, so food is under it, but can't be eaten yet. (3,6) is at y=6, which is not wall? y=6 is playable? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's within 1 to 6. Similarly, x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 are playable, y=7 wall. Similarly for x.\n> \n> So (3,6) is a valid cell, and currently no snake there, so food is accessible.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. So at turn 30, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 34? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, it might be that at the start of turn, countdown decreases, and if 0, food is gone before the turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, let's assume that during turn t, if life_span is L, it will be there for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so disappears after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn 30, life_span=5, so it will be available on turns 30,31,32,33,34? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 30, countdown=5, so it can be eaten on turn 30.\n> \n> After turn 30, countdown becomes 4, so available turn 31, and so on, until after turn 34, countdown would be 0, so not available on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,5) life_span=8, so available from turn 30 to 37.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), direction L (left), so current possible moves: since direction is L, cannot instantly reverse to R, but can go U, D, or continue L.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L (since L is current direction), R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Current position: head (3,1), moving left.\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2)\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (2,1)\n> \n> - Right: (4,1) but (4,1) is the second segment of snake, so body collision if move there.\n> \n> Moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is at (3,3), I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3) so tail is (3,3).\n> \n> If head moves to (4,1), which is occupied by body segment, it will collide and die, even though (4,1) is not tail.\n> \n> Only if moving to the tail cell and tail moves away, it's safe. But here, (4,1) is not tail.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - U: to (3,2). Is this safe? (3,2) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). So (3,2) is not in list, so empty? Also, not wall, y=2 is between 1 and 6, x=3 between 1 and 6, not obstacle.\n> \n> (5,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is fine.\n> \n> - D: to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (2,1). (2,1) is x=2, y=1, not wall, not occupied? Snake at (3,1), (4,1), etc., no (2,1), so empty.\n> \n> - R: to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food available: (3,6) with life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 34. (4,5) with life span 8, by turn 37.\n> \n> But (4,5) is under snake body, so need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (3,3), and there might be a danger with tail reward.\n> \n> First, let's plan a path to eat the foods safely.\n> \n> I should aim for (3,6) first since it has shorter life span, 5 turns left, so by turn 34.\n> \n> Current turn 30, so I have 5 turns to eat it: turns 30,31,32,33,34.\n> \n> If I eat it on turn 34, it's the last chance.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has longer life.\n> \n> But (4,5) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> Current head at (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,1), then head at (2,1), direction L.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) invalid (wall), L to (1,1), R to (3,1) but (3,1) will be body? After moving, the snake moves, so tail moves.\n> \n> I need to simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Let me denote the snake: segments S0 to S8, S0 head (3,1), S1 (4,1), S2 (4,2), S3 (4,3), S4 (4,4), S5 (4,5), S6 (3,5), S7 (3,4), S8 (3,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move to a new cell, the head goes there, and each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten yet, so length same.\n> \n> So if I move from (3,1) to new position.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (3,2)\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (3,2), then S1 (3,1), S2 (4,1), S3 (4,2), S4 (4,3), S5 (4,4), S6 (4,5), S7 (3,5), S8 (3,4). Tail was (3,3), but since no growth, tail moves to previous position of S7, which was (3,4), and S8 is removed? Let's see.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after move U: head to (3,2), then segment 1 (which was at (4,1)) moves to where head was, (3,1)?

It's turn 31, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? No, the walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), and body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). Let me list them in order: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). That's 9 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here. Life span indicates how many turns until they disappear, including the current turn, so for (3,6), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 more turns, including turn 31, so it will be gone by turn 35 if not eaten. Similarly, (4,5) life span 7, gone by turn 38, and (2,1) life span 10, gone by turn 41.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> From the list: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> - Row y=6: ?

Snake has a segment at (4,5), which is the 6th segment in the list? Let's index: positions[0] is head (3,2), [1] is (3,1), [2] is (4,1), [3] is (4,2), [4] is (4,3), [5] is (4,4), [6] is (4,5), [7] is (3,5), [8] is (3,4). So (4,5) is occupied by the snake body at index 6.\n> \n> But there's food at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 7. But since the snake body is on it, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later. Similarly, food at (3,6) and (2,1).\n> \n> Head direction is U, so currently moving up.\n> \n> Now, possible actions: I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but with constraints.\n> \n> Since head direction is U, I cannot move D immediately because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2), moving U.\n> \n> If I move U, I go to (3,3). Is that safe? Let's see what's at (3,3). From snake positions, (3,3) is not occupied; the segments are at (3,2), (3,1), etc., but (3,3) is free? Positions: y=3 has (4,3), but not (3,3). (3,3) is empty. Food? No food at (3,3), I think. Food is at (3,6), (4,5), (2,1), so (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> But (3,3) might be a valid cell. Also, walls: x=3, y=3 is within 1 to 6, so playable, no wall or obstacle. Obstacle is at (5,2), not (3,3).\n> \n> So moving U to (3,3) seems possible.\n> \n> If I move L, left to (2,2). (2,2) is within bounds, x=2,y=2, not wall, not occupied? Snake has (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), etc., no (2,2), and food not there, so should be free.\n> \n> If I move R, right to (4,2). But (4,2) is occupied by the snake body! Position index [3] is (4,2), which is a body segment. But the rule is: I can move into a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but in this case, (4,2) is not the tail; the tail is (3,4).\n> \n> The snake moves: when I move, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free, but in this case, if I move to (4,2), which is currently occupied by a body segment, but since the tail is at (3,4), when I move, the tail will move, so (4,2) might not be free yet.\n> \n> General movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, but since we eat food, if we eat, tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> But for collision: I can move to a cell that is occupied by the tail, because after the move, the tail moves away, so it's safe. But if I move to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it might be a collision.\n> \n> Specifically: the head can move to the cell that is currently the tail, because after movement, that cell is no longer part of the snake. But for other body cells, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (3,4). If I move to (3,4), it should be safe, but (3,4) is not adjacent to head? Head at (3,2), adjacent are (3,3), (2,2), (4,2), (3,1) but (3,1) is down, and since direction U, moving down might not be allowed or not considered.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U: (3,3) - currently empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied cells: from positions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> So (3,3) is not occupied, (2,2) not occupied, (4,2) is occupied (index [3]), (3,1) is occupied (index [1]) but down.\n> \n> Since head direction U, moving D is reverse, not allowed. So only U, L, R possible.\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) - empty, no food, safe.\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) - empty, no food, safe.\n> \n> - R: to (4,2) - but (4,2) is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail (tail is (3,4)), so moving here would cause collision, death. So R is not possible.\n> \n> (4,2) is a body segment, not adjacent to tail in a way that it moves, but since it's fixed, moving head to it would collide. So R is invalid.\n> \n> Now, what about the tail? Tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head, so not an option.\n> \n> So from (3,2), with direction U, possible moves: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2). R to (4,2) is death, D to (3,1) is reverse and also occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> D is reverse and also (3,1) is body, so definitely invalid.\n> \n> So only U or L are safe immediate moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5 turns or more.\n> \n> Also, food considerations.\n> \n> Food at (3,6): value 1, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 34? Life span includes current turn, so at turn 31, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left: turn 31,32,33,34, gone at turn 35. So we have until turn 34 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has life span 7, so until turn 37, and (2,1) until turn 40.\n> \n> But (4,5) is currently occupied by snake body, at index [6], so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,2), direction U.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (3,3).\n> \n> After moving U to (3,3), new head position (3,3), direction U.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body: since moved, the body follows, so positions: new head (3,3), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (3,4) moves? When snake moves without eating, tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after move U to (3,3):\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Then the body: position [1] was (3,2), now moves to where head was? Let's think: the segments shift.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (3,2), 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,4)\n> \n> After move U to (3,3), no food eaten (since (3,3) no food), so head moves to (3,3), then body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was, (3,2), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (3,1), segment 3 moves to (4,1), and so on, up to segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, (3,5), and the tail segment 8 was at (3,4), which is removed.\n> \n> Since no growth, length same, tail removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), then body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // and (3,4) gone.\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,3), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5)  // 9 segments? Original had 9, after move, head new, but tail removed, so 8 segments now? Let's count.\n> \n> Original: 9 positions, meaning snake length 9.\n> \n> After move: head to new cell, tail cell removed, so positions: 8 cells. Head (3,3), and then the first body is the previous head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and the last is (3,5), since (3,4) was tail and removed. So positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]? No.\n> \n> When moving, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: segment 0 (head) moves to (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to position of segment 0, which was (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to position of segment 1, which was (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to position of segment 2, which was (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to position of segment 3, which was (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to position of segment 4, which was (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to position of segment 5, which was (4,4)\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to position of segment 6, which was (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 8 (tail) moves to position of segment 7, which was (3,5)? Segment 7 was (3,5)? Positions: original segment 7 is (3,5), segment 8 is (3,4)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: position of old segment 0: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: position of old segment 1: (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: position of old segment 2: (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: position of old segment 3: (4,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: position of old segment 4: (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: position of old segment 5: (4,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: position of old segment 6: (4,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 8 (new tail): position of old segment 7: (3,5)\n> \n> And old segment 8 at (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]  // 9 positions? No, since tail was removed, it should be 8 positions.\n> \n> Original 9 segments. After move, head moves to new cell, so the snake occupies the new head and all body segments except the tail is removed, so 8 segments.\n> \n> List: head (3,3), then the next segments: the first body is the previous head (3,2), then previous segment 1 (3,1), previous segment 2 (4,1), previous segment 3 (4,2), previous segment 4 (4,3), previous segment 5 (4,4), previous segment 6 (4,5), and the new tail is previous segment 7 (3,5). Previous segment 8 (3,4) is gone.\n> \n> So positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]  // (3,5) is included? Previous segment 7 was (3,5), so new body segment 7 is (3,5), but since tail removed, the last segment is (4,5)? Let's index:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Index 0 (head): (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 1: old pos[0] which was (3,2)\n> \n> - Index 2: old pos[1] which was (3,1)\n> \n> - Index 3: old pos[2] which was (4,1)\n> \n> - Index 4: old pos[3] which was (4,2)\n> \n> - Index 5: old pos[4] which was (4,3)\n> \n> - Index 6: old pos[5] which was (4,4)\n> \n> - Index 7 (tail): old pos[6] which was (4,5)\n> \n> Old pos[7] was (3,5), which is not part of snake anymore, and old pos[8] (3,4) gone.\n> \n> So new snake: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5). 8 segments.\n> \n> Length decreased by 1? No, snake length should be the same if no food eaten. Original length 9, after move without eating, length should be 9, but tail cell vacated, so positions should have 8 cells? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: snake has N segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake occupies N cells, but the segments shift: the new head is the new position, and the body segments are the previous head down to the previous second-to-last, and the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for N segments, after move, it has N segments: new head, and the first N-1 body segments are the previous head to previous segment N-2, and the new tail is the previous segment N-1? Let's use indices.\n> \n> Let positions be P[0] to P[k] for k segments.\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q without eating:\n> \n> - New P[0] = Q\n> \n> - New P[1] = old P[0]\n> \n> - New P[2] = old P[1]\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New P[k] = old P[k-1]\n> \n> But since no growth, the last old position P[k] is vacated, so the new snake has positions from new P[0] to new P[k-1], with length k.\n> \n> In this case, original positions: P[0] to P[8], 9 segments.\n> \n> After move to (3,3):\n> \n> - New P[0] = (3,3)\n> \n> - New P[1] = old P[0] = (3,2)\n> \n> - New P[2] = old P[1] = (3,1)\n> \n> - New P[3] = old P[2] = (4,1)\n> \n> - New P[4] = old P[3] = (4,2)\n> \n> - New P[5] = old P[4] = (4,3)\n> \n> - New P[6] = old P[5] = (4,4)\n> \n> - New P[7] = old P[6] = (4,5)\n> \n> - New P[8] = old P[7] = (3,5)\n> \n> But old P[8] was (3,4), which is not used, so it is vacated. The new snake has 9 segments? New P[8] = old P[7] = (3,5), and old P[8] (3,4) is gone, so the tail is at (3,5), and the cell (3,4) is free.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, new snake: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — that's 9 positions. Yes, because we added a new head and kept all body except the very tail is removed, but in the list, the last body is now the tail.\n> \n> From above, new positions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] — 9 positions, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Old tail (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, no food, so length same.\n> \n> Back to the move.\n> \n> From (3,2), moving U to (3,3) is safe.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,2) is also safe.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is at y=6, which is just below the wall y=7, so it's playable. x=3,y=6.\n> \n> If we go up, we can reach it.\n> \n> But there's also food at (4,5), which is currently occupied, so we need to move away first.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,1), which is near the bottom.\n> \n> Life span: (3,6) has short life, only 4 turns left, so we might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> (4,5) has longer life, 7 turns.\n> \n> (2,1) has 10 turns.\n> \n> But (4,5) is on a body cell, so we need to free it first.\n> \n> At turn 31, head at (3,2), moving U.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,3), then at turn 32, head at (3,3), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can move U, L, or R, D not allowed because direction U.\n> \n> U to (3,4): but (3,4) was just vacated, so empty, no food, safe.\n> \n> L to (2,3): empty, safe.\n> \n> R to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied? Current positions after move: at turn 32 after moving to (3,3), positions as above: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> So (4,3) is occupied by body segment at index 5?

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,3), and the body segments are (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (3,5)\n> \n> The positions are given as a list: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]. So the snake has 9 segments. Head at (3,3), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so each gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including this turn, so if not eaten by turn 34, it's gone? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t+L-1? I need to clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the turn it spawns, countdown is N. After that turn, countdown N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten as long as countdown >0.\n> \n> For (3,6) at turn 32, life span 3, so countdown: turn 32: 3, turn 33:2, turn 34:1, turn 35:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 32, 33, or 34.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 6, so available until turn 37.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 9, available until turn 40.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,5) is listed, but look at snake positions: (4,5) is occupied by the snake! Specifically, it's segment 7: (4,5).\n> \n> But the food is at (4,5) with life span 6, value 1.\n> \n> However, the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So here, food is at (4,5), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. So to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (4,5), and then head moves to (4,5) later.\n> \n> But (4,5) is part of the body, so if the snake moves, the tail will move, so (4,5) might be vacated when the tail moves.\n> \n> Let's see the snake movement. Head at (3,3) moving up. So if it continues up, it might go to (3,4) or something.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5). Head is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (3,5). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,3) and (3,5) are two steps apart, not adjacent. (3,3) adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,2), (4,3), (2,3), etc. But (3,5) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's two away in y-direction.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has life spans, I should consider up to when food disappears or something.\n> \n> Current turn t1=32.\n> \n> I need to output actions for turn 32, 33, 34, 35, ... at least 5 turns, so up to turn 37 or so.\n> \n> But let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, draw the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since borders are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (3,3) head\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (3,5) tail\n> \n> Now, head direction U, so last move was up to (3,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3): up to (3,4), down to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so collision, left to (2,3), right to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied by segment 5.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied, so moving right to (4,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (3,2) is body.\n> \n> Up to (3,4) might be free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Occupied cells: all snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> So from head (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) — not in list, so possible? But is it within bounds? y=4, x=3, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so (3,4) should be free, unless wall or something. Walls only at borders and (5,2), so (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) — occupied, collision.\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) — not in snake positions, should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) — occupied by segment, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. But moving down to (3,2) is invalid anyway because occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,3): Up to (3,4) or Left to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns to maximize score, eating positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (3,6): at y=6, which is the top border? y=6 is not wall, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Similarly, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 all playable except obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3,y=6. Life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 34.\n> \n> - (4,5): but this is currently occupied by snake body. Food is there, but snake is on it, so cannot eat now. When snake moves, if tail moves away, it might be eatable later.\n> \n> - (2,1): at x=2,y=1, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) is food, but occupied now.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (3,6). It's at (3,6), and head is at (3,3), so if I move up multiple times, I could reach it.\n> \n> But (3,6) is at y=6, and walls at y=7, so it's safe to go there.\n> \n> From (3,3), if I move up to (3,4), then from there to (3,5) but (3,5) is tail, which is occupied. (3,5) is part of snake, so moving to (3,5) would be collision unless the tail moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move to (3,4), then next turn, depending on move.\n> \n> Also, (3,5) is the tail, but it's occupied now.\n> \n> Let me simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, for turn 32, I can choose U or L.\n> \n> If I choose U: go to (3,4)\n> \n> Then snake positions: new head at (3,4), body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail (3,5) moves? When head moves to new cell, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten. Since no food at (3,4), I assume, so tail moves.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,5). When head moves to (3,4), the snake: head to (3,4), then segments: previous head (3,3) becomes body, so positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and since no food, tail (3,5) is removed, so new tail is (4,5)? Let's see the list.\n> \n> Original positions: indices: 0:head (3,3), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,3), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,5), 8:tail (3,5)\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): new head (3,4). Then body: the previous segments from 0 to 7, but segment 0 is now body at (3,3), segment 1 at (3,2), ..., up to segment 7 at (4,5), and the tail segment 8 at (3,5) is removed since no growth. So new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So tail is now (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) has food, but it's now the tail position, but the food is under it? The food is at (4,5), and now snake is on it, but since it's body, cannot eat. When the snake moves away, it might be eatable.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,4), direction was U, but after move, the new direction depends on the move. Head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> So after moving U, head direction is now U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4): up to (3,5), but (3,5) is now free? In new positions, cells occupied: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (3,5) is not occupied, and y=5, x=3 is within bounds, no wall, so can move up to (3,5).\n> \n> Left to (2,4), should be free.\n> \n> Right to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied, collision.\n> \n> Down to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction, which is U, so D is opposite, but down is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So from (3,4), can move U to (3,5) or L to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), then new head (3,5), and since no food at (3,5)? (3,5) had tail before, but now it's free. Is there food? Food at (3,6), (4,5), (2,1). (3,5) no food mentioned, so no food. So tail moves: positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) removed? List: after move to (3,5), head (3,5), previous segments: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and since no food, last segment (4,5) removed, so new tail is (4,4).\n> \n> Positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, from here, I can move to (3,6) which has food. (3,6) is up from (3,5).\n> \n> Move U to (3,6): head to (3,6), which has food, value 1, so snake grows: new head (3,6), body includes all previous segments, and tail stays, so positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). And since food eaten, no tail removal, snake length increases to 10 segments. Tail is still (4,4).\n> \n> Now, this can be done by turn 34? Let's see the turns.\n> \n> Turn 32: move U to (3,4)\n> \n> Turn 33: move U to (3,5)\n> \n> Turn 34: move U to (3,6) and eat food.\n> \n> Life span of (3,6) is 3 at turn 32, so on turn 34, countdown should be 1 (since turn 32:3, 33:2, 34:1), so can eat on turn 34.\n> \n> Good.\n> \n> But after eating, head at (3,6), which is y=6, and wall at y=7, so moving up is impossible, y=7 is wall.\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves: down to (3,5), left to (2,6), right to (4,6).\n> \n> But (3,5) is now body, since after eating, positions include (3,5) as segment after head.\n> \n> After eating at (3,6), positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), etc. so (3,5) is occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) might be free, etc.\n> \n> But I need to think about other food, like (4,5) which has food under it.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, and it's currently occupied by the body. In the initial state, (4,5) is segment 7 with food under it.\n> \n> After some moves, when the tail moves away, (4,5) could be vacated.\n> \n> In the sequence above, on turn 32, if I move U to (3,4), tail was at (3,5), which is removed, so (3,5) is free now, but (4,5) is still occupied as part of body.\n> \n> After turn 32 move U to (3,4): positions head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (4,5) is tail now.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, but it's the tail cell. If I can move the head to (4,5), but it's occupied, so I need to vacate it first.\n> \n> If I move such that the tail moves, then (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 33, I move from (3,4) to, say, (2,4) left, then head to (2,4), tail moves, so (4,5) is vacated, and food at (4,5) is now exposed.\n> \n> Then later I can move to (4,5) to eat.\n> \n> But let's see.\n> \n> First, back to turn 32 options.\n> \n> I could move left to (2,3) instead of up.\n> \n> But (3,6) food has short life, only until turn 34, so I should prioritize eating it soon.\n> \n> (4,5) food has life span 6, so until turn 37, more time.\n> \n> (2,1) has even more time.\n> \n> So eating (3,6) might be urgent.\n> \n> Moreover, if I don't go up, I might not reach it in time.\n> \n> For example, if I move left to (2,3) on turn 32.\n> \n> Then from (2,3), I can go to (2,4) or (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body now.\n> \n> After turn 32 move L to (2,3): new head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5) removed, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).

For example, (2,3) to (3,6) is not direct; need to go to (3,4) or something, but (3,4) might be free now? In current positions after move, (3,4) is free? Positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).

Then, I positioned the snake to safely eat the exposed food at (4,5) by moving right to (4,6) on turn 35 and down to (4,5) on turn 36, avoiding any immediate collision risks and leveraging the vacated cell after the tail moved away.

Currently under the tail.\n  - (2,1): value +1, life span 8 (must be eaten by Turn 40).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Down (D) next turn since current direction is U.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom (3,4), the snake can move:\n1. **Up (U)**: to (3,5).\n   - (3,5) is free (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n   - Next turn (Turn 34), can move U to (3,6) to eat the food there before it disappears.\n2. **Left (L)**: to (2,4).\n   - (2,4) is free.\n   - Cannot reach (3,6) in time to eat it by Turn 34.\n3. **Right (R)**: to (4,4).\n   - (4,4) is a body segment (not tail), so this is a collision. Invalid move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The food at (3,6) is urgent (life span 2). To eat it:\n  - Must be at (3,5) on Turn 33, then move to (3,6) on Turn 34.\n- The food at (4,5) is under the tail. To eat it:\n  - Must move the tail away first (e.g., by moving U or L on Turn 33), then move the head to (4,5) later.\n  - However, the head is not adjacent to the tail (diagonal), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\" if eaten later.\n- The food at (2,1) is less urgent (life span 8).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move U to (3,5)** on Turn 33. This allows:\n  - Eating (3,6) on Turn 34 (urgent).\n  - Freeing (4,5) for potential later eating (tail moves away).\n  - Avoiding collision or dead ends.\n\n### Why Not L to (2,4)?\n- Cannot reach (3,6) in time to eat it by Turn 34.\n- (4,5) is still under the tail after moving L, and reaching it later would be difficult due to body segments blocking the path.\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 33 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 6, 2, 1)\n\t- (4, 5, 5, 1)\n\t- (2, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 33 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the tail is at (4,5). The head direction is Up, which is U, meaning (x,y+1).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. Since it's turn 33, if not eaten, it will disappear after turn 34? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 33, life span is 2, meaning after this turn it becomes 1, and after turn 34 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it must be eaten by turn 34 to get it.\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 5. But (4,5) is the tail position! The snake positions include (4,5) as the tail. Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 8. All food has value 1, positive food, since no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> All food here is positive, value +1.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,4), direction U. So moving up would go to (3,5). But let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Possible directions: U, D, L, R. But cannot do instant reverse. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on the next turn. Reverse of U is D, so D is not allowed.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, L, R. (since D is reverse).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cannot move to those cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Head is at (3,4).\n> \n> So the body cells: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (4,5) is tail.\n> \n> Now, for movement, if head moves to a cell, it should not be a wall, obstacle, or body segment, except the tail, because when head moves, the tail moves, so it's safe to move to the tail's current position, but only if it's the tail and it will move away.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the tail cell, it's okay because after moving, the tail moves forward, so no collision. But if it moves to any other body segment, it collides.\n> \n> Also, the tail has food under it: (4,5) has food with value 1, life span 5. But to eat it, the snake must move so that the tail moves away, then head moves onto it later. But directly, if head moves to (4,5) now, since it's the tail, it should be safe to move there, and eating the food? Let's see.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is under the tail. If head moves to (4,5), since (4,5) is the current tail, when head moves there, it will eat the food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning that the new tail will be where the tail was, but since head is now on (4,5), and it eats food, the tail stays, so effectively, the segment that was tail becomes part of body, and a new segment is added, so head and the new tail might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> There's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (3,4), tail is at (4,5). Are they adjacent? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> (3,4) and (4,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal? Adjacency means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (3,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not sharing an edge.\n> \n> Adjacent cells would be: (3,4) and (3,5) up, (3,3) down, (2,4) left, (4,4) right.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head (3,4); it's one step right and one step up, so not directly adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,5) might be possible, but let's see.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position (3,4):\n> \n> - U: to (3,5).

Also, walls: y=7 is border, but (3,5) y=5, x=3, within 0-7, not border or obstacle. So (3,5) is free.\n> \n> - D: but D is reverse of current direction U, so not allowed.

(4,4) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,5). (4,4) is the second last or something. Positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (4,4) is the 8th position, body segment. So if head moves to (4,4), it collides with body, death.\n> \n> Therefore, R to (4,4) is not safe; collision.\n> \n> So possible safe moves: U to (3,5) or L to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (3,6): at (3,6), which is one above (3,5).

Turn 33: life span 5, after turn 33: 4, turn 34:3, turn 35:2, turn 36:1, turn 37:0 gone.

After moving to (2,4) on turn 33, the snake moves: head to (2,4), then body follows: (3,4) becomes new segment 1, (3,3) segment 2, etc., tail at (4,5) moves to (4,4)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 33 start: positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> After move, say to (3,5): new positions: head (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, so [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] and tail (4,5) is gone? When head moves to new cell, the tail moves only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays and new segment added.\n> \n> But in this move to (3,5), no food eaten, since (3,5) has no food? Food is at (3,6), (4,5), (2,1). (3,5) is empty, I think.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5): no food, so tail moves: head to (3,5), then body: (3,4) becomes position 1, (3,3) position 2, ..., up to (4,4) position 8, and (4,5) was tail, but since no growth, tail moves off, so new tail is where (4,4) was? Positions after move: head at (3,5), then segments: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Length still 9, but tail now at (4,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (2,4): head to (2,4), then body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5) moves off, so tail at (4,4)? After move, positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] and (4,5) gone.\n> \n> Now back to food at (3,6): if on turn 33 I move U to (3,5), then on turn 34 I can move U to (3,6). Since (3,6) has food, I eat it, snake grows, so new positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), ..., up to (4,3), and tail stays at (4,4)? When eating food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Turn 34: after moving to (3,6), food eaten, so new head at (3,6), previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail remains, so positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] length 10.\n> \n> If I don't go to (3,5) on turn 33, I might not reach (3,6) in time. For example, if I go L to (2,4) on turn 33, then on turn 34 I can move to (2,5) or (3,4), etc. To reach (3,6), I need to go to (3,5) first, but (3,5) might be occupied or something. After turn 33 move L to (2,4), positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), ... (4,4)] as above. On turn 34, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), or R to (3,4), but (3,4) is now a body segment, so moving to (3,4) would collide, death. Cannot. Or D to (2,3), or L to (1,4). To go to (3,5), I need to go through (2,5) or (3,4), but (3,4) occupied. From (2,4), move U to (2,5) on turn 34, then on turn 35 move R to (3,5), but by then (3,6) food might be gone? Turn 34: life span of (3,6) was 2 at turn 33, after turn 33 it becomes 1, after turn 34 it becomes 0 and disappears. So on turn 34, if I eat it on turn 34, it's ok, but if I'm on (2,5) on turn 34, I can't eat (3,6) directly; I need to move to (3,6) on turn 34, but from (2,4) on turn 33, on turn 34 I can only move to adjacent cells: (2,5), (1,4), (2,3), or (3,4) but (3,4) occupied. So I can only go to (2,5), (1,4), or (2,3). None of which is (3,6). To get to (3,6), I need at least two moves from (2,4): to (2,5) then to (3,5), then to (3,6) on turn 35, but on turn 35 the food is gone. So only by moving towards it on turn 33 can I eat it on turn 34.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat the (3,6) food, I must move U to (3,5) on turn 33, then U to (3,6) on turn 34.\n> \n> Otherwise, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,5) is under the tail, but after moving, the tail moves. On turn 33, if I move U to (3,5), no food eaten, tail moves to (4,4), so (4,5) is now free, but has food with life span 5.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L, tail moves, (4,5) free.\n> \n> But (4,5) has food, so I can eat it later.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,1), which is near the bottom.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> If I go for (3,6) food, I get +1, length increases.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to plan next moves.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,5) is now free after turn 33, since tail moves.\n> \n> After turn 33 move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4) to (4,4), tail at (4,4)? Earlier: positions after move to (3,5): [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] so (4,5) is free and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved L, (4,5) free.\n> \n> But in this case, by moving U, I can get the (3,6) food.\n> \n> Now, what about the (4,5) food? It's at (4,5), which is adjacent to head after move? After turn 33, head at (3,5), (4,5) is to the right.\n> \n> (3,5) and (4,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,5) on turn 34, but on turn 34 I plan to move to (3,6) to eat that food.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5) on turn 34, I eat that food, but then I miss (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) has short life, must be eaten now, while (4,5) has longer life.\n> \n> Prioritize short life food? But (3,6) is about to disappear, so better to get it if possible.\n> \n> Moreover, getting (3,6) increases length, which might help in survival.\n> \n> Now, also, the tail danger: if head adjacent to tail and eat food at tail, but here tail is not at (4,5) anymore after turn 33.\n> \n> After turn 33, tail is at (4,4), head at (3,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is free with food.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5) on turn 34, I eat the food there. Head at (3,5), moving R to (4,5).\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, snake grows: new head at (4,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail stays, so tail remains at (4,4). Now, head at (4,5), tail at (4,4), which are adjacent vertically? (4,5) and (4,4), same x, y differs by 1, so adjacent.\n> \n> And I just ate food at (4,5), which was positive food.\n> \n> According to Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, when I eat the food, the tail cell is (4,4), which may or may not have food, but the food was at (4,5), not at tail cell.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> Here, tail cell is (4,4), which has no food; food was at (4,5), which is now head.\n> \n> So no issue; eating at (4,5) should be fine, as long as (4,4) doesn't have food, which it doesn't.\n> \n> The rule applies only if the tail cell itself has food, and head eats it while adjacent to tail.\n> \n> But here, the food is not on tail cell after move; tail cell is (4,4), no food.\n> \n> So moving to (4,5) and eating is safe.\n> \n> But in this sequence, on turn 34, if I move to (4,5), I eat (4,5) food, but miss (3,6) which disappears.\n> \n> Whereas if I move to (3,6), I eat that and (4,5) is still there for later.\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 5, so after turn 33, it has life span 4 left (since after turn 33 decrease), so I can eat it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has more life.\n> \n> So better to get the expiring food first.\n> \n> Thus, for turn 33, I should move U to (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 34, move U to (3,6) to eat that food.\n> \n> After that, head at (3,6), and snake longer.\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to plan next moves.\n> \n> Also, after turn 33 move, (4,5) is free with food, so I can go for it later.\n> \n> Let's think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Turn 33: move U to (3,5)\n> \n> Turn 34: move U to (3,6), eat food, snake grows to length 10.

But in terms of movement, U: (x,y+1) increases y, so if y=1 is bottom, U moves up to higher y.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (x,y-1) decreases y, so down.\n> \n> In snake positions: head at (3,5), which is x=3, y=5.\n> \n> Then (3,4) - that's down, y=4 <5.\n> \n> Then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) - all decreasing y, so down.\n> \n> Then (4,1) - from (3,1) to (4,1), that's right, x increases.\n> \n> Then (4,2) - from (4,1) to (4,2), that's up, y increases.\n> \n> Then (4,3), (4,4) - up again.\n> \n> So the snake: from head (3,5) down to (3,1), then right to (4,1), then up to (4,4). So body segments: (3,4) to (3,1) and (4,1) to (4,4). (4,4) is the last? Positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] so 9 segments. Head at (3,5), tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. So current direction is up, meaning last move was to (3,5) from (3,4)? From (3,4) to (3,5) is U, yes.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6,1,1) : position (3,6), value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (4,5,4,1) : (4,5), value 1, life_span 4? Life_span is how many turns it lasts, including current turn.\n> \n> Life_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for (3,6,1,1): at turn 34, life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Countdown decreases on turn 34, so after turn 34, it's gone. Since we're at turn 34, and we make a move, if we move to it this turn, we can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5,4,1): value 1, life_span 4, so it will last until turn 37 or something? Life_span 4 at turn 34, so after 4 turns: turn 34,35,36,37, it disappears after turn 37? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 34, life_span=4, after turn 34, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then after turn 37, when countdown to 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 34 to 37.\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"life_span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? Example: if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t, meaning we must eat it on turn t or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, L=4 at turn t, it will be there for turns t, t+1, t+2, t+3, and disappear after turn t+3, so last chance to eat is turn t+3.\n> \n> In this case, turn t=34.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,6): value=1, life=1, so must eat on turn 34 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (4,5): value=1, life=4, can eat until turn 37.\n> \n> - (2,1): value=1, life=7, can eat until turn 40? Life=7 at turn 34, so disappears after turn 40, last eat turn 40.\n> \n> - (2,3): value=1, life=10, disappears after turn 43, last eat turn 43.\n> \n> All food have value +1, no negative food mentioned. Value is all 1, so all positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction U (up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is U, so cannot go D (down), because reverse is not allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So from U, I cannot go D. Can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, check the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> So cells occupied by snake: let's list:\n> \n> - (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) - vertical down\n> \n> - (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) - vertical up\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied, but head is at (3,5), so (4,4) is body.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (3,6) - above head, y=6\n> \n> - (4,5) - right and up, x=4,y=5\n> \n> - (2,1) - left and down, x=2,y=1\n> \n> - (2,3) - left and up, x=2,y=3\n> \n> (2,1) is at y=1, which is bottom row.\n> \n> Now, current turn 34, I need to choose action for turn 34.\n> \n> First, the food at (3,6) has life=1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. It's directly above head at (3,5), so moving U to (3,6) would eat it.\n> \n> But is it safe?\n> \n> (3,6): is it a valid cell? y=6, which is not y=7, so within bounds. Walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> Now, moving to (3,6): would the snake collide with itself?\n> \n> After moving, the head moves to (3,6), and the body follows. Since we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), head moves to (3,6), which has food, so we eat it, value +1, length increases. New head at (3,6), then the body segments: the first body segment was (3,5), which is now the neck, and so on, down to (4,4), and since we ate, the tail stays, so new tail is still at (4,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> When snake moves and eats, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, and since we eat, a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the tail does not move; it grows by one cell. So the new head is at the food cell, and the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a free cell: head moves to new position, B1 moves to H's old position, B2 to B1's old, ..., T moves to second last, and last position is empty.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to food position, B1 to H old, B2 to B1 old, ..., T stays, so the tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment at T's position? No.\n> \n> When eating, the snake grows: so after moving head to new cell (with food), all body segments move as usual, but since we eat, we don't remove the tail; we keep it, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the new neck, and so on, down to the tail, which remains, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, but the end is the tail.\n> \n> Example: positions [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> Move to new cell without eating: new positions [new H, old H, B1, B2] and T is removed, but in list, [new cell, old H, B1, B2], so T is gone.\n> \n> With eating: [new cell (food), old H, B1, B2, T], so T is still there, and we add the food cell, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, before move: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) so 9 positions.\n> \n> If move U to (3,6) and eat: new head at (3,6), then previous positions: (3,5) becomes body, (3,4) body, ..., down to (4,4) remains tail. So new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] now 10 segments.\n> \n> Is there collision? Head at (3,6), check if it collides with any body part. Body parts are from (3,5) down to (4,4). (3,6) is not in that list, so no collision. Also, not wall, since y=6 <7.\n> \n> But what about the food? (3,6) has food, we eat it.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,4), head is moving to (3,6). Is head adjacent to tail? (4,4) and (3,6): are they adjacent?\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> (4,4) to (3,6): x differs by 1, y by 2, so not adjacent. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = |3-4| + |6-4| =1 + 2 =3, not 1, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Tail cell: (4,4) has no food, food is at (3,6), not on tail.\n> \n> So moving to (3,6) should be safe and we eat the food.\n> \n> But life_span of (3,6) is 1, so if I don't go there this turn, it disappears, and I lose the chance.\n> \n> Now, other options: I could go to other places.\n> \n> But let's think long term.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is close, at (4,5), which is right and same y? Head at (3,5), (4,5) is right, x+1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is left and down, etc.\n> \n> But (3,6) is immediate, and will disappear.\n> \n> Now, if I go to (3,6), I get +1, length increases.\n> \n> Then, from there, I need to think next moves.\n> \n> But I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, avoid risks.\n> \n> Another thing: after moving to (3,6), where can I go?\n> \n> Head at (3,6), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves: from U, cannot go D, so can go U, L, R.\n> \n> But U to (3,7): y=7 is wall, so cannot go up, out of bounds.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (3,7) invalid.\n> \n> L to (2,6), or R to (4,6).\n> \n> (2,6) and (4,6) are both within bounds? x=2,y=6; x=4,y=6 both x=1-6, y=1-6 ok.\n> \n> But are they occupied? Snake: after move to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> So (2,6) is free, (4,6) is free? (4,6) not occupied, yes.\n> \n> (4,6) might be a cell to go to.\n> \n> But no food there directly.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is at (4,5), which is below (4,6)? y=5.\n> \n> From (3,6), if I go R to (4,6), then head at (4,6), direction R? After moving R, new direction is R.\n> \n> Then from (4,6), I can go to (4,5), which has food.\n> \n> (4,5) has food with life=4, so I can eat it later.\n> \n> But if I go to (4,6) first, then to (4,5), I can eat (4,5) on next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L to (2,6) from (3,6), then I might go to (2,5) or something.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 34, if I don't go to (3,6), it disappears, and I miss a point.\n> \n> If I go elsewhere, I might eat other food later.\n> \n> But all food is +1, so eating (3,6) gives immediate reward with low risk.\n> \n> Is there risk? Moving to (3,6) seems safe.\n> \n> But after that, I might be cornered.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), if I go U to (3,6), eat, then head at (3,6).\n> \n> Then, as above, U is wall, so only L or R.\n> \n> L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, (4,6) is free, and from there I can go D to (4,5), which has food.\n> \n> (4,5) is currently occupied? No, food is at (4,5), but is it under snake body?\n> \n> Food positions: (4,5) is listed, but snake is at (3,5), (3,4), etc., (4,4), (4,3), not at (4,5), so (4,5) is free cell with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has food, but far.\n> \n> After going to (3,6), if I go R to (4,6), then on turn 35, I move to (4,6), no food there? (4,6) has no food, so just move, no eat.\n> \n> Then new head at (4,6), direction R.\n> \n> Then on turn 36, I can go D to (4,5), since from R, I can go D? Directions: from current direction R, I can go U, D, R, L? But no instant reverse, but from R, reverse is L? Current direction is R, moving right, so opposite is L (left), so cannot go L, but can go U, D, R.\n> \n> To (4,5), which is down, so D.\n> \n> (4,5) is directly below (4,6), so moving D to (4,5) eats the food, since food is there.\n> \n> Life_span of (4,5) is 4 at turn 34, so at turn 36, it should still be there? Turn 34: life=4, after turn 34, life=3; after turn 35, life=2; after turn 36, life=1? Let's see countdown.\n> \n> At turn 34, life_span=4, so after turn 34 (i.e., before turn 35), countdown decreases to 3.\n> \n> Similarly, after turn 35, to 2; after turn 36, to 1; after turn 37, to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So at turn 36, when I move to (4,5), life_span would be? Before turn 36, after turn 35, life_span=2? I need to think per turn.\n> \n> Define: at the start of turn t, the life_span is L, then after the snake moves and if eaten, it's consumed, else at end of turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will be present during turn t, and if not eaten, at end of turn, countdown decreases to L-1.\n> \n> Then at turn t+1, life_span L-1, and so on.\n> \n> For (4,5) at turn 34: life_span=4, so it can be eaten on turn 34,35,36,37. On turn 37, if eaten, life_span=1? At start of turn 37, life_span=1, if not eaten during turn, at end decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,6) at turn 34: life_span=1, so if not eaten on turn 34, at end of turn, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Back to sequence.\n> \n> If on turn 34, I move U to (3,6), eat food, length 10 now.\n> \n> Then turn 35: from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6). Say I go R to (4,6), no food, just move. Head to (4,6), body follows, tail moves? When not eating, tail moves.\n> \n> After eating on turn 34, positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), ..., (4,4)] 10 segments.\n> \n> Turn 35: move to (4,6), no food there, so head to (4,6), then (3,6) becomes body, (3,5) body, ..., down to (4,4) moves to (4,3)?

When not eating, snake moves, head to new position, each segment to next, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move to (4,6) without eating: new positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Tail was (4,4), but since not eaten, (4,4) is now empty, and (4,3) is new tail?

This guarantees eating it before it disappears on Turn 38.\n   - (2,1) and (2,3) are on the left. Moving left allows reaching them, but (4,5) will be missed.\n3. **Score Maximization**:\n   - Going right: Eat (4,5) (+1), but likely miss (2,1) (total +1).\n   - Going left: Eat (2,3) and (2,1) (+2), but miss (4,5) (total +2).\n4. **Risks**:\n   - Going right: No immediate risks, but may limit future options due to snake length.\n   - Going left: Must ensure no tail reward danger when eating (2,1). Currently, the tail is at (4,4), and (2,1) is not adjacent to the tail, so safe.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Left (L)**: Leads to higher score (+2) by eating (2,3) and (2,1), while missing (4,5).

It's turn 35. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake is mostly vertical in column 3 from y=1 to y=6, then turns right to column 4 from y=1 to y=4. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,6)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,1)  // this is the tail end of the vertical part\n> \n> - (4,1)  // here it turns right\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,4)  // tail\n> \n> The snake has 10 segments. Head at (3,6), moving Up, which is decreasing y since y=6 is near the top? Coordinates: y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but let's confirm.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, that means y increases upwards. But in the position, (3,6) to (3,5) to (3,4), etc., and head direction is U, so from (3,6) moving U would go to (3,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that might be blocked.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to (3,6).

Turn 35: life_span decreases to 2, turn 36 to 1, turn 37 to 0, so gone after turn 37. Similarly, (2,1) life_span=6, disappears after turn 40 (35+6-1=40? Let's see: at turn 35, life_span=6, so after 6 turns, on turn 41 it should be gone? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears. So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn 35, life_span=3, so:\n> \n> - Turn 35: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 36: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 37: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 38: life_span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,5): life_span=3 at turn 35, so available until turn 37, gone on turn 38.\n> \n> (2,1): life_span=6, available until turn 40 (turn 35:6, 36:5, 37:4, 38:3, 39:2, 40:1, 41:0 gone)\n> \n> (2,3): life_span=9, available until turn 43.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 35 onwards.\n> \n> First, what are possible moves from current position? Head at (3,6), direction U (up, so y+1).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D (down).

So (3,6): x=3, y=6.\n> \n> Moving U: (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Moving D: (3,5) but (3,5) is a body segment? Snake positions: (3,6) head, (3,5) is next, so (3,5) is occupied by body. But can I move to a body segment? Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment, but exception for tail if it moves away.\n> \n> Let's see the positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), etc. down to (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n> \n> So from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) would hit the body immediately, since (3,5) is the second segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: L is (x-1,y), so (2,6). Is that wall? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 is not border, and no internal wall there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant. So (2,6) should be free? But is it occupied by body? Snake positions: all in x=3 or x=4, y from 1 to 6. (2,6) not in list, so should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right: R (x+1,y) to (4,6). (4,6) not in snake positions? Positions have (4,4), (4,3), etc., but (4,6) not listed, so empty.\n> \n> (4,5) is food, but not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So y=6 only (3,6), y=5 (3,5), down to y=1 (3,1) and (4,1), etc. (4,6) is not occupied, so free.\n> \n> But (4,5) has food, but snake is not there.\n> \n> Now possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) — y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — occupied by body (second segment), and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (4,4). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) — should be free, no wall, not body\n> \n> - R: (4,6) — should be free, no wall, not body\n> \n> Also, cannot move D because it's opposite to current U? Current direction is U, so moving D is opposite, and rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So, from U, cannot move D immediately.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are L or R. U is invalid, D is invalid and also opposite, so only L or R.\n> \n> So for turn 35, I must choose between Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (4,5): value +1, life_span 3, so must be eaten by turn 37 (since on turn 38 it disappears). At turn 35, it's there, life_span 3.\n> \n> - (2,1): value +1, life_span 6, eat by turn 40\n> \n> - (2,3): value +1, life_span 9, eat by turn 43\n> \n> Also, snake head is at (3,6), and food at (4,5) is close.\n> \n> (4,5) is adjacent to current head? (3,6) to (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or same y, difference 1.\n> \n> (3,6) to (4,5): delta x=1, delta y=-1, so diagonal, not adjacent.

Tail is at (4,4). Now, is there food on the tail? The food positions are (4,5), (2,1), (2,3), none at (4,4), so no food on tail currently. But if I eat food, the tail grows, but when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after eating, the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added, so the tail position doesn't change immediately? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move on the turn you eat, so the new segment is added at the head position after moving, I think.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves one cell, unless you eat food, then the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> Yes, from the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, meaning when eaten, tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> So after eating, the snake is longer.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (4,4).

Length 10.\n> \n> Then turn 36: move down to (4,5). Now (4,5) has food, so eat it. Since positive food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move. New head at (4,5), and the segment that was at (4,5) is now part of body, but (4,5) was empty before, now head moves there.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (4,5), head (4,5), then previous head (4,6) body, then (3,6) body, then (3,5), ..., down to (4,4) tail, and since ate food, tail doesn't move, so snake now has 11 segments: (4,5) head, (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,4) but since tail didn't move, (4,4) is still tail, but now the segment before was (4,3) or something?

No: from turn 35 after move: head (4,6), then body segments: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,4). (4,4) is the last.\n> \n> When moving down to (4,5) on turn 36, head moves to (4,5), which has food, so eat: snake grows, so the tail (4,4) does not move. New positions: head (4,5), then the previous head (4,6) becomes new body segment, and all previous body segments remain, so body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,4) still there since no move.

After moving to (2,6), snake positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), ..., same as before but head at (2,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is now a body segment, so moving back to (3,6) would collide.\n> \n> But R to (3,6) is occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (2,5) should be free.\n> \n> L to (1,6) free.\n> \n> U invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,6), can go L, D, or possibly other, but not U or R.\n> \n> But (2,5) might be free.\n> \n> Now, to reach food at (4,5) from (2,6), it might take more turns: e.g., turn 35: L to (2,6), then turn 36: D to (2,5), then turn 37: R to (3,5)? (3,5) is body, not free. Or turn 37: D to (2,4), then to (3,4), etc., but (3,4) is body.\n> \n> To reach (4,5), from (2,6), I need to go down and then right, but the column x=3 is occupied by snake body from y=1 to 6, so (3,5), (3,4), etc. are occupied, so I cannot go to (3,5) directly.\n> \n> For example, after moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), ..., down to (4,4).\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to (3,5) from (2,6) or from (2,5).\n> \n> From (2,6), if I go down to (2,5), which should be free, then from (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), and so on, down to (2,1) where there is food.\n> \n> (2,1) has food, life_span 6, so I have time.\n> \n> But (4,5) has short life, only until turn 37, meaning I need to eat it by turn 37.\n> \n> Turn 35: if I go left to (2,6), I can't reach (4,5) by turn 37 easily.\n> \n> From (2,6) on turn 35, then turn 36: say D to (2,5), turn 37: D to (2,4), but (4,5) is at x=4, I'm at x=2, y=4, not close. To go to (4,5), I need to go right, but x=3 is blocked by snake body.\n> \n> The snake body occupies x=3 from y=1 to 6, so until the snake moves, those cells are blocked.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4), when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 35 I go left to (2,6), then snake moves: head to (2,6), tail moves from (4,4) to where? The body segments: the tail was (4,4), previous was (4,3), so when head moves to (2,6), the tail (4,4) is removed, and a new segment is added at head, so the segment at (4,4) is gone, and (4,3) becomes new tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So after turn 35, if I move left to (2,6): new head (2,6), then the body: the first body segment moves to previous head (3,6), so (3,6) now body, then (3,5) to (3,5)? Positions: previous: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n> \n> After move to (2,6): head (2,6), then body segments: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail is now (4,3)? Let's sequence: the segment that was at (3,6) is now at the position of the new first body, which is (3,6), but since head moved to (2,6), the body segment that was at (3,5) moves to (3,6)? No.\n> \n> The snake is a list: positions [p0, p1, p2, ..., p9] with p0 head, p9 tail.\n> \n> At turn start: positions: p0=(3,6), p1=(3,5), p2=(3,4), p3=(3,3), p4=(3,2), p5=(3,1), p6=(4,1), p7=(4,2), p8=(4,3), p9=(4,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then new positions: [new_head, p0, p1, p2, ..., p8] if no eat, so tail p9 is removed.\n> \n> So if move to (2,6): new positions: head (2,6), then p0 becomes body: (3,6), then p1: (3,5), p2: (3,4), p3: (3,3), p4: (3,2), p5: (3,1), p6: (4,1), p7: (4,2), p8: (4,3), and p9 (4,4) is removed, so tail is now (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move right to (4,6): new head (4,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), tail (4,4) removed? p9 is (4,4), removed, new tail is p8=(4,3).\n> \n> In the right move case, after turn 35 to (4,6): positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> Then turn 36, move to (4,5): since (4,5) has food, eat, so snake grows: new head (4,5), then body: (4,6) (previous head), (3,6), (3,5), ..., down to (4,3), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (4,3) remains, and new tail is still (4,3)? No.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to new cell, and the tail does not move, so the new segment is added, meaning the position list gains a new segment at the end.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (4,5) with eat: new head (4,5), then the previous positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,3) but since no move, it stays, so now 11 segments, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is the last.\n> \n> Back to the point: if I go left on turn 35, I can reach (2,1) or (2,3) food, but (4,5) will disappear soon.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,5) must be eaten by turn 37. Turn 37 is the last chance, life_span decreases to 1 on turn 37, gone on turn 38.\n> \n> If I go left to (2,6) on turn 35, then on turn 36 I can go down to (2,5), then on turn 37 I can go down to (2,4), but (4,5) is at (4,5), I'm at (2,4), not reachable in one move, and x=3 is blocked, so I cannot reach (4,5) by turn 37. Even if I go to (2,5) on turn 36, then to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied, so I can't. The only way to (4,5) is from (4,6) or (3,5) or (5,5) but (5,5) not adjacent directly, or (4,4) but occupied.\n> \n> Adjacent to (4,5): (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5)\n> \n> (4,6) might be free after turn 35 if I move there, but if I go left, (4,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> But from (2,4) on turn 37, I can't reach (4,5) directly; it's not adjacent.\n> \n> So if I go left on turn 35, I cannot eat (4,5) before it disappears.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (4,5), I must go right on turn 35 to (4,6), then down to (4,5) on turn 36.\n> \n> That seems the only way to get that food.\n> \n> Moreover, (4,5) is positive, +1 score, and I can get it safely.\n> \n> If I go left, I miss this food, and it disappears, so I lose the opportunity.\n> \n> Other food has longer life, so I can get them later.\n> \n> But I need to think about long-term survival and other risks.\n> \n> After eating (4,5), I have a longer snake, which might be more risky, but currently the grid has space.\n> \n> Also, the tail reward danger: after eating, head at (4,5), tail at (4,3)? In the scenario after eating on turn 36: positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), tail (4,3)\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), tail at (4,3).

But (2,6) is body segment, (3,5) is body, so only possible moves are down to (2,4) or left to (1,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is directly above, but moving up is not allowed because of no reverse; current direction is D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Similarly, right to (3,5) is body, collision.\n> \n> So only down or left.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,5) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.

So on turn 37, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0, and it disappears after this turn? Let's see the counting.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life_span is given, it decreases each turn, so after life_span turns, it disappears.\n> \n> For (4,5): life span 1 at turn 37. So on turn 37, if head not on it, after turn 37, it disappears. So I can only eat it on turn 37 if I move to (4,5) now, but I can't because it's not adjacent; I'm at (2,5), (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5). (4,5) is two cells away.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (4,5) this turn; it will disappear after this turn. So I should ignore it; it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,1) life span 4, (2,3) life span 7, (5,4) life span 10.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,5), only moves: D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail.\n> \n> But tail is at (4,2), head at (2,5), not adjacent.

It's turn 38. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,4), then body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means it was moving down to (2,4) from (2,5)? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - Next: (2,5) — that's above, so if head is at (2,4) and moving down, it should be going to lower y, but (2,5) has higher y? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The problem doesn't specify, but since moving up is (x,y+1) and down is (x,y-1), that suggests that y increases as we go up, like in math coordinates. Let me check:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) — up, y increases\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) — down, y decreases\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) — left, x decreases\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) — right, x increases\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? No: walls at y=0 and y=7, and since D is y-1, moving down decreases y, so y=0 must be the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head is at (2,4), and next segment is (2,5). Since head is at (2,4) and moving down (D), which is decreasing y, so from previous position. Snake positions are given as a list: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), ...] with head first. So the head is at index 0: (2,4), then body: (2,5), (2,6), etc.\n> \n> If head is at (2,4) and moving down, that means it came from a higher y, but (2,5) is at higher y, which is above (2,4). Let's think: if the snake was moving down to (2,4), it must have come from (2,5), because moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) decreases y. Then (2,5) is the segment behind the head.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (2,4)\n> \n> Index 1: (2,5) — which is directly above, so this is the neck or first body segment.\n> \n> Then index 2: (2,6) — even higher y, so up.\n> \n> Then index 3: (3,6) — right and same y? (3,6) x=3,y=6\n> \n> Then index 4: (3,5) — down to y=5\n> \n> Index 5: (3,4) — down to y=4\n> \n> Index 6: (3,3) — down to y=3\n> \n> Index 7: (3,2) — down to y=2\n> \n> Index 8: (3,1) — down to y=1\n> \n> Index 9: (4,1) — right to x=4, y=1\n> \n> So the snake is moving. Head at (2,4) with direction down, so it was moving down to (2,4) from (2,5), I assume. Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which is the current direction it's facing, meaning the direction it moved to get to the current head position.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,1,4,1) — I think this is (x,y, life_span, value). Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ) but in the input it's written as (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the state:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 4, 1) - (2, 3, 6, 1) - (5, 4, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> It says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but in the list it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? That might be a mistake. Look: \" (2, 1, 4, 1) \" — probably it's (x,y, life_span, value) but the header says \"Value and Life Span\", so it might be inconsistent.\n> \n> In the core rules, it's \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be (position), value, life_span.\n> \n> But in the state, it's written as (2,1,4,1) which might be shorthand for x=2,y=1, life_span=4, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3,6,1) : x=2,y=3, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (5,4,9,1) : x=5,y=4, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> And all values are +1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 38, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 38+4-1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0. If at turn t, life_span=L, then after L-1 turns, at turn t + L - 1, it will have countdown 1, and on turn t + L, it disappears? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, countdown decreases to L-1, and so on.

The phrasing is ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think \"disappears after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns total, and the countdown decreases each turn, starting from the current turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if spawned, life_span=N, at turn t, countdown=N, then at turn t+1, countdown=N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, countdown=1, and after turn t+N-1, it disappears, so it's not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, it is gone.\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the beginning of turn t, life_span is L, then during turn t, it is present with countdown L, and after turn t, countdown becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and so on.

Since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 38, countdown=4, turn 39:3, turn 40:2, turn 41:1, turn 42:0, so it disappears before turn 42, so last chance to eat is turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): life_span=6 at turn 38, so available until turn 38+6-1=43? Turn 38: countdown=6, 39:5, 40:4, 41:3, 42:2, 43:1, disappear before 44.\n> \n> (5,4): life_span=9, available until turn 38+9-1=46.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all good to eat.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down, so moving towards decreasing y)\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse.

Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So (2,3) is not occupied by snake, it's free for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): not in snake positions, (5,4) not occupied.\n> \n> (2,1) is at (2,1), which is below the tail or something.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,1), and (3,1) is also occupied.\n> \n> (2,1) is empty.\n> \n> Now, let's list free cells or something.\n> \n> First, for current turn, turn 38, head at (2,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: down to (2,3) — y decreases to 3\n> \n> - L: left to (1,4)\n> \n> - R: right to (3,4)\n> \n> Cannot U because reverse.\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> (2,3): is it a wall? Walls are borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, and internal (5,2). (2,3) is not a border, not (5,2), so not wall.\n> \n> Is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,3) is occupied, but (2,3) is not in the list, so free? Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So (2,3) is not occupied, so moving to (2,3) is possible, but there is food at (2,3), value +1, life_span 6.\n> \n> (2,3) has food, so if I move to (2,3), I eat it, snake grows to 11 segments.\n> \n> But I need to be careful with collisions after moving.\n> \n> After moving to (2,3), new head position (2,3), tail is at (4,1), which will move to (3,1) or something? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move, and the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat food, snake grows, so tail stays, head moves to new position.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current:\n> \n> - Move D to (2,3): eat food there? (2,3) has food, so yes, eat it, snake grows, new head at (2,3), new body: previous head (2,4) becomes new segment, so positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5), etc., and tail (4,1) stays, so snake has 11 segments now.\n> \n> But after moving, the body segments: when head moves to (2,3), the segment that was at (2,4) becomes the neck, and so on.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (2,4), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,1), 9: (4,1)\n> \n> After move D to (2,3) and eat food: new head at (2,3), then the body: since food eaten, new segment added, so the tail doesn't move. So new positions: head (2,3), then previous head (2,4) now index 1, then (2,5) index 2, (2,6) index 3, (3,6) index 4, (3,5) index 5, (3,4) index 6, (3,3) index 7, (3,2) index 8, (3,1) index 9, and tail (4,1) index 10, but since we add a segment, tail is (4,1) and new tail is still (4,1)? No.\n> \n> When food eaten, the snake grows: head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail remains in place, and the segment before tail now points to it.\n> \n> Positions: after moving head to (2,3), the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 (2,5) moves to index 0's old position? Standard: the segment that was at position k moves to position k-1 for k>0, but since head is new, the new body starts from the old head position.\n> \n> After move: new head at new position (2,3), then the first body segment is at old head position (2,4), then the second body segment is at old first body position (2,5), and so on, up to the tail. Since food eaten, we add a new segment at the current tail position, so the tail stays, and the new tail is the same as old tail.\n> \n> So positions become: [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ] with 11 segments.\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (2,3), body segments: (2,4), (2,5), etc. (2,4) is adjacent but not the same cell, so no collision. Also, (2,3) was not occupied before, so safe.\n> \n> But there is a food at (2,3), which we eat.\n> \n> Now, other moves:\n> \n> - Move L to (1,4): (1,4) is within bounds, x=1 not border, not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,4), (2,5), etc., no (1,4), so free. No food there, so move to (1,4), no eat, snake moves, tail moves to (3,1)? After move: head to (1,4), body segments shift: old head (2,4) becomes neck, then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (4,1) moves to old position of segment 9, which is (3,1)? Positions: old index 8 is (3,1), index 9 is (4,1). After move, head to (1,4), then index 1: old head (2,4), index 2: old index1 (2,5), ..., up to index 9: old index8 (3,1), and tail old index9 (4,1) is vacated since no food eaten. So new positions: [(1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] with 10 segments, tail at (3,1).\n> \n> - Move R to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by snake body! Snake positions: index 5 is (3,4), which is a body segment. So moving to (3,4) would cause collision with body. Invalid move.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 38: D to (2,3) or L to (1,4)\n> \n> R is invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,1) and (5,4).\n> \n> (2,1) is below, at y=1, and (5,4) at x=5,y=4.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (2,1) life_span=4, so if not eaten by turn 41, it disappears.

But head is at (2,3), and it was moving down to get there.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left?

No: if U is (x,y+1) and that's up, but in top-left coordinate, if (0,0) top-left, then increasing y goes down, so U would be (x,y-1) for up, but here U is (x,y+1), so it must be that (0,0) is bottom-left, with y increasing up.\n> \n> Confirm: U: (x,y+1) — if (0,0) bottom-left, then (x,y+1) is up, north.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) down, south.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) left, west.\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) right, east.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense with positions: head at (2,3), moved D to there, so from (2,4) to (2,3), y decreased, so (2,4) is above (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,1) is below (2,3), since y=1 < y=3.\n> \n> (5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n> \n> Now, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

I'm confused.\n> \n> The positions are listed with head first, so the snake moved from the previous head position to current. But we have the current positions, and head direction is given separately.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it's facing down. So current head is at (2,2), and it's moving down, so next position would be (2,1) if it continues down, but let's see the food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so on turn 41 or 42? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 40, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left: after turn 40, it goes to 1, after turn 41, it goes to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 7, so it will be there for 7 turns from now, until turn 46 or so.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 10, until turn 49 or 50.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,2), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because of no instant reverse. Rules: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move up next. I can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells from x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> It says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid has cells (x,y) with x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but only inner cells are free, I think. For example, (0,0) to (0,7) are walls, similarly (7,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But let's check snake positions: snake has (2,2) to (2,6), and (2,6) is y=6, which is not y=7, so y=6 is playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable? Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free. Similarly x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 free.\n> \n> But snake has (2,6), which is x=2,y=6, and y=6 is not y=7, so it's free. Then (3,6) is also y=6, free. (3,1) is y=1, free. So yes, playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Now, snake body: let's plot the snake to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n> \n> So from head: (2,2) — down to (2,3) — down to (2,4) — down to (2,5) — down to (2,6) — right to (3,6) — up to (3,5) — up to (3,4) — up to (3,3) — up to (3,2) — up to (3,1)\n> \n> (3,2) to (3,1) is up, but (3,2) is the same as head x, but head is at (2,2), different cell. (3,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (3,1), and when the snake moves, the tail will move away, so the cell (3,1) will be free after the snake moves, except if it eats food, it grows.\n> \n> Food at (2,1), which is directly below head? Head at (2,2), (2,1) is below? y=1 < y=2, so if y increases down, (2,1) is above (2,2)? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) top-left, x right, y down. So:\n> \n> - Lower y: higher row, upper part.\n> \n> - Higher y: lower row, bottom.\n> \n> So (2,2) is row 2, column 2.\n> \n> (2,1) is row 1, column 2, which is above (2,2) since y=1 < y=2.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is below (2,2).\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction down, so moving down would go to (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied by the body! Positions: after head (2,2), next is (2,3), so (2,3) is the first body segment. So moving down to (2,3) would collide with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: x-1, so (1,2). Is (1,2) free? Let's see if it's in body or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (1,2): x=1, y=2, not border, so not wall. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (1,2) not in list, so free? But (3,2) is in list, but that's different cell.\n> \n> (1,2) is not in snake positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> Moving right: to (3,2). Now (3,2) is in snake positions? Positions: (3,2) is the second last, before tail. List: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — (3,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Positions: indices: 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,2), 10: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> So (3,2) is position 9, occupied by body.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,3) collides with body.\n> \n> Moving up: to (2,1). But direction is down, and no instant reverse, so moving up is opposite, not allowed. Head direction is D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction D, I can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> D: to (2,3) — occupied, collision.\n> \n> L: to (1,2) — let's check: (1,2) is x=1, y=2, not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (2,2), (2,3), etc., no (1,2), so should be free.\n> \n> R: to (3,2) — occupied by snake at position 9.\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied, so moving there causes collision.\n> \n> But is the tail moving? When snake moves, the tail moves away, but only if it doesn't eat food. If I move to a free cell, the tail moves, so the cell (3,1) will be free after move, but (3,2) is not the tail; the tail is (3,1).\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), which is currently occupied, but since it's not the head moving into it, it's a body segment, so it should cause collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> General rule: head cannot move to any cell occupied by body, except possibly the tail cell if it moves away, but only if I don't eat food.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to tail cell, and tail moves away, it's ok, but only if no food is eaten, because if food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide after growth.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that is the current tail position, and that cell has no food, then after move, tail moves, so no collision. But if that cell has food, eating it causes snake to grow, so tail doesn't move, and head is on tail, collision.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (3,2): (3,2) is not the tail; tail is (3,1). (3,2) is a body segment, so moving to (3,2) would cause collision because it's not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (3,1).\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,3): occupied, collision, death.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,2): not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,2): occupied by body (position 9), not tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,1): but cannot, because opposite direction to current D. Not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (1,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Head direction is D, so moving U is opposite, invalid. Moving D, L, R are possible, but D and R lead to death, so only L is safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1, y=2. x=1 is not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Snake positions: all have x=2 or 3, y from 1 to 6, so (1,2) not in list, so free. Yes.\n> \n> So on this turn, only safe move is L to (1,2).\n> \n> But we need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, action for turn 40.\n> \n> After moving to (1,2), what is the new state?\n> \n> Snake moves to (1,2), head now at (1,2). Since no food eaten (food at (2,1) is not eaten, since we moved to (1,2)), so tail moves: the last segment (3,1) is removed, and new positions: head (1,2), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, so snake: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] and tail (3,1) gone? Positions: original 11 segments, after move, if no food, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Original positions: 11 segments. After moving head to new position, the tail end is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head at (1,2), then the previous segments: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). (3,1) is removed.\n> \n> So positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> Now head direction: we moved left, from (2,2) to (1,2), so x decreased, so direction is now L (left).\n> \n> Food: (2,1) is still there, life span was 2 at turn 40, so after turn 40, it decreases to 1, so on turn 41, it has life span 1, can be eaten on turn 41 before disappearing.\n> \n> Other food: (5,4) life span 7, (6,6) life span 10.\n> \n> Now, on turn 41, head at (1,2), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (opposite). Can move L, U, D.\n> \n> L: to (0,2) — but x=0 is wall, so collision, death.\n> \n> U: to (1,1) — y=1, which is not y=0, so not wall. Is it occupied? Snake positions: new snake has (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc., no (1,1), so free? (1,1) is x=1,y=1, not wall, not in snake, so free.\n> \n> D: to (1,3) — y=3, not wall. Snake positions: has (2,3), but not (1,3), so free.\n> \n> (1,3) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,1), which is adjacent? (1,2) to (2,1) is not directly adjacent; (1,2) and (2,1) are diagonal? No, adjacent means same row or column, differ by one.\n> \n> (1,2) to (2,1): Δx=1, Δy=-1, not adjacent; it's diagonal. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right: (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2). But (2,2) is occupied by body.\n> \n> So from (1,2), adjacent cells: U: (1,1), D: (1,3), L: (0,2) wall, R: (2,2) occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (1,1) or D to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, need to think about eating food.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) is at (2,1), which is not directly accessible from (1,2). To eat it, I need to move to (2,1) from somewhere.\n> \n> (2,1) can be reached from (2,2), (1,1), or (3,1), but (3,1) was tail but now gone.\n> \n> (2,2) is occupied, so I can only reach (2,1) from (1,1) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, or (3,1) which is free now? After turn 40 move, (3,1) is free, but (2,1) is food.\n> \n> To eat (2,1), I need head to move to (2,1).\n> \n> From current head (1,2), I can go to (1,1), then from (1,1) I can go to (2,1), since (1,1) to (2,1) is right, which would be possible.\n> \n> Or from (1,2) go to (1,3), but that might not help to reach (2,1) soon.\n> \n> Food (2,1) has life span 1 on turn 41, meaning after turn 41, it disappears. So it must be eaten on turn 41 or it's gone.\n> \n> Turn 41: if I move to (1,1) on turn 41, head at (1,1), then on turn 42, I can move to (2,1) to eat, but on turn 42, food (2,1) is gone, since life span 1 at turn 41: after turn 41, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So on turn 42, it's not there.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 40, life span 2. After turn 40 (turn ends), life span decreases to 1. On turn 41, if head moves to (2,1), it can be eaten. After turn 41, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 41.\n> \n> If not eaten on turn 41, it's gone.\n> \n> So for (2,1) food, it must be eaten on turn 41.\n> \n> To eat it on turn 41, head must be at (2,1) at turn 41.\n> \n> Current head at turn 40 is at (2,2), but we moved to (1,2) on turn 40.\n> \n> After turn 40, head at (1,2).\n> \n> On turn 41, to be at (2,1), from (1,2), but (1,2) to (2,1) is not a direct move; it's diagonal, not adjacent. I can only move to adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,3), or (0,2) wall, or (2,2) occupied.\n> \n> None of these is (2,1). So from (1,2), I cannot reach (2,1) directly. I need to be at an adjacent cell first.\n> \n> But on turn 41, the only way to reach (2,1) is if head is already adjacent and moves to it.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (2,1) are: (2,2), (2,0) wall, (1,1), (3,1).\n> \n> (2,2) is occupied by snake body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,1) is free, as we moved away.\n> \n> (1,1) is free.\n> \n> So on turn 41, if head is at (1,1), it can move right to (2,1) to eat.\n> \n> If head is at (3,1), it can move left to (2,1).\n> \n> But currently, on turn 40, we moved to (1,2), so on turn 41, head at (1,2).\n> \n> If we move to (1,1) on turn 41, then head at (1,1), which is adjacent to (2,1), so on turn 42, we could move to (2,1), but on turn 42, food is gone, since after turn 41 it disappears.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (2,1) because we cannot reach it on turn 41 from the current position after turn 40 move.\n> \n> On turn 40, head at (2,2), but moving to (2,3) is death, to (3,2) is death, to (1,2) is safe but we go to (1,2).\n> \n> From (2,2), if we could move up to (2,1), but we cannot because direction is down, and moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So on turn 40, we cannot move to (2,1) directly.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (2,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 41 uneaten.\n> \n> So we should ignore it and focus on other food.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 41.\n> \n> Head at (1,2), direction L (since we moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> L: to (0,2) wall, death.\n> \n> U: to (1,1)\n> \n> D: to (1,3)\n> \n> Both safe.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,1) will be gone, so only (5,4) and (6,6).\n> \n> We need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), which might block paths.\n> \n> Current snake positions after turn 40: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> The body is mostly on the left and bottom, but head is at (1,2).\n> \n> To reach other food, like (5,4) or (6,6), we need to navigate.\n> \n> Also, we should avoid risks.\n> \n> First, on turn 41, we need to choose U or D.\n> \n> If we go U to (1,1), or D to (1,3).\n> \n> (1,1) is top-left corner almost, (1,3) is below.\n> \n> Now, the grid has walls around, so we need to be careful not to get trapped.\n> \n> Since we have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's list all free cells or something.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle: (5,2) occupied.\n> \n> Food: (5,4), (6,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n> \n> So occupied cells: those 11.\n> \n> Free cells: all others except walls and obstacle.\n> \n> For example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1) but food, but will be gone, (3,1) free, (4,1) to (6,1), etc.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food, but after turn 41, it might be gone.\n> \n> On turn 41, if we move to (1,1), then we are at (1,1), and (2,1) is adjacent, but we can't eat it on turn 42.\n> \n> If we move to (1,3), we are at (1,3).\n> \n> Now, from there, we can plan to go to (5,4) or (6,6).\n> \n> (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is middle-right, and (6,6) is bottom-right.\n> \n> Life span of (5,4) is 7 at turn 40, so on turn 41, life span 6, plenty of time.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 10, more time.\n> \n> So we can aim for (5,4) first, since it's closer?

on turn 40 avoids body collision and death, as it is the only safe direction. Moving up on turn 41 prevents a future dead end on the bottom-left, and subsequent right moves navigate toward the long-term goal of eating the food at (6,6) within its life span, prioritizing survival over the unreachable or expiring foods at (2,1) and (5,4).\n",

It's turn 41. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), and (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. But the snake and food are within (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me check the snake positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc., all between x=1 to 3, y=2 to 6, so yes, playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=7 is wall, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. Similarly for x.\n> \n> There's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,2), and the body segments are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). Let me list them in order: head (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So the tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1, so it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 41, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (2,1) with life span 1 at turn 41, if not eaten on turn 41, it disappears before turn 42.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) with value 1, life span 6, so it has 6 turns left including turn 41.\n> \n> (6,6) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food here.

Snake positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc. So (2,1) is not in the list, so it's free, I think.\n> \n> But the rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body.

But what is (1,3)? Snake positions: (1,2) head, then (2,2), etc. Is (1,3) occupied? From list: positions are (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So (1,3) is not in list, so empty. y=3 at x=1? Not occupied.\n> \n> - Move D: to (1,1). Is (1,1) occupied? Not in snake positions, so empty. But is it within bounds? x=1, y=1, which is within 1-6, and no wall, walls are borders.\n> \n> - Move L: to (0,2). But x=0 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot move L.\n> \n> Current head at (1,2), move L would be to (0,2), which is x=0, wall, so illegal, dead.

At turn 41, life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 46, it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 41, life span 6, so after turn 41, it has 5 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life span N, after each turn, it decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1.

It's turn 42. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (5,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). That's 11 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since the head is at (1,1) and direction is D, moving down would go to (1,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down is impossible. That means I can't move down because it's a wall.\n> \n> Possible moves: from head position (1,1), current direction D. Since I can't move opposite to current direction instantly, but current direction is D, so I can't move up next? No, the rule is: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is D, which is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. But moving down is to (1,0), which is a wall, so it's invalid anyway.\n> \n> Available moves from (1,1):\n> \n> - Up: to (1,2) – but (1,2) is the second segment, the neck. If I move up, head goes to (1,2), which is occupied by the body, so it would collide. Snake positions: head (1,1), then (1,2) is the first body segment. So moving up to (1,2) would be colliding with body.\n> \n> - Down: to (1,0) – y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,1) – x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,1) – is (2,1) occupied or wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2). So (2,1) should be free? Let me list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> So (2,1) is not in this list. Walls: (0,1) is border, (1,0) border, etc. (2,1) is within 1 to 6 in both x and y, and not (5,2), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions: up to (1,2) is body, down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall, right to (2,1) free.\n> \n> But current direction is D, down. Since down is invalid, and I can't move up because it's opposite and also body, but moving up is opposite to current direction? Current is D (down), opposite is U (up). Rule: cannot move opposite on next turn. So from current state, at turn 42, I cannot move up because it's opposite to D.\n> \n> So possible actions:\n> \n> - Move right: to (2,1)\n> \n> - Move up: but cannot, because opposite direction.\n> \n> - Move down: invalid, wall.\n> \n> - Move left: invalid, wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is right to (2,1). Is that correct?\n> \n> Let me confirm the direction constraint. \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current turn is 42, head direction is D. So for turn 42, I must choose a move that is not opposite to D, so not U.\n> \n> Available cells:\n> \n> - U: (1,2) - occupied by snake body, so collision.\n> \n> - D: (1,0) - wall, collision.\n> \n> - L: (0,1) - wall, collision.\n> \n> - R: (2,1) - not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 42, I have to move right to (2,1). There's no choice; it's the only valid move to avoid death immediately.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will have a new position. When I move right to (2,1), the head moves to (2,1), and the tail will move away from (3,3)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,1) -> moves to (2,1), so new head is (2,1). Then the body: the segment that was at (1,2) will move to where the head was, but since head moved to (2,1), the body segments shift. The second segment (1,2) will become the new position for what was the first body segment, but actually, in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (1,1), 1: (1,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,3), ..., up to 10: (3,3)\n> \n> After moving right to (2,1), new positions: head is now at (2,1). Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (1,1)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment. So:\n> \n> - New head: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was (1,2)) moves to old head position (1,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was (2,2)) moves to old segment 1 position (1,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was (2,3)) moves to (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was (2,4)) moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was (2,5)) moves to (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was (2,6)) moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was (3,6)) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was (3,5)) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was (3,4)) moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 10 (was (3,3)) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> And the tail was (3,3), which moves to where segment 9 was, (3,4)?

No, the snake has 11 segments, so after movement, it should still have 11 segments, but since no food eaten, length unchanged.\n> \n> Positions after move: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> From above: new head (2,1), then body: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> (3,4) is the tail now.\n> \n> Now, head direction after moving right: since I moved right, new head direction should be R (right).\n> \n> Now, turn 42 action is R, to (2,1).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.

access the less crowded upper area, ensuring a path toward the high-value food at (6,6) while avoiding the short-lived food at (5,4) due to its imminent expiration. This sequence maximizes long-term survival by steering clear of the dense body cluster in the bottom-left and positioning for future food opportunities.\n",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), moving right (R). The body segments are: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (1,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (1,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (3,4)\n> \n> The tail is at (3,4). Snake has 11 segments? Positions list has 11 elements: indices 0 to 10. Head at (2,1), tail at (3,4). Let's count: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). That's 11 positions, so snake length is 11.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.

Rule: \"No instant reverse\", so cannot move L.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I move to each option:\n> \n> 1. Move U to (2,2): But (2,2) is occupied by the snake's body segment. Position (2,2) is the third segment? Let's see: positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), then (2,2). So (2,2) is the fourth segment? Indices: 0: (2,1), 1: (1,1), 2: (1,2), 3: (2,2). So (2,2) is occupied by body at index 3. If I move to (2,2), head collides with body, which is deadly. So U is not possible, collision.\n> \n> 2. Move D to (2,0): y=0 is a wall, since border y=0 is wall. So moving to (2,0) hits wall, collision, death.\n> \n> 3. Move R to (3,1): (3,1) is not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). None at (3,1). Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, and (5,2), so (3,1) should be free. Is (3,1) within bounds? x=3, y=1, grid from 0 to 7, so yes. No wall at (3,1). So moving R to (3,1) is safe for now.\n> \n> But only R seems possible? U and D lead to immediate death. So I have to move R to (3,1).\n> \n> Current head at (2,1), move R to (3,1). Then snake will move: new head at (3,1), body follows: the tail at (3,4) will be removed? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food at (3,1), length remains same. So new positions: head (3,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes segment 1, then (1,1) segment 2, (1,2) segment 3, (2,2) segment 4, and so on, up to (3,5) becomes segment 10, and tail (3,4) is removed? Let's list new positions after move R:\n> \n> - New head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then: (2,1)  // previous head\n> \n> - (1,1)  // was segment 1\n> \n> - (1,2)  // segment 2\n> \n> - (2,2)  // segment 3\n> \n> - (2,3)  // segment 4\n> \n> - (2,4)  // segment 5\n> \n> - (2,5)  // segment 6\n> \n> - (2,6)  // segment 7\n> \n> - (3,6)  // segment 8\n> \n> - (3,5)  // segment 9\n> \n> - And (3,4) is removed, so tail is now at (3,5), which was segment 9, but after move, segments are from 0 to 9? Positions: 11 segments, after move without eating, length same, so 10 segments? Initial positions: 11 cells. When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail cell is vacated. So new snake will have the same number of segments, but positions shift.\n> \n> After moving right to (3,1):\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> The last segment (3,4) is gone, and (3,5) is now the tail. So positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). That's 11 positions? (3,1) new head, then 10 more from old, but old had 11 including head, so after move, new head and 10 body segments, but the body segments are the first 10 of the old positions except the tail is removed? Better to think: the snake has a list of positions. When moving without eating, the new position list is: [new_head] + positions[:-1]. So new_head = (3,1), positions[:-1] are all except the last one, so (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). positions[:-1] is from index 0 to 9, which are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). (3,5) is index 9, which was the second last. Then new snake: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). So tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, direction is now R, since we moved right.\n> \n> Food: (5,4) life 5, (6,6) life 7, (3,5) life 10.\n> \n> (3,5) is currently occupied by the snake! In the new positions, (3,5) is the tail. But food at (3,5) with value 1. But it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So currently, at turn 43, food at (3,5) is under the snake's body segment. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (3,5), and then head moves to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) is the tail in the current state? In current state, positions include (3,5) as a body segment? Current snake positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]. So (3,5) is index 9, a body segment, and (3,4) is tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under the body at index 9.\n> \n> After we move to (3,1), the new positions have (3,5) as the tail.\n> \n> In new state after move, (3,5) is tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is still there, but now under tail.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the tail to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> But tail moves when snake moves without eating.\n> \n> Life span of food at (3,5) is 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns, but countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Current turn 43, life span 10, so it disappears after turn 43 + 10 = 53? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life span 10, so it has 10 turns left including this one? Let's see the rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,5) with life_span 10 at turn 43, after turn 43, countdown to 9, then after turn 44 to 8, ..., after turn 52, countdown to 0, disappears before turn 53? At turn t, life_span L, it will be present for L more turns, disappearing at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something? Better to think: after each turn, countdown decreases by 1. At turn 43, it has life_span 10, meaning it will decrease to 9 after turn 43, to 8 after turn 44, ..., to 0 after turn 52, so it disappears after turn 52, before turn 53. So it can be eaten from turn 43 to 52 inclusive? At the start of turn 43, life_span 10, so it can be eaten during turn 43. After eating or after turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> Typically in such games, food is present at the beginning of the turn, and if head moves to it during the turn, it is eaten. Then after the turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", which might imply that at the end of the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> To be safe, I'll assume that at turn t, food with life_span L can be eaten if head moves to it, and after the turn, life_span becomes L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Back to action.\n> \n> At turn 43, I must move R to (3,1) to avoid death, since U and D are fatal.\n> \n> So action for turn 43: R\n> \n> Now, after move, head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Now, for turn 44, I need to plan ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid and snake for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, walls at borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions after turn 43 move: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,4) life span: at turn 43, it was 5, after turn 43 decreases to 4?

Yes, countdown decreases every turn including current, so after turn 43, life span: (5,4) 4, (6,6) 6, (3,5) 9.\n> \n> Similarly, after each turn.\n> \n> Now for turn 44, head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R (since direction R, cannot L).\n> \n> - U: (3,1+1) = (3,2)\n> \n> - D: (3,1-1) = (3,0) but y=0 wall, death\n> \n> - R: (4,1)\n> \n> - L: (2,1) but opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible: U or R.\n> \n> (3,2): is it occupied?

(5,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is clear.

After turn 43, life span 4 for (5,4), meaning it can be eaten until turn 46?

It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8 cells wide and 8 high. x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly for y.\n> \n> There's an internal obstacle at (5,2), so I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,2), then body segments: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), and tail at (3,6). So the snake has 11 segments. Let me count: positions are from index 0 to 10, so 11 segments. Head is (3,2), tail is (3,6).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this turn. Since turn 45, it will disappear after turn 47? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 45, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left: turn 45, 46, 47. After turn 47, it's gone. Similarly for others.\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 5. So it will last until turn 49 (45+4? Let's calculate: at turn 45, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turns 45,46,47,48,49? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1. For example, at turn t, life span N: after turn t, it decreases to N-1; if N-1>0, it remains, and so on, until life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard: at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be present for L turns, including t. So last turn it can be eaten is t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (5,4): at turn 45, life span 3, so it can be eaten on turn 45,46,47.

Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n> \n> So the snake body forms a sort of loop or path. Let's plot:\n> \n> At y=2: x=3 (head), then (1,2) and (2,2)? Positions: (3,2) head, then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> So from head (3,2) down to (3,1), left to (2,1), left to (1,1), up to (1,2)? (1,1) to (1,2) is up? y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 at bottom, but in coordinates, it might vary, but here U is (x,y+1), so y increases as we go up. Similarly D is (x,y-1), down.\n> \n> In the positions, head at (3,2) direction U, so moving up.\n> \n> Now, body: (3,1) is below (3,2) since y=1 < y=2, so south. Then (2,1) is west of (3,1), so left. Then (1,1) west of (2,1), left. Then (1,2) north of (1,1), up. Then (2,2) east of (1,2), right. Then (2,3) north of (2,2), up. Then (2,4) up, (2,5) up, (2,6) up, then (3,6) east of (2,6), right.\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around. Specifically, from (3,2) down to (3,1), left to (1,1), up to (1,2), right to (2,2), up to (2,6), then right to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (5,4): this is east and north from head?

But snake has segments at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so (3,5) might be near the body.\n> \n> (3,5) is food, but snake has positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). (3,5) is not occupied by snake? Let's see snake positions: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So cells occupied: all these.\n> \n> (3,5) is not in the list, so it's free. Similarly, (5,4) and (6,6) are free.\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5. Snake has (2,5), (3,6), but not (3,5). (2,5) is at y=5,x=2, (3,6) at x=3,y=6. So (3,5) is adjacent to both? (2,5) is left, (3,6) is below if y increases up? y=6 > y=5, so (3,6) is above (3,5)? U is (x,y+1), so higher y is north.\n> \n> y=5: (3,5) food.\n> \n> Snake: (2,5) at x=2,y=5, (2,6) at x=2,y=6, (3,6) at x=3,y=6.\n> \n> So (3,5) is north of (3,6)? (3,6) is at y=6, so (3,5) is south of it? y=5 < y=6, so (3,5) is below (3,6).\n> \n> Since U is (x,y+1), increasing y is up, decreasing y is down.\n> \n> So (3,6) is at higher y, so north.\n> \n> (3,5) at y=5, so south of (3,6).\n> \n> And (2,5) at same y=5, x=2.\n> \n> (3,5) is adjacent to (2,5) and (3,6), but not occupied, so food can be there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) at x=5,y=4.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is south.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns. The answer should include an action sequence for turns 45,46,47,... and I should think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D because no instant reverse. Current direction U, so cannot go D (opposite).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U: to (3,3)\n> \n> - D: not possible, opposite direction.\n> \n> - L: to (2,2)\n> \n> - R: to (4,2)\n> \n> But (2,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (2,2), which is a body segment.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), ... so (2,2) is the sixth segment? Index 0: (3,2) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (2,1), index 3: (1,1), index 4: (1,2), index 5: (2,2), index 6: (2,3), etc.\n> \n> So (2,2) is occupied by the snake body. If I move left to (2,2), it's a collision, since head touches body segment, except if it's the tail, but tail is at (3,6), not here.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, moving to (2,2), which is not the tail; tail is (3,6). So moving to (2,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (4,2): what is there? No wall, no snake? Snake positions: all listed, no (4,2), so it might be free.\n> \n> Moving up to (3,3): is it free? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), etc., no (3,3) listed, so free.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (4,2) is within 1-6? x=4, y=2, x from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So (4,2) is not border, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3) free.\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,2) direction U:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) - free\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) - occupied, collision\n> \n> - R: to (4,2) - free\n> \n> D not possible.\n> \n> So only U or R are safe immediate moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and long-term.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5) at (3,5), value 1, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> - (5,4) at (5,4), value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 47.\n> \n> - (6,6) at (6,6), value 1, life span 5, by turn 49.\n> \n> Also, tail at (3,6), and food at (3,5) is directly below tail? (3,5) is at y=5, tail at (3,6) y=6, so (3,5) is south of tail.\n> \n> If I go to eat (3,5), I need to be careful because of \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is food, and tail is at (3,6). If I move head to (3,5), when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, but since I eat, the tail stays, and new segment is added, so head at (3,5), and tail still at (3,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move that turn. So if head moves to food cell, it eats, grows, so the segment that was tail remains, and head is on food.\n> \n> But in this case, food at (3,5), tail at (3,6). If head moves to (3,5), it eats, grows, so now the snake has head at (3,5), and tail at (3,6), with a new segment? After eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake becomes longer.\n> \n> Specifically: before move, positions: [head, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves old position.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to food, eats, so new head position is food, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,5) which has food, then after eating, positions: new head at (3,5), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, etc., and tail remains at (3,6) since it didn't move. So now snake has head at (3,5), and tail at (3,6), which are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Now, the danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, but in this case, the food is at (3,5), which head just ate, so the tail cell (3,6) does not have food; the food was at (3,5) and is now eaten.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> But here, the food is not on the tail cell; it's on a different cell.\n> \n> (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (3,6).\n> \n> So when I eat (3,5), head moves there, tail is at (3,6), which is adjacent (up), but the tail cell (3,6) does not have food, so no immediate danger from that rule.\n> \n> The rule applies only if the food is on the tail cell itself, I think.\n> \n> Read carefully: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> So it requires two things: head adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (3,5), head is at (3,5), tail at (3,6), so they are adjacent, but the tail cell (3,6) does not have food; it's just a body segment now. The food was at (3,5), eaten and gone.\n> \n> So no issue here.\n> \n> The danger is only if the food is on the tail cell, and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision because after eating, tail stays, head is on food, but since head was adjacent, now head and tail are on adjacent cells, but after growth, tail doesn't move, so they are still adjacent, but not necessarily colliding unless they are on same cell.\n> \n> Collision if head touches body, but tail is part of body.\n> \n> If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, when you move head to tail cell to eat, but tail cell is occupied by tail, so normally you can't move there if occupied, unless it's tail and you can move there because tail moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> And \"Tail Reward Danger\": \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Ah, so this is for the case when food is under the tail.\n> \n> In this state, food at (3,5) is not under tail; tail is at (3,6), so (3,5) is free, no food under body here.\n> \n> Similarly, other food not under body.\n> \n> So for (3,5), no such danger.\n> \n> Back to immediate moves.\n> \n> From (3,2), I can go U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n> \n> I need to think about getting food, especially (5,4) which has short life span, only 3 turns left.\n> \n> Turn 45: life span 3, so can be eaten on 45,46,47.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) has more time, (3,5) has plenty.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Current snake position: the area around head is a bit cramped.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2)\n> \n> Snake: positions:\n> \n> y=1: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)\n> \n> y=2: (3,2) head, (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> y=3: (2,3)\n> \n> y=4: (2,4)\n> \n> y=5: (2,5), and food at (3,5)\n> \n> y=6: (2,6), (3,6) tail\n> \n> Also, (1,2) is at y=2,x=1, etc.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,2), can go to (3,3) or (4,2).\n> \n> (3,3) is free, (4,2) is free.\n> \n> If I go up to (3,3), then from there I can go U to (3,4), L to (2,3), or R to (4,3).\n> \n> (2,3) is occupied by snake body?

It's turn 46. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake positions are: head at (3,3), then body segments at (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake is 11 segments long.

But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Since the head is moving up, current direction is U. I can't instantly reverse, so I can't move down on the next turn. Possible moves are U, L, R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so grid from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think. But (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since (1,1) to (6,6). (1,1) is occupied by the snake, but it's a valid cell.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So let's list the coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (1,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (1,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,3)  // this is one below head?

So the tail is at (2,6).\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life span 2, so after this turn, it has 1 turn left? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 46, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 47? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard way: if food has life span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the start of turn t + N?\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten during turn t, and if not eaten, life span decreases to L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (5,4) with life span 2 at turn 46: on turn 46, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 for turn 47.

Snake positions: (2,3) is a body segment. But according to rules, moving to the tail cell is allowed if the tail moves away.

But segment 7 is not the tail; the tail is (2,6). So moving to (2,3) would collide with the body segment that is not the tail, so it should be deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only moving to the tail cell is safe, because the tail moves.

Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 46 start: snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): head moves to (3,4), then each body segment moves to previous position, so:\n> \n> New head: (3,4)\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to old head (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old seg1 (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 3 to old seg2 (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 to old seg3 (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 5 to old seg4 (1,1)\n> \n> Segment 6 to old seg5 (1,2)\n> \n> Segment 7 to old seg6 (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 8 to old seg7 (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 9 to old seg8 (2,4)\n> \n> Segment 10 (tail) to old seg9 (2,5)\n> \n> Old tail (2,6) is left, so tail is now at (2,5), and (2,6) is free.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)\n> \n> Length still 11.\n> \n> Now, on turn 47, from (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> Can move U to (3,5), which has food.\n> \n> (3,5) is a food position, value +1.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), I eat the food, so snake grows, new tail added.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head to (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and new segment, so tail at (2,5), but new tail will be added, so positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), ..., up to (2,5), and then the new tail is where? When eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move, but a new segment is attached.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move without eating, tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to new cell, body follows, but tail stays in place, so new segment is added.\n> \n> For example: from above, before move to (3,5), positions: head (3,4), body down to (2,5)\n> \n> After move U to (3,5): head to (3,5), then body segments move to previous positions: first body to old head (3,4), second to old first body (3,3), ..., up to the last body to old second last body.\n> \n> Since we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail position doesn't change; instead, the new head position is added, and the tail remains.\n> \n> So positions become: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)  // (2,5) is still there, and since we eat, we add a new segment at the tail end? No.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head to new cell, each body segment to previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food cell, body segments follow to their next positions, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively, the snake grows.\n> \n> After move with eat: head at new cell, the body segments are the old head and all old body segments, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> After move to new cell N (with food): new head N, then P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk. So positions: N, P0, P1, ..., Pk, length increased by one.\n> \n> In this case, before turn 47, positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> After move U to (3,5) with food: new head (3,5), then old head (3,4), then old body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) and since eaten, add new segment at the end, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and new tail at (2,5)? No: the new segment is added at the position of the old tail, but since the tail moved? In the sequence, after move, the body includes all old positions plus the head moved, but with eat, the tail stays.\n> \n> Positions before move: let's index from head: S0 = (3,4), S1 = (3,3), S2 = (3,2), S3 = (3,1), S4 = (2,1), S5 = (1,1), S6 = (1,2), S7 = (2,2), S8 = (2,3), S9 = (2,4), S10 = (2,5)\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) with food: new S0 = (3,5), then S1 = old S0 = (3,4), S2 = old S1 = (3,3), S3 = old S2 = (3,2), S4 = old S3 = (3,1), S5 = old S4 = (2,1), S6 = old S5 = (1,1), S7 = old S6 = (1,2), S8 = old S7 = (2,2), S9 = old S8 = (2,3), S10 = old S9 = (2,4), and since food eaten, add a new segment at old tail position, so S11 = old S10 = (2,5)\n> \n> So new tail at (2,5), and the old tail position (2,5) is now occupied by the new segment, but it's the same cell? S10 was (2,5), after move, S10 is (2,4), and S11 is (2,5), so the cell (2,5) is still occupied, but by the new tail.\n> \n> In terms of the grid, after eating, (3,5) is head, and (2,5) is tail.\n> \n> Back to the move: from (3,4), moving U to (3,5) is possible, and (3,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But is it safe? (3,5) is free now, no body there. After moving to (3,4), the snake doesn't occupy (3,5), so it's free to move.\n> \n> But there's a danger: tail reward danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, after moving to (3,4), tail is at (2,5). Head at (3,4), tail at (2,5), which are adjacent? (3,4) and (2,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right. (3,4) to (2,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (3,4) with (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), etc. (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,4); it's diagonal.\n> \n> So not adjacent, so no tail reward danger for eating (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, for other food.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) on turn 47 seems fine.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> First, on turn 46, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Options: U to (3,4) or R to (4,3)\n> \n> If I go U to (3,4), then on turn 47, I can go U to (3,5) to eat food.\n> \n> (3,5) has life span 7, so not urgent.\n> \n> But there's (5,4) with life span 2, so I need to eat it soon.\n> \n> (5,4) at (5,4), from (3,3), how to get there?\n> \n> If I go R to (4,3) on turn 46.\n> \n> Then from (4,3), I can go to (5,4) or other places.\n> \n> Let's evaluate both options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (3,4) on turn 46.\n> \n> Then turn 47: at (3,4), direction U, move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n> \n> After eating (3,5), snake grows to length 12.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)?

It's turn 47, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score while avoiding risks. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake positions are: head at (3,4), then body segments at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). That's 11 segments, so the snake is 11 units long.

No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize. The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> List all snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> (2,5) is the tail, I assume, since it's last.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: head first, then body to tail. So index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (3,3), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (3,1), index 4: (2,1), index 5: (1,1), index 6: (1,2), index 7: (2,2), index 8: (2,3), index 9: (2,4), index 10: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction is Up, so current movement is increasing y-coordinate.\n> \n> Possible moves from head position (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by the body segment, and since the snake is moving, if I go down to (3,3), that's where the neck is, but after moving, the body will shift, so I need to think about collisions.\n> \n> Collision rules: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves when the head moves forward. Specifically, when the head moves to a new cell, if that cell is not the tail, it's a collision. But if it is the tail, it's okay because the tail will move away.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, so possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,4), I can go:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, check what's on these cells.\n> \n> First, (3,5): is there food? Food at (3,5) is listed with life span 6, value 1. Also, is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,5) is not in the list, so it should be free. But let's confirm: positions are (3,4), (3,3), etc., no (3,5), so yes, free.\n> \n> (2,4): is that occupied? Snake has (2,4) at index 9, which is a body segment. But (2,4) is occupied now, so if I move left to (2,4), that's a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,5). So moving to (2,4) would cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): is it occupied? Not in snake positions, and not a wall, so free? Walls are borders and (5,2), so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (4,4) is within 1 to 6 in both x and y? Grid from 0 to 7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n> \n> (4,4): x=4, y=4, not border, not (5,2), so free.\n> \n> Snake positions: no (4,4), so free.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is occupied by snake body at index 9, which is not tail; tail is (2,5). So moving to (2,4) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,5) is free, as per food list.\n> \n> (3,5) has food, but let's see the cells.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) - free, and has food (value 1, life 6)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4) - occupied by body, collision if moved to\n> \n> - R: to (4,4) - free, no food mentioned\n> \n> Food positions: (5,4), (6,6), (3,5), (5,5)\n> \n> So (4,4) has no food.\n> \n> Now, since moving to (2,4) causes collision, I cannot move Left. Only possible safe moves are Up or Right.\n> \n> Up to (3,5) or Right to (4,4).\n> \n> But Up to (3,5) has food.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (5,4) with life span 1, meaning if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 47, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> Similarly, others have more life.\n> \n> Now, if I move Up to (3,5), I eat the food there, snake grows to length 12, and tail stays or moves? When you eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail remains in place, and new segment added where head was, I think? Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> From rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, snake grows, so the position where head was becomes new body, and tail stays put.\n> \n> Then next turn, when moving, tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,5), which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (3,5), and the previous head (3,4) becomes part of body, tail (2,5) remains, so snake positions become: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)] — tail still (2,5), but now there are 12 segments.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (3,5), then (3,4) (which was head), (3,3), ..., up to (2,5), so 11 positions? Let's count.\n> \n> Original: 11 positions. After eating, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move. So length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose current positions: head, body1, body2, ..., tail.\n> \n> After moving and eating: new head at food cell, old head becomes body, all body shifts, but tail stays, so new positions: new head, old head, body1, ..., body-last, tail (same as before), and a new segment is added at tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food cell, but tail does not move, so the cell that was tail remains, and a new segment is there, so length increases.\n> \n> For example: snake: H at A, B at B, T at C.\n> \n> Move to new cell D without food: new H at D, B at A (old H), T at B (old B), C is free.\n> \n> Move to food at D: eat, new H at D, new body at A (old H), B at B (but B was body, now it's still body), T at C, but since tail didn't move, C is still occupied, and length increased, so positions: H at D, body at A, body at B, tail at C. So from A,B,C to D,A,B,C — four segments now.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them for clarity.\n> \n> Turn 47, positions: P0: (3,4) head, P1: (3,3), P2: (3,2), P3: (3,1), P4: (2,1), P5: (1,1), P6: (1,2), P7: (2,2), P8: (2,3), P9: (2,4), P10: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move Up to (3,5) and eat food there:\n> \n> New head at (3,5), old head (3,4) becomes new body segment, so P0 new: (3,5)\n> \n> Then P1: (3,4)  // old P0\n> \n> P2: (3,3)  // old P1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> P10: (2,4)  // old P9\n> \n> P11: (2,5)  // new segment, since tail didn't move, (2,5) is still occupied, but with a new segment?

It's turn 48, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So the snake has 12 segments. The head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to (3,5) from (3,4), I assume? Positions are listed head first, so from (3,5) to (2,5) is the tail. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) as tail.\n> \n> The head direction is U, so it's facing Up. Moving Up would decrease y, I think? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The state says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so moving Up increases y, Down decreases y? That might be counterintuitive.\n> \n> Look: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so if U is up, y+1 means y increases as you go up, so (0,0) is bottom-left? But borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — up, increasing y\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x\n> \n> Snake head at (3,5), direction U, so it came from (3,4) since moving up to (3,5) would be from lower y to higher y. Positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), so yes, it moved from (3,4) to (3,5) with U, so (3,4) to (3,5) is +y, so U is increasing y.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,6,3,1) — I think this is (x,y, life_span, value).

Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 6, 3, 1) - (5, 5, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> In the description, it says: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in input, it's written as (x,y, life_span, value)? No: \" (6, 6, 3, 1) \" and it says \"Value and Life Span\", but the numbers are given as x,y, then two numbers.\n> \n> Read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 6, 3, 1) - (5, 5, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> Here it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The text says \"Life Span and Value\" but then the tuple has four numbers: x,y, then two more.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span). Let's see the values: (6,6,3,1) and (5,5,8,1). Value should be +1 or -1 for positive/negative food. Here, both have last number 1, which is value? And the third number is life_span.\n> \n> For (6,6,3,1): x=6,y=6, life_span=3, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5,8,1): x=5,y=5, life_span=8, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food with value +1.\n> \n> Life_span: for (6,6) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 48, life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 50? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after (t + L - 1) or something? Example: if at turn t, life_span=L, then after L turns, it's gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, after the turn, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then after that turn it disappears.\n> \n> Standard: at start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present during turn t, and at end of turn, if life_span decreases, so after turn t, life_span becomes L-1. If life_span=1, it is present during the turn, but disappears after the turn before next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the food has remaining life L, then during turn t, it can be eaten. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If after decrease L=0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> Similarly here, at turn 48, for (6,6): life_span=3, so it can be eaten on turns 48,49,50. After turn 50, it disappears.\n> \n> For (5,5): life_span=8, so it will last until turn 55 (since 48 to 55 is 8 turns? Let's calculate: turn 48: L=8, after turn 48, L=7; turn 49: L=7, ... after turn 55: L=0, disappear before turn 56? Turns: at turn t, L is the remaining life.\n> \n> At turn 48, L=8 for (5,5), so after turn 48, L=7; ... after turn 54, L=1; during turn 55, L=1, after turn 55, L=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 48 to 55 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) L=3 at turn 48, so eaten during 48,49,50; after turn 50, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction U.

Turn 48,49,50 it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) has more time.\n> \n> But (6,6) is closer?

Snake positions: (2,5) is part of the body, it's the second last segment? Positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), ..., down to (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So (2,5) is the tail? Let's see the list: indices 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (1,1), 7: (1,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> So (2,5) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Now, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so if head moves to a new cell, tail leaves its cell, so cells are freed except when growing by eating.\n> \n> For move options at (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6). Is this valid? y=6, which is not wall, y=7 is top wall, but y=6 is within 0-7. (3,6) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all have y<=5 except head, but head is at (3,5), so (3,6) is empty. Also, no wall there. So U is possible.\n> \n> - D: to (3,4). But (3,4) is occupied by the body segment. Since it's the second segment, if head moves to (3,4), it would collide with body, because (3,4) is not the tail; the tail is (2,5). After move, the body segments follow, so if head moves to (3,4), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, so collision. Therefore, D is invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (2,5). (2,5) is currently the tail. Since it's the tail, when head moves to (2,5), the tail will move away, so it should be ok, as long as no other body part is there. But (2,5) is occupied by the tail, and after move, the tail moves to the next segment, so (2,5) is freed, and head can move there without collision. Only if it were not the tail, it would be collision. Here, (2,5) is tail, so moving to tail is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> Similarly, R: to (4,5). (4,5) is empty? Let's see, no food or snake there. x=4,y=5, not in positions, so empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, but x=4,y=5 is not border, internal obstacle at (5,2), not here. So R is possible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5) with direction U: U, L, R. D is invalid and also opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) life 3, so must be eaten by turn 50.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) life 8, more time.\n> \n> (5,5) is closer and easier to reach.\n> \n> From (3,5), moving R to (4,5) gets closer to (5,5).\n> \n> Then from (4,5), can move R to (5,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But (5,5) is food, so if head moves to (5,5), it eats it, length increases.\n> \n> Now, what about the direction? After moving R, head direction becomes R, so then can move U, D, R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, for (6,6), it's at (6,6), which requires moving to (5,5) then (6,6) or something.\n> \n> But (6,6) has short life, so should prioritize eating it soon.\n> \n> But (5,5) is closer and on the way.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's see if we can eat (5,5) quickly.\n> \n> Turn 48: from (3,5), move R to (4,5). Direction was U, now moving R, so new direction R.\n> \n> Then turn 49: from (4,5), move R to (5,5). Since (5,5) has food, eat it, snake grows to 13 segments. Head now at (5,5), direction R.\n> \n> Now, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment added, positions: new head at (5,5), previous head was (4,5) now body, and tail stays until next move? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> So after turn 49, snake positions: head (5,5), then previous body: (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), ..., and tail (2,5) still there? Let's list.\n> \n> After turn 48: moved R to (4,5). Since no food eaten, tail moves: head to (4,5), then body segments: first body was (3,5) now at position 1, then (3,4) at 2, etc., and tail (2,5) moves? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: after move to (4,5), the new positions: head (4,5), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), and tail was (2,5), but since no grow, tail is removed? No: the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: after moving head to (4,5), the first body segment moves to the old head position (3,5), second body to old first body (3,4), and so on, down to the tail: the segment before tail was (2,4) which moves to (2,5)? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (1,1), 7: (1,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5) (without eating), the new head is (4,5), then body 1: old head (3,5), body 2: old body1 (3,4), body 3: old body2 (3,3), ..., body 11: old body10 (2,4), and tail is old body11 (2,5)? Body indices: after move, position 0: new head (4,5), position 1: old position 0 (3,5), position 2: old position 1 (3,4), ..., position 11: old position 10 (2,4), and old position 11 (2,5) is no longer part of snake, so vacated.\n> \n> Thus, tail is now at (2,4), but position 11 is (2,4), which was previously occupied by the segment that moved.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) tail. Length still 12.\n> \n> Now turn 49: from (4,5), move R to (5,5). (5,5) has food, so eat it. Head moves to (5,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new segment added. Positions: head (5,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and all body segments stay, plus the new segment at the tail position? When eating, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> Standard: head moves to new cell (with food), all body segments move to their next position, but since growing, the tail doesn't vacate; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: when moving to a cell with food, the head moves to that cell, the body segments follow as usual, but since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake increases in length by one. So the new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> After move: head at new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, but for the tail, since no move, it stays.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving head to food cell, the new positions are: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, then all previous body positions except the tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions [A(head), B, C(tail)]. Move to food at D. Head moves to D, B moves to A, C stays at C, so new positions [D, A, C], length increased, C is still tail? But then the segment between head and tail is A.\n> \n> In list: old: [A, B, C] with C tail.\n> \n> After moving to food D: head to D, then B moves to where A was, but since no tail move, C stays. So new positions: [D, A, B, C]? That can't be right because B was behind A, now A is behind D, B should move to A's old position.\n> \n> Standard: when moving without eating: head to new, each segment to position of previous segment.\n> \n> With eating: head to new (food), each segment to position of previous segment, but the last segment (tail) does not leave, so the segment that was before tail moves to tail's position, and tail stays, but that means two segments at same position? Messy.\n> \n> I think it's: after moving to food, the snake grows, so the new position list includes the new head position and all old positions except the tail is not removed; all segments are kept, with the tail being the same as before, but since the head moved, the body shifted.\n> \n> Perhaps: the body moves as if no grow, but then we add a new segment at the tail position.\n> \n> In movement: the head moves to the new cell (with food). Then, the first body segment moves to the old head cell. The second body segment moves to the old first body cell, and so on. Since we are growing, we do not remove the tail cell; instead, we keep it, so the tail segment remains in place, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> For example: positions before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> Move to food F: head to F, B1 moves to H, B2 moves to B1's position, but B2 was at position, say P, moves to where B1 was. Then T, since growing, T does not move, so it stays at its position. So new positions: [F, H, B1, T] where T is still there, but B1 moved to H, so the segment that was B1 is now at H, B2 was at B1 old position, but in this case, after move, positions are: head F, then H (which was head, now body), then B1 (which moved to H, but H is occupied), let's think of the positions.\n> \n> Better to think of the list: old positions: index 0: H, 1: B1, 2: B2, 3: T\n> \n> After moving to food F with growth: new head at F (index 0 new), then the body at old index 0 position (H) becomes new index 1, the body at old index 1 position (B1) becomes new index 2, the body at old index 2 position (B2) becomes new index 3, and since growing, we add a new segment at the old tail position T, so new index 4 at T. But the old tail T was at position, and now we have a new segment there, so the tail is the new segment at T.\n> \n> Positions: new 0: F, new 1: old0 (H), new 2: old1 (B1), new 3: old2 (B2), new 4: old3 (T) but old3 is T, so new segment at T.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell T is still occupied, but by the new tail.\n> \n> In this case, the snake extends.\n> \n> For our case, after turn 49: move to (5,5) with food, so head to (5,5), then the previous positions: old head (4,5) becomes body, old body1 (3,5) becomes next, and so on, down to old tail (2,4) becomes body, and new tail at old tail position (2,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> Before turn 49: positions at start of turn 49: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5) and eating: new head (5,5), new body1: old head position (4,5), new body2: old body1 position (3,5), new body3: old body2 position (3,4), ..., new body11: old body10 position (2,3), and since growing, new tail at old tail position (2,4). Old body10 was (2,3), which becomes new body11, and old tail (2,4) position gets a new segment, so new tail at (2,4).\n> \n> But (2,4) was the old tail position, so it's still occupied.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) tail.

That's 12 segments, so the snake is 12 units long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 49, for (6,6), life span is 2, so it disappears after turn 50? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So, at the start of turn 49, life span is given. After turn 49, it decreases by 1, so at turn 50, it would be life_span - 1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 2 at turn 49. After turn 49, it decreases to 1. After turn 50, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 49 or 50, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): life span 7, so it will last until turn 49 + 7 - 1 = turn 55? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L means it will disappear after L turns from now. So:\n> \n> - After turn t, L decreases by 1 to L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L decreases to L-2, and so on.\n> \n> - When L reaches 0 after a turn, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 49, L=2: it exists during turn 49 and 50. After turn 50, L=0, so it disappears before turn 51.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) L=7: exists from turn 49 to turn 49 + 6 = turn 55? Turn 49: L=7, after turn 49: L=6, ..., after turn 55: L=0, disappears before turn 56. So it can be eaten from turn 49 to turn 55.\n> \n> Turn numbers: at start of turn 49, L=7. After turn 49 is processed, L=6. ... After turn 55 is processed, L=0, so before turn 56, it's gone. So last chance to eat is turn 55.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2) L=10: exists from turn 49 to turn 58, last eaten on turn 58.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 49 onwards. But since food has different life spans, I should consider which ones are urgent.\n> \n> First, (6,6) must be eaten by turn 50, or it's gone. Turn 49 or 50.\n> \n> (5,5) has until turn 55, so less urgent.\n> \n> (6,2) has until turn 58, plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but I have to avoid risks and think long-term.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on this turn, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So available moves: U, D, R. (L is opposite to R, so not allowed.)\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid, indices from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so 8x8 cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> Now, food at: (6,6), (5,5), (6,2)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate options for turn 49:\n> \n> From (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,6)\n> \n> - D: to (4,4)\n> \n> - R: to (5,5)\n> \n> R to (5,5): (5,5) has food! And it's positive, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But is it safe?\n> \n> (5,5) is not occupied by snake body? Let's see snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n> \n> (5,5) is not in this list, so it's free. Also, not a wall. Walls are borders and (5,2), so (5,5) is safe.\n> \n> But moving R to (5,5) would eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, other moves: U to (4,6): is that safe? (4,6) is within bounds, x=4 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Not an obstacle. Not in snake body? Body has (4,5) but that's head now, moving away. (4,6) not in positions, so safe.\n> \n> D to (4,4): similarly, (4,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> Now, but (5,5) has food, so moving R gives +1 score immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) has food with short life, only 2 turns left, so I might want to get it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is farther.\n> \n> But let's see the board.\n> \n> Current head (4,5). Food at (5,5) which is adjacent east.\n> \n> (6,6) is northeast, (6,2) is southeast but with obstacle.\n> \n> (6,2) is at y=2, x=6, but there's an obstacle at (5,2), which is directly west of (6,2), but (6,2) itself might be accessible? (5,2) is blocked, but (6,2) is not a wall, so it should be accessible if I can get there.\n> \n> But let's map the grid.\n> \n> I should sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Columns x=0 to 7, rows y=0 to 7.\n> \n> y=0 bottom? Usually in coordinates, y increases up or down? In the problem, it says U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Or is y=0 top? Let's see.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) so if y increases, it's upward direction. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In computer graphics, often y=0 top, but here U is y+1, so if y=0 is bottom, U to y+1 is up; if y=0 is top, U to y+1 is down. But the problem doesn't specify, but from walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so it doesn't matter, as long as consistent.\n> \n> In positions, snake has (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), etc., and food at (6,6), (5,5), (6,2), with y=6 and y=2, so y=6 is high, y=2 low, so probably y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so U increases y.\n> \n> Similarly, D decreases y.\n> \n> So, head at (4,5), which is middle-right.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) at east, adjacent\n> \n> - (6,6) at northeast, not adjacent; from (4,5) to (6,6) is not adjacent, need two moves: e.g., R then U, or U then R, etc.\n> \n> - (6,2) at southeast, y=2, x=6.\n> \n> But there's obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (6,2), I need to go around, since (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 49.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (5,5) - eat food, grow to length 13.\n> \n> Then, new head at (5,5), direction R.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move that turn? No, when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays, meaning the new segment is added at the head position after move.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move to food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn. So length increases.\n> \n> If not food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> Here, if I move to (5,5), which has food, so head moves to (5,5), food eaten, new segment added there, so snake positions become: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), ..., up to tail (2,4)] but since we add a segment, the body includes the previous head, so positions: new head (5,5), then previous head (4,5), then (3,5), etc., down to (2,4), and since we ate, tail doesn't move, so (2,4) stays, and we have one more segment, so length 13.\n> \n> Positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ] — that's 13 positions.\n> \n> Now, after that, on turn 50, I need to move from (5,5).\n> \n> Direction is now R, since I moved right.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (5,6), D (5,4), L (4,5), R (6,5)\n> \n> But L is opposite to current direction R?

It's turn 51. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (6,5).\n> \n> Food: only one piece at (6,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Since it's turn 51, and life span decreases every turn including current, this food will disappear after 9 turns, so by turn 60.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls at borders and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake body: from head (6,5) to tail (2,3). Let's list all positions to visualize:\n> \n> - Head: (6,5)\n> \n> - Body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (6,2). That's directly below the head? Head is at (6,5), food at (6,2), so same x, different y. Distance in y is 3 cells down.\n> \n> Since head is at (6,5) and direction is R, moving right would go to (7,5), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right is impossible. Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so (7,5) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (6,6) but y=6, since y=7 is wall, y=6 should be ok? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y from 0 to 7 inclusive? Typically in grids, if walls are at y=0 and y=7, cells from y=1 to y=6 might be playable? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The walls are described as \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So for a cell (x,y), if x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, it's a wall. Internal (5,2) is also wall.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), which is not a wall.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,5+1) = (6,6) – is this valid? y=6, y=7 is wall, so y=6 should be ok? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free? No: the wall cells are y=0 and y=7, meaning those coordinates are occupied by walls. So for movement, if y=6, it should be free, since y=6 != 0 and !=7. Similarly, x=6, x=7 is wall, so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, but (6,6) has x=6 !=7, y=6 !=0 and !=7, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - D: (6,5-1) = (6,4) – y=4, not wall.\n> \n> - L: (6-1,5) = (5,5) – but (5,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (5,5) is the second segment, so it's part of the body. But in snake games, you can move into the tail cell only if the tail moves away, but here it's not the tail.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for any body segment except the tail, touching it causes collision. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because when you move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) – check if wall or body.\n> \n> (6,6): not wall, as above. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). None of these are (6,6), so free cell.\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) – not wall, not in snake positions? (6,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - L: to (5,5) – (5,5) is occupied by snake body. It's the second segment, not the tail. So if I move left to (5,5), head would touch a body segment that is not the tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) – but x=7 is wall, so collision with wall.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), with current direction R, possible moves are U, D, or L, but L to (5,5) is body collision, so only U and D are safe.\n> \n> U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is R, so opposite is L. But since L is not possible due to body, it's not an option anyway.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (6,2). It's below, at same x.\n> \n> If I move down, to (6,4), then I'm closer to (6,2). From (6,4), I could move down again to (6,3), then to (6,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> But let's check if that's possible and safe.\n> \n> First, food at (6,2) has life span 9, so it will last until turn 60 (since turn 51 current, decreases each turn, so at turn 51, life span 9, turn 52:8, ..., turn 60:0, so disappears after turn 60, meaning it can be eaten from turn 51 to 60? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 51, life span is 9, meaning it has 9 turns left including this one? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life_span N, it appears and countdown starts at N, decreases each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? The phrasing: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn it spawns, countdown is N, then each turn it decreases, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it can be eaten only on that turn, then disappears.\n> \n> Here, life_span=9 on turn 51, so countdown=9 on turn 51, after turn 51, countdown=8 for turn 52, ..., after turn 59, countdown=0 for turn 60? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: at turn t, if food has life_span L, it means it will disappear after L more turns. So on turn t, L is the remaining life.\n> \n> After turn t, L decreases by 1, so on turn t+1, L = L-1, and so on, until L=0, then after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten as long as L >0.\n> \n> On turn t, if head moves to food cell, and L >0, it is eaten.\n> \n> Then, after eating, L becomes irrelevant for that food.\n> \n> In this case, turn 51, food at (6,2) with life_span=9, so it can be eaten from turn 51 to 59, I think? Let's count:\n> \n> Turn 51: life_span=9, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn 51, life_span decreases to 8 for turn 52.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 59, life_span=0 for turn 60, but on turn 60, if head moves there, life_span=0, so it cannot be eaten? Or does it disappear after the turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that when life_span reaches 0, it disappears, so it can only be eaten when life_span >=1.\n> \n> On turn t, with life_span L, if L >=1, it can be eaten that turn.\n> \n> After eating, it's gone.\n> \n> If not eaten, at the end of turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> When L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> For this food, L=9 on turn 51, so it can be eaten on turns 51 to 59 (since on turn 59, L=1, can be eaten; after that, L=0 on turn 60, gone).\n> \n> Turn 51: L=9\n> \n> Turn 52: L=8\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 59: L=1\n> \n> Turn 60: L=0, disappeared, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> So we have from turn 51 to 59 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From head (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go D to (6,4), then I'm at (6,4) on turn 52.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go D again to (6,3), then to (6,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> But need to check if (6,3) and (6,2) are safe.\n> \n> First, (6,3): not wall? x=6, y=3, not border wall, not (5,2) internal, so free. Is it occupied? Snake positions: no (6,3), so free.\n> \n> (6,2): food is there, but we need to move head to it to eat.\n> \n> But (6,2) is not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,2) is body, but (6,2) is different, so no body there, just food.\n> \n> Also, walls: (6,2) is not wall.\n> \n> So moving to (6,2) should be possible to eat food.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> In this case, food is at (6,2), which is not under snake body currently? Snake body has (3,2), but that's different cell. (6,2) is free, no body, so it can be eaten directly when head moves there.\n> \n> No issue.\n> \n> However, after eating, the snake grows, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Currently, snake is 13 segments. After eating positive food, it becomes 14.\n> \n> But we need to think about the path.\n> \n> Also, there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (2,3), and food is at (6,2), not near tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, if I go down directly: on turn 51, move D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then turn 52, move D to (6,3).\n> \n> Turn 53, move D to (6,2), eat food. Gain +1, length now 14.\n> \n> But is this safe? On each move, need to ensure no collision.\n> \n> Turn 51: from (6,5) to (6,4). After move, head at (6,4), body follows: the tail will move, but since we ate no food, tail moves away.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), the new positions: head (6,4), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, so snake becomes [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ..., (2,3)] but (2,3) is tail, which moves off? When snake moves without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current positions before move: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n> \n> After move down to (6,4): head moves to (6,4), then the body: the segment at (5,5) moves to (6,5), but (6,5) was head, now it's the second segment. Similarly, (4,5) moves to (5,5), and so on, down to the tail: (2,3) is removed, and the new tail is (2,2) or something? Let's trace.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4):\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then the body segments shift: the previous first body segment (5,5) becomes the new position where head was, but since head moved, the body follows.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (6,4)\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - Segment that was at index 1 (5,5) moves to where head was, (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment that was at index 2 (4,5) moves to (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment at index 3 (3,5) moves to (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment at index 4 (3,4) moves to (3,5)?

It's turn 52, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and an obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,4), and the body segments follow: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). That's 13 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2) is the tail, I think. Positions are given from head to tail, so index 0 is head, index 12 is tail. There are 13 positions, so length 13.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, which is down. But down means decreasing y, since y=0 is the bottom? In coordinates, usually y increases up, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y decreases when moving down. So (6,4) with direction D means it moved down to (6,4), so previous position was above, which is (6,5) since the next segment is (6,5). Snake positions: [(6,4), (6,5), ...] so head at (6,4), and the segment behind is (6,5), so yes, it was moving down to (6,4) from (6,5).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> (6,5) is a food position, but (6,5) is also occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, it's the second segment.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) is on a body segment. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, there's a warning about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,2), I think. Snake positions: last one is (2,2), so tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Head is at (6,4), tail at (2,2), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1. (6,4) and (2,2) are far, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, etc., at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (6,4) with direction D.\n> \n> Since direction is D (down), I cannot move U (up) instantly, because that would be reverse. So possible moves: L (left), R (right), or D (down again).\n> \n> - U: up, to (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by the snake body, and it's not the tail? Let's see.\n> \n> (6,5) is the second segment. If I move up to (6,5), that would be a collision with body, since (6,5) is a body segment and it's not the tail. The tail is at (2,2), so (6,5) is fixed body, not moving away immediately.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because tail moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for (6,5), it's not the tail, it's a body segment, so moving to (6,5) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,4), moving U to (6,5) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Now, moving D: down to (6,3). Is (6,3) free? Let's see what's at (6,3).\n> \n> First, snake positions: all listed, (6,3) is not in the list, so not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Walls: borders, x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,3) is within bounds, y=3 >0, and no internal obstacle at (6,3), obstacle is at (5,2), so (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> Food: (6,2) is food, but (6,3) is not food, I think.\n> \n> Moving L: left to (5,4). (5,4) is not in snake positions, and not wall, obstacle at (5,2), so (5,4) should be free.\n> \n> Moving R: right to (7,4). x=7 is border wall, so moving to (7,4) would hit wall, since x=7 is wall. Walls include x=7, so (7,4) is wall, collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,4): D to (6,3) or L to (5,4). R is wall, U is body collision.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): at (6,2), life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> Food at (6,5): at (6,5), life span 10, value +1, but currently under snake body.\n> \n> Since (6,5) is occupied, I can't eat it now. I need to move away so that the body moves, and later head can come back.\n> \n> But life span is 10 turns, so it might disappear by turn 52+10=62, but we're at turn 52, so it has 10 turns left, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 52, life span 10, it will disappear after 10 turns, so on turn 63 it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 on this turn, and after L turns, it disappears. So for (6,5), life_span=10 at turn 52, so on turn 53, it becomes 9, and so on, until turn 62 it has 0, so it disappears before turn 63? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 52, it has life_span 10, meaning it will be present for 10 more turns, from turn 52 to 61, and disappear on turn 62? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if life_span is L at turn t, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn t+L or on turn t+L?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" suggests that on turn t, with life_span L, it is present, and at the end of turn t, countdown decreases to L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,5) with life_span 10 at turn 52, it will be present until the end of turn 61 (since after 10 decreases, it reaches 0), so it disappears before turn 62. Similarly, (6,2) with life_span 8 at turn 52, disappears before turn 60.\n> \n> But for planning, we care about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, the food at (6,2) is at (6,2), which is below current position.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> If I go D to (6,3), then next position head at (6,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (6,2), which has food, or other directions.\n> \n> (6,2) has food, positive, value 1.\n> \n> If I go to (6,2), I eat it, snake length increases by 1, so new tail added.\n> \n> But let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (2,2), which is far.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,4), then head at (5,4), direction L (since I moved left).\n> \n> Then from (5,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction L, so cannot move R (right) instantly, because reverse.\n> \n> Possible: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or R, but R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ... so (5,5) is the third segment? Positions: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), etc.\n> \n> So (5,5) is occupied by body segment, not tail. Tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) from (5,4) would be body collision, since (5,5) is not tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) might be free, (4,4) might be free.\n> \n> (5,3): not in snake positions, not wall, obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> (4,4): not in positions, not wall.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (6,5) is under body, but if I move, the body might move away.\n> \n> Currently, if I move from (6,4), the snake will move: head to new position, body follows.\n> \n> For example, if I move D to (6,3), then new head at (6,3), and the tail will move, so the segment that was at (6,5) might move to (6,4), etc.\n> \n> Let's simulate the movement.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head at index 0: (6,4)\n> \n> After moving to a new cell, the head moves there, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added.\n> \n> But only if I eat food.\n> \n> First, for turn 52 action.\n> \n> I need to think about getting the food at (6,2) or planning for (6,5).\n> \n> (6,2) is below, life span 8, so I have time, but let's see the grid.\n> \n> Also, there's an obstacle at (5,2), which might block paths.\n> \n> I should map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (6,4)\n> \n> Body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> So occupied: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (6,3), (5,4), (5,3), (4,4), etc., but need to check.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (6,5) but (6,5) occupied.\n> \n> (6,5) has food under it, so when the snake moves away, it might be accessible.\n> \n> Life span: (6,2) has life 8, (6,5) has life 10, so both have several turns.\n> \n> But (6,2) is closer and can be eaten soon if I go down.\n> \n> If I go to (6,3) on turn 52, then on turn 53 I can go to (6,2) and eat it.\n> \n> But is (6,2) safe?

It's turn 53. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but since walls occupy those cells, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacle at (5,2) means that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), and body segments follow: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). Let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n> \n> That's 13 segments. So the snake is 13 cells long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which means it was moving left to (5,4) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous move was left, so from (6,4) to (5,4), direction L.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 9, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value 1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 53.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, I cannot move right immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (5,4) are U, D, L. But L is left, which is the current direction, so it's allowed, just not opposite.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (5,5)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (5,3)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (4,4)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (6,4) but R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.

(4,4) x=4,y=4.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is not any of these, so all three are potentially free.\n> \n> But I need to see if they are occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (5,5) is occupied by snake body (it's the fourth segment)\n> \n> - (4,4) is not in the list, so free?

The countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn 53, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 53 + 6 = 59? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, then after turn t, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears before the next turn? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for food at (6,2), turn 53, life span 7. After turn 53, life span becomes 6. After turn 54, 5, and so on, until after turn 59, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 60? Or after N turns means it is present for N turns including the current one?\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, L=1: present only at turn t, disappears after turn t (before turn t+1).\n> \n> L=2: present at turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, here (6,2) life span 7 at turn 53: present from turn 53 to 53+6=59? Turns: turn 53 (L=7), turn 54 (L=6), ..., turn 59 (L=1), turn 60 (L=0, disappears). So last chance to eat is on turn 59, when L=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 9 at turn 53: present until turn 53+8=61? Turn 53 (L=9), turn 54 (L=8), ..., turn 61 (L=1), turn 62 (L=0, disappears).

Let's see.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists until turn t + N - 1?

Turn 54: 8, turn 55:7, ..., turn 61:1, turn 62:0, gone? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t with life span N, after k turns, life span is N-k.\n> \n> It disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> So for (6,2): life span 6 at turn 54. After turn 54, it will have life span 5 for turn 55, etc. It is present from turn 54 to turn 59 (since at turn 59, life span 1, still there; after turn 59, at turn 60, life span 0, gone).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): life span 8 at turn 54, present from turn 54 to turn 61.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3).

To eat it, the body must move away first, then head can move there.\n> \n> Similarly, other positions.\n> \n> Now, let's think about options.\n> \n> From (4,3), I can go U to (4,4) or D to (4,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (4,4), then head at (4,4), and I can consider next moves.\n> \n> (4,4) is surrounded? Possible moves from (4,4): U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> But (4,5) is occupied by snake? In new positions after move: after moving to (4,4), the body includes (4,3) at position 1, and (4,5) was old seg6, but after move, (4,5) is now occupied by segment 7? Let's see new positions after moving U:\n> \n> Head at (4,4)\n> \n> Seg1: (4,3)  // old head\n> \n> Seg2: (5,3)  // old seg1\n> \n> Seg3: (5,4)  // old seg2\n> \n> Seg4: (6,4)  // old seg3\n> \n> Seg5: (6,5)  // old seg4\n> \n> Seg6: (5,5)  // old seg5\n> \n> Seg7: (4,5)  // old seg6\n> \n> Seg8: (3,5)  // old seg7\n> \n> Seg9: (3,4)  // old seg8\n> \n> Seg10: (3,3)  // old seg9\n> \n> Seg11: (3,2)  // old seg10\n> \n> Seg12: (3,1)  // old seg11, tail\n> \n> So occupied cells: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n> \n> From head (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied by seg7, which is not tail, so collision.\n> \n> D to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by seg1, which is not tail, collision.\n> \n> L to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by seg9, not tail, collision.\n> \n> R to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by seg3, not tail, collision.\n> \n> All adjacent cells are occupied except possibly walls, but (4,4) is inside, so all moves lead to body collision? That can't be right.\n> \n> (4,4) has neighbors: (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4)\n> \n> All of these are occupied in the new snake positions, as above.\n> \n> (4,5) is seg7, (4,3) is seg1, (3,4) is seg9, (5,4) is seg3, all body segments, not tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1), far away.\n> \n> So from (4,4), I have no safe move? That means moving to (4,4) traps me, I die on the next turn because I can't move anywhere.\n> \n> But that can't be, let's double-check the positions.\n> \n> After moving to (4,4), the snake occupies:\n> \n> - (4,4) head\n> \n> - (4,3) seg1\n> \n> - (5,3) seg2\n> \n> - (5,4) seg3\n> \n> - (6,4) seg4\n> \n> - (6,5) seg5\n> \n> - (5,5) seg6\n> \n> - (4,5) seg7\n> \n> - (3,5) seg8\n> \n> - (3,4) seg9\n> \n> - (3,3) seg10\n> \n> - (3,2) seg11\n> \n> - (3,1) seg12 tail\n> \n> Now, cells around (4,4):\n> \n> North: (4,5) - occupied by seg7\n> \n> South: (4,3) - occupied by seg1\n> \n> West: (3,4) - occupied by seg9\n> \n> East: (5,4) - occupied by seg3\n> \n> All occupied, no free cell. And since none are the tail (tail is at (3,1)), moving to any would collide. So indeed, moving up to (4,4) is suicidal because next turn I have no move.\n> \n> Therefore, moving U from (4,3) is very bad.\n> \n> Now, the only other option is D to (4,2).\n> \n> Move down to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is free, no food there.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,2)\n> \n> Then body: seg1 at old head (4,3)\n> \n> Seg2 at old seg1 (5,3)\n> \n> Seg3 at old seg2 (5,4)\n> \n> Seg4 at old seg3 (6,4)\n> \n> Seg5 at old seg4 (6,5)\n> \n> Seg6 at old seg5 (5,5)\n> \n> Seg7 at old seg6 (4,5)\n> \n> Seg8 at old seg7 (3,5)\n> \n> Seg9 at old seg8 (3,4)\n> \n> Seg10 at old seg9 (3,3)\n> \n> Seg11 at old seg10 (3,2)\n> \n> Seg12 at old seg11 (3,1) tail\n> \n> Old seg11 was (3,1), so new tail at (3,1)?

But seg1 is the first body segment, right behind head.\n> \n> When I move, if I go back to (4,3), which is now seg1, but since the snake moves, when I move head to (4,3), seg1 will move to somewhere else, but at the moment of move, (4,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Rule: collision if head touches any body segment except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (4,3) is seg1, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> D to (4,1) - (4,1): y=1, not border wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall. But (4,1) is not occupied? Snake has seg12 at (3,1), not (4,1). So (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> L to (3,2) - (3,2) is occupied by seg11, not tail.\n> \n> R to (5,2) - (5,2) is the internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, current head direction: after moving down, the new head direction is D.\n> \n> But for next move, I need to see possible actions.\n> \n> So from (4,2):\n> \n> - U to (4,3): occupied by seg1, collision\n> \n> - D to (4,1): free? Let's check if wall or occupied. (4,1): x=4,y=1, not border (borders x=0,7 y=0,7), not internal obstacle (5,2), not in snake positions above, so free.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): occupied by seg11, collision\n> \n> - R to (5,2): wall, cannot move\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (4,1).\n> \n> Then after that, I can go down again or left/right, but let's see.\n> \n> First, at turn 55, from (4,3), moving D to (4,2) seems necessary because U is suicide.\n> \n> Then at turn 56, from (4,2), only move is D to (4,1).\n> \n> Then head at (4,1).\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,1), snake positions: head (4,1), seg1 at (4,2), seg2 at (4,3), seg3 at (5,3), and so on, tail at (3,1)? Let's trace.\n> \n> After turn 55 move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (5,3), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (3,5), seg9 (3,4), seg10 (3,3), seg11 (3,2), seg12 (3,1)\n> \n> At turn 56, move D to (4,1). No food at (4,1), so snake moves, head to (4,1), then seg1 to old head (4,2), seg2 to old seg1 (4,3), seg3 to old seg2 (5,3), ..., seg12 to old seg11 (3,2), and old tail (3,1) gone.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (3,4), seg11 (3,3), seg12 (3,2) tail.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (4,2): occupied by seg1, collision\n> \n> D to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, cannot move\n> \n> L to (3,1): (3,1) is not occupied now? In new positions, tail is at (3,2), (3,1) is free? (3,1) was old tail but gone, and not in new positions.

It's turn 56. The grid has walls: border cells meaning x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), and it's moving down (D). The body segments are listed: from head to tail: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value is +1 for all, and they increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is down, so from (4,2), moving down would be to (4,1), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down to (4,1) would hit the wall? Let's check coordinates.\n> \n> Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply increasing y is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so y increases up, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,2), direction down. Down is (x,y-1), so from (4,2) down to (4,1). But y=1 is within bounds? y=0 is wall, so (4,1) should be free, since walls are at exact x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (4,1) is not a wall, it's inside. y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row above bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacle at (5,2), which is occupied by wall? No, it says cells occupied by walls: border and internal obstacles given as (5,2).\n> \n> So (5,2) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,2), (6,5), (1,3)\n> \n> Life span: (6,2) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 56, life=4, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So if current turn is t, and life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases each turn, starting at L, after one turn it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (6,2), life=4 at turn 56, so it will be there until turn 59 (56+3), and disappear at turn 60? Let's see:\n> \n> - Turn 56: life=4\n> \n> - After turn 56, countdown to 3? The countdown decreases after the turn, I think. The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> It says \"including current\", which might mean that at the start of turn, the countdown is decreased.\n> \n> But for food, when is it eaten? When the head moves onto it during the turn.\n> \n> Perhaps: at the beginning of turn, before action, the life span is checked and decreased.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that for food with life span N at turn t, it has N turns left including the current one. So if not eaten, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present for N more turns.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" — after N turns from now.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, with life span L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But when does it disappear? After the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For example: at turn t, life span N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+N-1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears, so it is not present at turn t+N.\n> \n> It is present from turn t to turn t+N-1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (6,2) at turn 56, life=4, so present from turn 56 to 59 (4 turns: 56,57,58,59), disappear at turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life=6, present turns 56 to 61.\n> \n> (1,3) life=9, present turns 56 to 64.\n> \n> All good.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction down.

But is it a wall? No, walls are only borders and (5,2). (5,2) is wall, but (4,1) is not mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> Down to (4,1) seems possible.\n> \n> Left (L): to (3,2). (3,2) is occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: (3,2) is part of the body, it's the 12th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,3), 11: (3,2), 12: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied, so moving left to (3,2) would collide with body, but it's not the tail? Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, the tail moves, so it might be ok if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> (3,2) is not the tail; tail is at (3,1). (3,2) is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): to (5,2). But (5,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,2) is a wall, as given.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,1): free, no body, not wall.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,2): but (3,2) is occupied by body (segment at index 11), and it's not the tail, so collision. Not safe.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,2): wall, collision.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (4,3): but current direction is D, moving U is reverse, not allowed. Also, (4,3) is occupied by body segment index 1, so definitely collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (4,1). Is that right?\n> \n> But food is at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3), none at (4,1).\n> \n> But (4,1) is safe to move to.\n> \n> In terms of action, for turn 56, I must move, and only D is possible? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move to other cells, but based on above, only D is safe.\n> \n> But (4,1) is free, yes.\n> \n> After moving, the snake will move: head to (4,1), then the body follows, so tail moves from (3,1) to whatever, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, for future turns, I need to think ahead to maximize score, avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's plan the action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, as per instruction.\n> \n> Current turn 56, head at (4,2), move to (4,1).\n> \n> Then turn 57: head at (4,1), direction was down, but after moving, new direction is down?

Specifically, in the positions after turn 56, (6,5) is occupied by a body segment, so the food is under the body. It can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 57, (6,5) is still occupied?

The last segment moves to old position of the previous last, which was (3,3)? Positions: after move, new body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> Head (5,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail at (3,3)\n> \n> Now turn 58: head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: right to (6,1), or up to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, cannot; down to (5,0) wall; left to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body (first segment), so collision if move there. Only possible move is right to (6,1).\n> \n> Move to (6,1). New head (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Then body shifts: head to (6,1), body segments move: segment at (4,1) moves to (5,1) old head?

New positions: head (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> Now turn 59: head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: up to (6,2), down to (6,0) wall, left to (5,1), or right to (7,1) x=7 wall.\n> \n> (5,1) is occupied by body segment (first body cell), so cannot move left, collision.\n> \n> Down to (6,0) wall.\n> \n> Right to (7,1) wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is up to (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) has food, and it is free? Currently, after turn 58, positions are (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), etc., (6,2) not occupied, so yes, move to (6,2) and eat food.\n> \n> Then snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But we need to check for tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, but here, when eating, head moves to (6,2), which has food, so eat it, then the new tail is added, but the position (6,2) was food, now head is there, and after eating, the tail doesn't grow immediately? When you eat food, the length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length of snake +1, so when head moves to food, it eats, and the body doesn't move the tail, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning the tail stays in place, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. The new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the position before the move is fixed.\n> \n> After move to food, the head is at new position, and all segments shift, but since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the last position is not vacated; instead, a new segment is added there.\n> \n> For collision: after eating, the head is at food position, and the body includes the previous positions, but since tail didn't move, the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added? I need to clarify.\n> \n> From the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And movement: when moving to a cell without food, head moves, tail moves, length same.\n> \n> When moving to food, head moves to food, eats it, and tail does not move, so length increases by one; the new head position is set, and the body segments shift as usual, but the tail position stays, so the segment that was second last becomes the new last, but since tail doesn't move, the tail segment remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose head at A, tail at Z. Move to food at B: head moves to B, eats food, so new head at B. Then the body: the segment behind head moves to A, and so on, down to the tail segment, which would normally move to Y, but since food eaten, the tail does not move, so it stays at Z, and a new segment is effectively added at Z, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after eating: head at B, first body segment at A (previous head), second at previous first body, ..., the tail segment remains at Z, so Z is still occupied, and the new tail is at Z.\n> \n> The length increases, so there is one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), when head moves there, it eats, so snake grows, tail stays.\n> \n> Now, for tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Here, when eating at (6,2), the tail is at (3,4) currently? After turn 58 positions, tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Head at (6,1), tail at (3,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, like (x±1,y) or (x,y±1).\n> \n> (6,1) and (3,4) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), head at (6,2), tail at (3,4), still not adjacent.\n> \n> So no danger.\n> \n> Thus, eating (6,2) is safe and good.\n> \n> Now, alternative: if on turn 57 I go left to (3,1) instead.\n> \n> From (4,1), move L to (3,1).\n> \n> Then turn 57: head to (3,1), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Then positions: head (3,1), body: segment at (4,1) moves to (4,1)? Head was (4,1) to (3,1), so body shifts:\n> \n> - Was at (4,2) moves to (4,1)\n> \n> - Was at (4,3) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> - Was at (5,3) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Was at (5,4) moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - Etc., similar to before.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), possible moves: left to (2,1), or up to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? After this move, positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) — tail at (3,3) or something.\n> \n> (3,2) might be free or not. Let's not go this way, because it might lead away from food.\n> \n> The food (6,2) is time-sensitive, life=3 at turn 57, so we need to reach it soon.\n> \n> If I go left to (3,1), it might take more turns to reach (6,2), and it could disappear.\n> \n> For example, from (3,1), I can go up to (3,2) or left to (2,1), etc., but to reach (6,2), I need to go through (4,2), (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so I have to go down or around, which takes longer.\n> \n> For instance, from (3,1) to (3,2) if possible, but (3,2) after turn 57 might be occupied.\n> \n> After turn 57 move to (3,1): head (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc., so (3,2) is not in positions, should be free?

No: the tail segment was at (3,4), but it moves to (3,5) as above? When food eaten, the tail does not move, meaning the last segment does not advance, so the position is not vacated; instead, a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> In the shifting, the body segments all move except the tail.\n> \n> Standard: when no food, all segments move: head to new, each body to previous position.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to new, each body segment moves to its previous position, but the tail segment does not move; it stays, and since all segments shift, it means that the segment that was second last becomes the new last, but because tail doesn't move, the tail position remains occupied, and the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> After the move, the head is at the new position, and the body includes all previous positions plus the old tail position is still there.\n> \n> For example: positions before move: head, body1, body2, ..., tail\n> \n> Move to food: new head at food, body1 moves to old head, body2 moves to old body1, ..., the segment that was tail stays at tail position, so now the body has the old body1 to old tail, and a new segment at old tail? No.\n> \n> After move: new head at food, then body segments: first body segment at old head, second at old first body, ..., the last body segment at old second last body, and the tail remains at old tail position.

According to the rule, for food under the snake, it can only be eaten when the snake moves away and then back. But if the head is on it, and it's food, should it be eaten immediately? The rule says \"the head moves onto the food cell\", which might imply that when the head enters the cell, it eats it.\n> \n> But in this case, at the start of turn 58, head is at (3,1) with food.

But that seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps \"under the snake's body\" includes the head, or excludes it.\n> \n> I think \"body\" might refer to segments other than head. In snake terminology, \"body\" often includes all parts except head, or sometimes head is separate.\n> \n> Let's see the rule: \"the body moves away\" and \"the head moves onto\".\n> \n> So for a cell occupied by a body segment, not head, food can be there, and to eat it, the body must move away (so the cell is free), then head moves to it.\n> \n> For the head cell, if food is there when head is on it, it should be eaten immediately, I assume.\n> \n> But in this state, at turn 58, food at (3,1) is listed, and head is at (3,1).

Perhaps at the start of the turn, if food is under head, it is not automatically eaten; it only gets eaten when the head enters the cell, which requires moving away and back.\n> \n> That might be the case from the rule.\n> \n> To simplify, for this situation, since head is on (3,1) with food, if the snake moves to a different direction, the head leaves (3,1), and the food is still there, then later if it comes back, it can eat it.\n> \n> But for this turn, since it's already on it, no eating happens this turn.\n> \n> Similarly for other body parts.\n> \n> In the food list, (3,1) is listed, so it's present.\n> \n> Also, other food: (6,2) life 2, (6,5) life 4, (1,3) life 7, all value +1.\n> \n> Now, life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 58, for (6,2) life 2, it will disappear after 2 turns, meaning at turn 60 it will be gone, so it has turns 58 and 59 to be eaten? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Or after t + L?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, at the end of turn t, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life span 2 at turn 58:\n> \n> - At turn 58: countdown 2\n> \n> - After turn 58, countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 59, countdown 0, disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 58 or 59.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life 4: can be eaten turns 58,59,60,61\n> \n> (1,3) life 7: turns 58 to 64\n> \n> (3,1) life 10: turns 58 to 67\n> \n> But (3,1) is under head, so not immediately eatable.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), direction L, so it came from the right, probably from (4,1) at previous turn.\n> \n> Previous turn, head was at (4,1), moved left to (3,1), so direction is L.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is L, it can move U, D, L.

After the move, segment 1 moves to the new position, but since head is moving to (4,1), and segment 1 was there, it will move to the next position.\n> \n> Sequence: when snake moves, head goes to new cell.

To free it, the snake needs to move so that the segment at (6,5) moves away.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 59, I move U to (2,2), then seg9 is at (6,5).\n> \n> On turn 60, if I move, say, R to (3,2), then new positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) - seg9 is still at (6,5)? After move to (3,2), new seg9 is at old seg8 position (6,4), new seg10 at old seg9 position (6,5), so (6,5) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment at (6,5) will only move when the snake moves forward, but it's not the tail, so it moves when the head moves.\n> \n> The cell (6,5) will be free when the segment that was there moves to a new position, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the tail.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (6,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> So when the snake moves, the segment at (6,5) will move to where the previous segment was, but only if it's not the last.\n> \n> After each move, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it, so the position it was on is vacated only if it was the tail, but for non-tail, the position is occupied by the next segment moving in.\n> \n> For a body segment to vacate its cell, it must be that the snake moves in a way that that segment is the one that moves to a different cell, but since the segments are connected, when the head moves, all segments shift, so each cell that was occupied by a body segment is now occupied by the next segment, except the tail cell which is vacated.\n> \n> For example, in a line, if snake is A-B-C, head A. After move, new head D, then positions D-A-B, and C is vacated. So cell that was C is free, cell that was B is now occupied by C? No.\n> \n> Positions: before move: cell1: A (head), cell2: B, cell3: C (tail)\n> \n> After move to new head position D: new head D, new body1: A (previous head), new body2: B (previous body1), and cell C is vacated.\n> \n> So only the tail cell is vacated. Other body cells are still occupied, but by different segments.\n> \n> To have a body cell free, it must be that the segment that was there moves away and no other segment moves in, but in a connected snake, when a segment moves, another segment moves into its place, so the only cell that becomes free is the tail position after it moves.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten when that body segment moves away and the head moves in at the same time, but since the segment moves away when the snake moves, and head moves to a new cell, for head to move to a cell that was just vacated, it must be adjacent to the head or something.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> This must happen on the same turn: when the body moves away from the food cell, and on that same turn, the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Because if the body moves away, the cell is free, then head can move to it later, but the rule says \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell\" implying simultaneously or on the same turn.\n> \n> Let me read: \"1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn when the head moves to the food cell, the body that was there must have just moved away.\n> \n> In other words, for a food under a body segment, it can only be eaten when that segment is the tail, and the tail moves away, and head moves to that cell in the same turn.\n> \n> Because if it's not the tail, when it moves away, another segment moves in, so the cell is not free for the head to move in.\n> \n> Only when the segment is the tail, and it moves away, the cell is vacated, and if the head moves to that cell on the same turn, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in that case, it might be dangerous because of tail reward danger.\n> \n> Let's see the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if it's the tail cell and head moves to it after tail moves away.\n> \n> But in that case, when head moves to the tail cell, the tail has moved, so the cell is free, head moves there, and since it's food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't grow immediately, but after eating, the tail stays where it was, I think.\n> \n> Snake growth: when snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, for food under body, if it's the tail cell, and tail moves away, cell free, head moves to it, eats food, then snake grows, so the new tail is the old tail position, which is where the tail moved to, but since tail moved, it's not there anymore.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at position T, with food.\n> \n> On a turn, snake moves: tail moves to a new position, say T', vacating T.\n> \n> If head moves to T on the same turn, then head is at T, which has food, so it eats it, and since it eats, the tail does not move, so the segment that was at T' (which was the new tail position) stays, and a new segment is added at head or something.\n> \n> Standard mechanics: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake at positions, including tail at T.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, say N.\n> \n> If N is food, then head at N, body segments move to previous positions, but the tail stays in place, so the new tail is the old second last segment or something.\n> \n> Example: snake positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to N.\n> \n> If N is not food, then new head N, new body1 H, new body2 B1, ..., new tail Bk, and T vacated.\n> \n> If N is food, then new head N, new body1 H, new body2 B1, ..., new bodyk Bk, and T stays as tail, so new tail T, and no vacated cell, snake length increases.\n> \n> For food under body: if the food is under a body segment that is not the tail, it can never be eaten because when that segment moves, another segment moves into its place, so the cell is never free for the head to move in.\n> \n> Only if the food is under the tail, then when the tail moves, the cell is vacated, and if head moves to that cell on the same turn, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in that case, for head to move to the tail cell, the head must be adjacent to the tail, and moving to the tail position.\n> \n> But the \"Tail Reward Danger\" says that if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Specifically: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When head moves to the tail cell, it is adjacent before the move, and after move, head is at tail position, and since it eats, tail does not move, so the new tail is the old tail position, but head is there, so they collide.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So for food under the tail, it is dangerous to eat if head is adjacent.\n> \n> If the food is under a non-tail body segment, it cannot be eaten at all, because the cell is never free.\n> \n> In this state, food at (3,1) is under a body segment, not tail, so it cannot be eaten unless that segment becomes the tail later.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,5), it is under a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> So for those foods, we need to wait until they are no longer under the body or until the segment is the tail.\n> \n> But they have life span, so might disappear before that.\n> \n> For example, (3,1) food life span 9, it might become accessible later.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,5), life span 3.\n> \n> But for now, the only immediately eatable food is (1,3), which is free.\n> \n> And (6,2) but it will disappear.\n> \n> So for turn 59, I should move towards (1,3) or other.\n> \n> But let's choose the action.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (2,2) on turn 59.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (1,3) via (2,3) or directly if possible.\n> \n> From (2,2), to (1,3) is not adjacent, need to go to (1,2) or (2,3) first.\n> \n> (1,2) is free, (2,3) is free.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3) on turn 60, then L to (1,3) on turn 61 to eat.\n> \n> Or from (2,2) go L to (1,2) on turn 60, then U to (1,3) on turn 61.\n> \n> Same.\n> \n> But going to (2,3) might be better for exploring.\n> \n> Also, I can consider the food at (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is occupied, life span 3, so to eat it, it must become the tail or be free, but since it's not tail, it won't be free unless the snake moves in a way that it becomes the tail soon.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,4), and the snake is coiled, so it might take time for (6,5) to become tail.\n> \n> For example, the distance from head to tail in terms of segments.\n> \n> Head to tail is 12 segments away, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach where (6,5) is.\n> \n> By that time, life span of (6,5) is 3, so it will disappear before.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1), life span 9, might be possible.\n> \n> But for now, focus on available food.\n> \n> Another food: (3,1) is on the body, but if I can make it the tail, but it will take time.\n> \n> Life span 9, so if I can survive, it might be eaten later.\n> \n> But for short term, (1,3) is the only option.\n> \n> Also, after eating (1,3), I can go to other places.\n> \n> Now, about the internal obstacle at (5,2), which is wall, so I need to avoid that.\n> \n> Back to turn 59 choice.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,1), then on turn 60 I must move U to (1,2), then on turn 61 U to (1,3) to eat food.\n> \n> Then snake grows, length 14.\n> \n> Then from (1,3), I can move to (1,4), (2,3), or (1,2) but (1,2) is body.\n> \n> After eating at (1,3), positions: head at (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc., and tail at (3,5) or where.\n> \n> But (3,1) has food under it, but not tail, so not eatable yet.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2) on turn 59, then on turn 60 I can go U to (2,3), then on turn 61 L to (1,3) to eat.\n> \n> Same as above.\n> \n> From (2,2), I could go R to (3,2) on turn 60, then to (3,3) or (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied.\n> \n> After turn 59 move U to (2,2), positions as before.\n> \n> (3,2) is free, so on turn 60 I can go R to (3,2).\n> \n> Then from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) occupied, L to (2,2) occupied, R to (4,2) occupied, so only U to (3,3) or possibly D but invalid, so only U to (3,3).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can go to (3,4) or (4,3) or (3,2) occupied, etc.\n> \n> But (3,4) is free now, since vacated earlier.\n> \n> In this path, I don't eat the food at (1,3) immediately, but I can later.\n> \n> But life span 6, so I have time.\n> \n> However, the food at (6,5) has only life span 3, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n> \n> But since it's under body, I can't eat it unless it becomes tail, which won't happen in 3 turns.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (3,5), and to move the tail to (6,5), it would take many moves, at least the number of segments, 13 moves, but since the snake moves, it might be less if I move towards it, but still, in 3 turns, impossible for tail to be at (6,5).\n> \n> The tail moves one step per turn, from (3,5), it can move to (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), etc., but (4,5) is occupied, so it will move to free cells.\n> \n> But currently, from (3,5), it can move to (3,4) if free, or (2,5), etc.\n> \n> But to reach (6,5), it's far, |6-3| + |5-5| =3, so at least 3 moves, but only if I move the snake in a way that the tail goes that way, but it's not direct.\n> \n> In 3 turns, tail can move at most 3 cells away, from (3,5) to say (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), not to (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is at (6,5), from (3,5) it's 3 right, so possible in 3 turns if the snake moves right, but the head is at (2,1), not moving right immediately.\n> \n> So likely, (6,5) food will not be eatable and will disappear after turn 61.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) food might become eatable later if it becomes tail.\n> \n> For now, best to go for the free food at (1,3).\n> \n> So for turn 59, moving U to (2,2) seems better than L to (1,1) because from (2,2) I have more options.\n> \n> For example, from (2,2), I can go to (2,3) or (3,2), whereas from (1,1), I'm cornered.\n> \n> Also, after eating (1,3), I can explore the top or right.\n> \n> Let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> Turn 59: move U to (2,2)  // from (2,1) to (2,2)\n> \n> New head direction U.\n> \n> Then turn 60: from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) to get closer to (1,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is free, as per earlier.\n> \n> Move U to (2,3)\n> \n> New head (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Then turn 61: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n> \n> Now, when I move to (1,3) on turn 61, it has food, so I eat it, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n> \n> Before turn 61, positions after turn 60: let's track.\n> \n> Turn 59: move U to (2,2)\n> \n> Positions after turn 59:\n> - Head: (2,2)\n> - Seg1: (2,1)  // previous head\n> - Seg2: (3,1)  // previous seg1\n> - Seg3: (4,1)\n> - Seg4: (4,2)\n> - Seg5: (4,3)\n> - Seg6: (5,3)\n> -

value 1.\n> \n> New head: (1,3)\n> Since ate food, snake grows, so new body: the tail does not move, so positions:\n> - Head: (1,3)\n> - Body1: (2,3)  // previous head\n> - Body2: (2,2)  // previous

previous tail, now body, tail is still at (4,5) since no move, but because of growth, the tail stays.\n> \n> When snake eats food, on the move, head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at head, but since head moved, it's a bit different.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to food cell, the head is there, then the body follows: the first body segment moves to previous head position, etc., and the tail does not move, so the snake length increases by one, with the tail staying.\n> \n> So in positions: new head at food cell, new body1 at old head position, new body2 at old body1 position, ..., new bodyk at old bodyk-1 position, and new tail at old tail position.\n> \n> In this case, after

It's turn 60, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But the snake positions start from (2,2), which should be within bounds. Let me list all wall cells:\n> \n> - Border: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7). But since y=0 and y=7 are walls, that covers the bottom and top rows.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (2,2), and direction is U (up). But in grid coordinates, what does U mean? Typically, in such games, increasing y might be up or down, but here it says U is (x,y+1), so I think y increases upwards. Let me confirm: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so moving up increases y. Similarly, D decreases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. So moving U from (2,2) would go to (2,3).\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Head at (2,2), tail at (3,5). Length is 13 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (2,2), so previous position must have been below, like (2,1), which is the second segment, so yes, it moved up to (2,2) from (2,1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 60, life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 62? Let's see: if countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life_span = N\n> \n> - After turn t, it becomes N-1\n> \n> - When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will be there for this turn, and after the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=1, after this turn it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it won't be there on the next turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is N at turn t, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, food at (6,5) with life_span 3 at turn 60:\n> \n> - Present on turn 60 (current), 61, 62.\n> \n> - Disappears after turn 62, so not on turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 5: present turns 60 to 64.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 8: present turns 60 to 67.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Turn 60 is current, so I need to plan actions for turn 60, 61, 62, etc., but the sequence should start from turn 60 action.\n> \n> Action sequence for the next few turns, but since I have to think ahead, I should simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, current head position: (2,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: current direction is U, so I cannot go D on next turn because D is opposite of U.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 60: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does.\n> \n> If I go U from (2,2) to (2,3).\n> \n> Is (2,3) safe? Let's check if it's a wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (2,3) is x=2,y=3, within 1-6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. (2,3) is fine.\n> \n> Body: snake positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> (2,3) is not in this list, so safe to move.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food. Otherwise, tail moves, so head moves to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,3) no food there, so tail (3,5) will be removed, head at (2,3), new body segments.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,5), (1,3), (3,1). None at (2,3), so no eat.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L: to (1,2)\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2, not wall, not in body?

Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (6,5) has both snake and food? But when can it be eaten? The food is there, but since snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves off and then head moves on.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,5), since it's occupied by body, the head cannot eat it directly. First, the snake must move so that this cell is vacated, then later head can move onto it to eat.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 60, (6,5) has food and snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,3) and (3,1), not under snake.\n> \n> (3,1) is also occupied?

So last move was to the left, to (1,2) from previous position.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food, no negative food here. Value 1 means +1 point and length increases by 1.\n> \n> Life span: (6,5) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including this turn. So if not eaten by turn 62, it's gone.\n> \n> (1,3) has life span 4, disappears after turn 64 if not eaten.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 7, disappears turn 67.\n> \n> (1,5) life span 10, disappears turn 70.\n> \n> Now, I need to move the snake. Current head position (1,2), direction L. Since head direction is L, I just moved left to (1,2). Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since I'm moving left, I cannot move right (opposite) on this next turn. So possible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left again), but not R.\n> \n> No instant reverse means I cannot move in the opposite direction of the current head direction on the very next turn. Current head direction is L, so I cannot move R. So allowed: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to understand where I can move.\n> \n> First, walls: borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake body: I need to avoid colliding with body except for the tail, but with caution because of tail reward danger.\n> \n> Current head at (1,2). Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,3) — is this available?\n> \n> (1,3) has food, but let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> - D: to (1,1) — but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is within bounds? Grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (1,1) is not a wall cell. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,1) is empty, I think, unless snake or obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (1,1) is not in snake positions, and no obstacle there, so it should be free.\n> \n> But y=0 is wall, so (1,0) is wall, but (1,1) is not wall, it's inside.\n> \n> Similarly, L: to (0,2) — x=0 is wall, so (0,2) is invalid, cannot move there.\n> \n> R: to (2,2) — but (2,2) is occupied by the first body segment. Moving to (2,2) would cause collision because head touches body, except if it's the tail and tail moves, but here (2,2) is not the tail; tail is at (4,5). Let's see the order.\n> \n> Head is at (1,2), next segment is (2,2), so if I move right to (2,2), that's where the body is, and since it's not the tail, it will still be there when head moves, so collision.\n> \n> Unless the tail is moving away, but in this case, moving to (2,2) would hit the body segment that is fixed until the tail moves.\n> \n> General rule: when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its position if no food eaten, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> But for body segments, they don't move immediately; only after head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it's collision because that segment is still there.\n> \n> Except if it's the tail cell, and tail is about to move, but only if no food is eaten. If you eat food, tail doesn't move, so head moving to tail position causes collision because tail stays.\n> \n> But in this case, for (2,2), it's not the tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> So moving to (2,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except possibly tail is dangerous.\n> \n> But tail: if I move to tail position, and I don't eat food, tail moves away, so it's safe. If I eat food, tail stays, and head collides.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (1,2):\n> \n> - U: to (1,3)\n> \n> - D: to (1,1)\n> \n> - L: to (0,2) — but x=0 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,2) — occupied by body, collision, invalid\n> \n> So only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> Cannot move L because wall, cannot move R because body collision.\n> \n> So only U or D.\n> \n> Now, U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n> \n> (1,3) has food! Food at (1,3) with value 1, life span 4.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,3), I eat the food there.\n> \n> But is it safe?\n> \n> First, let's think about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows, so head and new tail collide if they were adjacent.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,5), head is at (1,2), not adjacent. Distance: |dx|=3, |dy|=3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, like one cell away horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> (1,2) to (4,5) is not adjacent; they are several cells apart.\n> \n> So no issue with that for (1,3) food.\n> \n> Now, when I eat food at (1,3), snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), head is there, and since I ate food, the tail stays at (4,5), and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and since food is eaten, the tail does not move; so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (1,3), then the previous head (1,2) becomes the new segment 1, and so on, down to tail at (4,5) which now becomes segment 13, and since we ate, tail stays, so the segment count increases.\n> \n> Original snake: 13 segments.\n> \n> After eating, head moves to (1,3), so positions: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), ..., up to tail (4,5), but tail stays, so now 14 segments.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, segments: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n> \n> After moving U to (1,3) and eating food: new head at (1,3), then the rest: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), ..., (4,5) — and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so (4,5) is still there, now segment 14.\n> \n> So positions: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Now, is there any immediate collision? Head at (1,3), which was empty except for food, but food is eaten. Body segments are all behind, so no collision.\n> \n> Now, what about moving D to (1,1)? (1,1) is empty, no food, so no growth, tail moves away.\n> \n> But let's see the options.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their positions:\n> \n> - Food at (6,5): value 1, life span 2 — so must be eaten by turn 62 to get it, else gone. Turn 61 now, life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including current, so after turn 62, it's gone. So to eat, must be on turn 61 or 62.\n> \n> - Food at (1,3): value 1, life span 4 — disappears after turn 64, so can be eaten on 61,62,63,64.\n> \n> - Food at (3,1): value 1, life span 7 — disappears after turn 67.\n> \n> - Food at (1,5): value 1, life span 10 — disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,2), with only U and D possible.\n> \n> If I go U to (1,3), I eat the food there immediately, get +1, length 14.\n> \n> Then head at (1,3), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since I moved U, I cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> Now, from (1,3):\n> \n> - U: to (1,4)\n> \n> - D: to (1,2) — but (1,2) is now the second segment, since after moving to (1,3), (1,2) is occupied by segment 2. So moving to (1,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> - L: to (0,3) — x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) might be free? Let's see current positions after move.\n> \n> After eating at (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (2,3) is not occupied, and no wall, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) might be free.\n> \n> So from (1,3), after moving U, I can move U to (1,4), or R to (2,3), but not D (reverse and body), not L (wall).\n> \n> Now, if I go D from (1,2) to (1,1), no food eaten, so tail moves.\n> \n> Moving D to (1,1): head to (1,1), no food, so tail at (4,5) moves away? Tail movement: since no food eaten, the tail moves to the previous position of segment 12, which is (5,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions before any move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] tail is (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,1), no food, so new positions: head (1,1), then the body moves: segment 1 was (2,2) moves to previous head (1,2)? Standard: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it in the list.\n> \n> So new head: (1,1)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (was (2,2)) moves to where head was, (1,2)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was (2,1)) moves to where segment 1 was, (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 3 (was (3,1)) moves to where segment 2 was, (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 (was (4,1)) moves to where segment 3 was, (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 5 (was (4,2)) moves to where segment 4 was, (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 6 (was (4,3)) moves to where segment 5 was, (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 7 (was (5,3)) moves to where segment 6 was, (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 8 (was (5,4)) moves to where segment 7 was, (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 9 (was (6,4)) moves to where segment 8 was, (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 10 (was (6,5)) moves to where segment 9 was, (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 11 (was (5,5)) moves to where segment 10 was, (6,5)\n> \n> Segment 12 (tail was (4,5)) moves to where segment 11 was, (5,5)\n> \n> And (4,5) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5)\n> \n> Now head at (1,1), direction D (down).\n> \n> From here, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite of D).\n> \n> Can move D, L, R.\n> \n> - D: to (1,0) — but y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (0,1) — x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,1) — (2,1) is occupied by segment 3 in new positions? Positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), ... so (2,1) is segment 4? List: index 0: (1,1) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1), etc.\n> \n> (2,1) is position of segment 3, which is body, so moving to (2,1) would collide.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,1) after moving D, only possible move is R to (2,1)? But (2,1) is occupied, collision.\n> \n> (2,1) is the position of segment 3, so yes, occupied.\n> \n> Are there other moves? D and L invalid, R to (2,1) occupied.\n> \n> U is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> But (1,1) has no other adjacent cells except (0,1) wall, (1,0) wall, (2,1) occupied, (1,2) is segment 1, occupied.\n> \n> (1,2) is adjacent up, but occupied by segment 1.\n> \n> So indeed, after moving to (1,1), I have no valid moves except possibly into the tail, but tail is at (5,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> From (1,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,2) — occupied by segment 1\n> \n> - Down: (1,0) — wall\n> \n> - Left: (0,1) — wall\n> \n> - Right: (2,1) — occupied by segment 3\n> \n> All are blocked or occupied, so no valid moves! If I go to (1,1), I die immediately on the next turn because no place to go.\n> \n> Therefore, moving D to (1,1) is suicidal; I must not do that.\n> \n> So the only sensible move is U to (1,3) to eat the food and avoid death.\n> \n> But let's confirm: from (1,2), if I move D to (1,1), then as above, in the next turn, no possible moves, so I collide or something.\n> \n> In the state after moving to (1,1), head is at (1,1), and for next move, I need to choose a direction, but all adjacent cells are either wall or body, so wherever I move, I hit wall or body, so death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving down is not an option; I have to move up to (1,3).\n> \n> Moreover, by moving up, I eat the food at (1,3), which is good.\n> \n> Now, after that, I need to plan ahead.\n> \n> So action for turn 61: U (to (1,3))\n> \n> Now, after that, head at (1,3), direction U.\n> \n> Now, for turn 62, I need to move.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,4), R to (2,3), not D (reverse), not L (wall).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid and food.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) has life span 2, which means it disappears after turn 62, so to eat it, I must be there on turn 61 or 62. Turn 61 I'm at (1,2) moving to (1,3), so not at (6,5). On turn 62, if I can be at (6,5), I can eat it.\n> \n> But (6,5) is currently occupied by the snake? In the initial state, (6,5) is part of the snake, segment 10: positions include (6,5).\n> \n> In initial snake positions: (6,5) is segment 10.\n> \n> After I move to (1,3) and eat food, the snake grows, so positions include (6,5) still, as segment 11 or something.\n> \n> After eating at (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (6,5) is occupied, so food at (6,5) is under the snake body, but according to rules, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (6,5) has food, but it's occupied by the snake body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move such that the segment at (6,5) moves away, and then head moves to (6,5) when it's free.\n> \n> In this case, (6,5) is segment 11 in the new positions? List: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,5), 12: (5,5), 13: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (6,5) is segment 11.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves away, but since (6,5) is not tail, it will move only if the segments ahead move.\n> \n> For (6,5) to become free, the segment there must move, and no one moves to it.\n> \n> But for the food to be accessible, the head needs to be able to move to (6,5) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> Life span: food at (6,5) has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 62. So on turn 61, it's still there, but occupied. On turn 62, if the snake moves and the segment leaves (6,5), and head can move there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But on turn 62, when I move, the segment at (6,5) will move to where segment 10 was, which is (6,4), I think, depending on the move.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> After turn 61, I moved to (1,3), ate food, so positions as above.\n> \n> Now for turn 62, I need to move from (1,3).\n> \n> Suppose I want to go for (6,5) food.\n> \n> But (6,5) is currently occupied, and it's not the tail; tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> When I make a move, each segment moves based on the direction.\n> \n> But to free (6,5), the segment there must move to another cell.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves such that segment 11 moves away from (6,5), then (6,5) becomes empty, and if head moves there, it can eat the food, but only if head moves there on the same turn it becomes free? Not necessarily; it can be later, as long as food is there.\n> \n> But life span is short; only turn 62 left.\n> \n> On turn 62, before move, food at (6,5) is still there, but occupied by segment 11.\n> \n> When I move the head, the entire snake moves: head to new position, each body segment to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So for segment 11 at (6,5), it will move to the position that segment 10 was at before move, which is (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 10 at (6,4) moves to where segment 9 was, (5,4), and so on.\n> \n> After head moves, segment 11 moves to (6,4), so (6,5) becomes empty only if no one moves to it, but since segment 11 moves away, and no new segment added (unless food eaten), (6,5) becomes empty after the move.\n> \n> Then, for the food to be eaten, head must move to (6,5) on a turn when it is free and has food.\n> \n> But on turn 62, if I move such that head goes to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied at the start, so I cannot move there directly; it would be collision.\n> \n> I can only move to a cell that is free or has food, but if occupied by body, I cannot move there.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn 62, (6,5) is occupied by segment 11, so I cannot move head to (6,5); it's invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (6,5) because it's under the body and there's no way to move the head there before it disappears, since the body is on it until it moves away, but when it moves away, the head is not there to eat it immediately.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But in practice, when the body moves away, the cell becomes empty, and then on a subsequent turn, head can move there if food is still present.\n> \n> But in this case, the food disappears after turn 62, so only turn 62 is possible, but on turn 62, at the start, (6,5) is occupied, so head cannot move there. After the move, if the body moves away, (6,5) is empty, but head is not there; head is somewhere else. So I cannot eat it on that turn.\n> \n> Therefore, I think it's impossible to eat the (6,5) food because it's covered and life span too short. So I should ignore it; it will disappear.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food under body, but here (3,1) has food, but (3,1) is also occupied?

The body segments move: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i>1, but head is new.\n> \n> Standard: new head position, then the previous head becomes the first body, and so on, up to the previous second last becomes last body, and the previous tail is removed if no food, but if food eaten, tail is not removed.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 62 move, no food eaten yet, so after moving to (1,4), positions become: head (1,4), then body segments: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — 14 segments? Original 14, after move, head moved to new cell, so the tail cell is vacated, so we have 14 segments but the last one is (5,5) now, which was (6,5) before? Let's index.\n> \n> Original positions at start turn 62: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,5), 12: (5,5), 13: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (1,4): new head at (1,4), then the body: segment 0 moves to where? The body segments shift: new position 1 is old position 0 ( (1,3) ), new position 2 is old position 1 ( (1,2) ), new position 3 is old position 2 ( (2,2) ), ..., up to new position 13 is old position 12 ( (5,5) ), and old position 13 ( (4,5) ) is vacated, so tail is now at (5,5).\n> \n> New positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — (6,5) is new position 12, (5,5) is new position 13, tail.\n> \n> Old position 13 (4,5) is gone.\n> \n> Now, from here, on turn 63, I can move U to (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> After moving to (1,5): head to (1,5), then since food eaten, the body moves: new head (1,5), first body old head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and the tail (5,5) does not move, so it stays, and the snake grows to 15 segments. Positions: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n> \n> Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Is this safe? (1,5) is free, no collision.

We need to think long-term.\n> \n> Another option: move R to (2,3) on turn 62.\n> \n> Then head at (2,3), direction?

If I go there now, I eat it, but is there danger?\n> \n> The tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (1,4), tail at (5,5), distance is large.\n> \n> (1,4) to (5,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share edge, so (1,4) adjacent to (1,5), (1,3), (2,4), (0,4) but wall.\n> \n> Tail at (5,5), so not adjacent, so no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> If I go to (1,5), I eat food, grow. Now snake positions: head at (1,5), then the body: since I moved from (1,4) to (1,5), the segment at (1,4) becomes the new neck, and so on, but since I ate, the tail stays at (5,5), so new positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — and since I ate, I add a new segment at the end, so tail is still (5,5), but after growth, the tail doesn't move, so positions are: after eating, the snake has 15 segments: head at new position, and all previous segments, with tail fixed.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, you grow, so the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't advance, but since it's added at tail, the tail cell remains occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, snake positions: P0, P1, ..., P13 with P0 head (1,4), P13 tail (5,5).\n> \n> After moving to (1,5) and eating, new head is (1,5), and the body: P0 moves to (1,5), so the new body is [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] — since I ate, I add a new segment at the end, which is (5,5), but (5,5) is already the tail, so it stays, and the new tail is still (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Let's think: when you move without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail advances, last position is freed.\n> \n> When you eat, head moves to food, each segment moves to next position, but since you grow, you add a new segment at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and you have one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with H=(1,4), T=(5,5)\n> \n> After moving to new head position N:\n> \n> - If not eating, new positions: [N, H, B1, ..., Bk] and T is removed.\n> \n> - If eating, new positions: [N, H, B1, ..., T] and a new segment is added at T, so [N, H, B1, ..., T, T] but T is the same cell, so it's [N, H, B1, ..., T] with T occupied, and since new segment added, it's like the tail stays.\n> \n> For example, positions: after moving to (1,5) and eating, the head is now (1,5), the previous head (1,4) is now the first body segment, and so on, down to the tail (5,5), but since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail remains at (5,5), and the previous second last is now part of body.\n> \n> So new snake: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and tail (5,5) — (5,5) is the 14th segment, but we have 14 segments before, after eating, 15 segments.\n> \n> Before: 14 segments.\n> \n> After move and eat: head to (1,5), then the body segments shift: the segment that was at (1,4) is now at position 1, (1,3) at position 2, ..., down to (6,5) which was position 12?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves away, and each segment shifts to the next position.\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by the tail is now free.\n> \n> In this case, when snake moves, the segment that was at (3,1) (index 7) will move to the position of index 6, which is (2,1). Then segment at index 8 (4,1) moves to old index 7 position (3,1), so (3,1) is still occupied? No:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head (new position) at, say, (3,5)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 1 at previous head position (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 at previous segment 1 position (1,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Segment 6 at previous segment 5 position (2,2)?

Old tail was index 14 at (6,5), which is not moved to, so cell (6,5) is now free.\n> \n> The tail cell is the last one, index 14 at (6,5). After move, the new snake has positions from new index 0 to new index 14, but the last segment is at old index 13 position (6,4), so cell (6,5) is vacated.\n> \n> For cell (3,1): it was occupied by index 7. After move, index 7 moves to old index 6 position (2,1), and index 8 moves to old index 7 position (3,1), so (3,1) is still occupied by the new index 8 segment.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (3,1) is still under the body after one move. It will take several moves for the body to move away.\n> \n> The food at (3,1) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after turn 68, so it can be eaten until turn 68.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to have the head move to (3,1) when it's free, but currently it's occupied, and it might be occupied for a while.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (4,6) with life span 9, so more time.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate moves.\n> \n> From head (2,5), direction R, possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> U: (2,6)\n> \n> D: (2,4)\n> \n> R: (3,5)\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each.\n> \n> First, R to (3,5): what is there? No food, not wall, not body. After moving, the snake body will be as above, with head at (3,5), body following.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to L, since current direction would be R? After moving to (3,5), the head direction is R, so next turn, cannot move L (left) to (2,5), which is where the body is, but (2,5) will be occupied by the new segment 1, so it would be collision to move there anyway.\n> \n> Similarly, from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, U to (2,6): (2,6) is within bounds, no body, no food. Then from (2,6), possible moves U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to D? Current direction after move would be U, since from (2,5) to (2,6) is up, so direction U, so cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (2,4): from (2,5) to (2,4) is down, direction D, cannot move U next turn.\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead for food and survival.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is under body and will take time to free up. Let's see when (3,1) might be free.\n> \n> The segment at (3,1) is index 7. It will move when the snake moves. After each move, the body shifts.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) is occupied as long as a body segment is there. Currently, index 7 is at (3,1). After one move, index 8 moves to (3,1), as above. Index 8 was at (4,1), moves to (3,1).\n> \n> Then after another move, index 9 moves to (3,1)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> To free (3,1), the tail needs to move away from it or the body shifts.\n> \n> The position (3,1) is occupied by segments as the snake moves.\n> \n> Initially, at turn 65, (3,1) has segment 7.\n> \n> After one move, segment 8 moves to (3,1).\n> \n> After two moves, segment 9 moves to (3,1) — segment 9 was at (4,2), after first move, it moves to old pos 8 which is (4,1), then after second move, it moves to (3,1)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 65: positions as given.\n> \n> After move at turn 65 (turn t1=65 action):\n> \n> Suppose we move to some direction, but let's assume we move in a way that the body shifts.\n> \n> Generally, the cell (3,1) will be occupied until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,5), index 14.\n> \n> The segments from index 7 to 13 are between.\n> \n> The position (3,1) will be occupied by consecutive segments as the snake moves.\n> \n> Specifically, segment 7 at (3,1) now.\n> \n> After one move, segment 8 at (3,1).\n> \n> After two moves, segment 9 at (3,1) — because after first move, segment 9 is at new index 9, which is old (4,2)? Better to think of the cell.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) is currently occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> When segment 7 moves away, but segment 7 will move to the position of segment 6 when the snake moves.\n> \n> After one move, segment 7 moves to where segment 6 was, which is (2,1), so (3,1) is then occupied by segment 8, who moves to where segment 7 was.\n> \n> Similarly, after two moves, segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was after first move, which is (2,1), and segment 9 moves to where segment 8 was, which is (3,1) after first move.\n> \n> Define after k moves.\n> \n> At turn 65, before move, cell (3,1) occupied.\n> \n> After first move (turn 65 action), the snake moves, head new position, then body shifts, so cell (3,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 8, which is (4,1), so (4,1) moves to (3,1), so (3,1) still occupied.\n> \n> After second move (turn 66 action), the segment that was at index 9 moves to (3,1), because after first move, index 9 was at (4,2), and after second move, it moves to the position of index 8 after first move, which is (3,1).\n> \n> After first move: new positions, index 8 at (3,1)\n> \n> After second move: head moves somewhere, then new index 9 moves to old index 8 position, which is (3,1), so (3,1) occupied by new index 9.\n> \n> Similarly, after third move, new index 10 moves to (3,1), and so on.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) will be occupied as long as the body segments are passing through it. Since the snake is long, 15 segments, and (3,1) is in the middle, it will be occupied for several turns.\n> \n> The segment that is at (3,1) now is index 7. The tail is index 14. So there are 7 segments after index 7 (indices 8 to 14), but when the snake moves, the tail moves away.\n> \n> The number of turns until (3,1) is free depends on how many segments are after the one at (3,1).\n> \n> Index 7 at (3,1), then indices 8 to 14 are after it, so 8 segments after, including index 8.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each move, the segment at (3,1) changes, and after 8 moves, the tail would have moved away.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at index (7+k) will be at (3,1), but since there are only 15 segments, after 8 moves, index 7+8=15, which is out of range, so after 7 moves, index 14 might be at (3,1) or something.\n> \n> Let's calculate the distance from the head.\n> \n> The head is at index 0, (2,5).\n> \n> The segment at (3,1) is index 7.\n> \n> The tail is index 14.\n> \n> The number of segments between head and this segment is 6 (indices 1 to 6), but for the cell to be free, we need the tail to have passed.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) will be occupied until the segment that was at index 14 moves away from it, but since it's a fixed cell, it will be occupied as long as some segment is there.\n> \n> The last segment to occupy (3,1) is the one that is currently at the end of the queue.\n> \n> Currently, segment at index 14 is at (6,5), far away.\n> \n> The segment at index 7 is at (3,1), and segments after it will occupy it sequentially.\n> \n> After the first move, segment 8 occupies it.\n> \n> After the second move, segment 9 occupies it.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After the (14-7) = 7th move, segment 14 occupies it.\n> \n> After the 8th move, segment 14 moves away to a new position, and no segment moves to (3,1), so it becomes free.\n> \n> Let's see:\n> \n> After 0 moves: turn 65, segment 7 at (3,1)\n> \n> After 1 move: segment 8 at (3,1)\n> \n> After 2 moves: segment 9 at (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> After 7 moves: segment 14 at (3,1)  because after 7 moves, the segment that was index 14-7=7? After k moves, the segment that was at index (7+k) will be at (3,1) for k from 0 to 7.\n> \n> At k=0, index 7\n> \n> k=1, index 8\n> \n> ...\n> k=7, index 14 at (3,1)\n> \n> Then after the 8th move, when snake moves again, segment 14 moves to where segment 13 was, and no new segment comes to (3,1), so (3,1) is free after the 8th move.\n> \n> The move happens at each turn, so after 8 actions, at the beginning of turn 73, (3,1) is free? Let's think in turns.\n> \n> Turn 65: before action, (3,1) occupied.\n> \n> After action at turn 65, (3,1) still occupied (by segment 8).\n> \n> At turn 66, before action, (3,1) occupied.\n> \n> After action at turn 66, (3,1) occupied by segment 9, and so on.\n> \n> After action at turn 65 +7 = turn 72, after the move, segment 14 is at (3,1).\n> \n> Then at turn 73, before action, (3,1) occupied by segment 14.\n> \n> After action at turn 73, segment 14 moves away to where segment 13 was, and no segment moves to (3,1), so after the move at turn 73, (3,1) is free.\n> \n> But the food life span: at turn 65, life span 4, so it decreases each turn.\n> \n> Turn 65: life span 4, can be eaten\n> \n> Turn 66: life span 3\n> \n> Turn 67: life span 2\n> \n> Turn 68: life span 1\n> \n> Turn 69: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 69.\n> \n> But (3,1) will be free only after turn 73 action, which is too late, since turn 69 it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 73 is after turn 68, so by turn 69 it's gone, so it's impossible to eat the food at (3,1) because it will be under the body until it disappears.\n> \n> Life span 4 at turn 65, so it has 4 turns left: it can be eaten on turns 65,66,67,68.\n> \n> But on these turns, (3,1) is occupied by the body, so the head cannot move there to eat it, and since it's under body, it can't be eaten until the body moves away, which is after turn 73, but by then it's gone.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (3,1) cannot be eaten at all. It's inaccessible because it's under the body and will disappear before the body moves away.\n> \n> So we should ignore this food; it's not reachable.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (4,6) with value 1, life span 9 at turn 65, so it can be eaten from turn 65 to turn 73 (since turn 65:9, 66:8, ..., 73:1, 74:0 gone).\n> \n> (4,6) is not occupied by snake, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,5), so (4,6) is at distance |2-4|=2 in x, |5-6|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 3, so possible to reach in 3 moves, but need to plan the path.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk of collision or dead ends.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 15 segments, so the grid has limited space.\n> \n> Grid size 8x8, walls and obstacles, so free cells: total cells 64, walls: borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so there are 36 free cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (5,2), so free cells: 6x6=36 minus (5,2), so 35 free cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies 15 cells, so 20 free cells.\n> \n> But snake moves, so it changes.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6), which is within bounds, not wall.\n> \n> Now, to reach (4,6) from (2,5): possible paths.\n> \n> For example, one way: move R to (3,5), then U to (3,6), then R to (4,6). That's 3 moves, to eat on turn 67 or 68? Turn 65 action: if move R to (3,5), then turn 66 move U to (3,6), then turn 67 move R to (4,6), and eat on turn 67.\n> \n> Life span at turn 65:9, turn 66:8, turn 67:7, so yes, can eat on turn 67.\n> \n> But need to check if the path is safe.\n> \n> First, from (2,5) to (3,5): is (3,5) safe? As before, not wall, not body. After moving, the body shifts, but (3,5) is new head position.\n> \n> Then from (3,5), move U to (3,6): (3,6) is within bounds, y=6<7, so not wall. Is it body? Current body positions: after first move, head at (3,5), body at (2,5), (1,5), etc., no (3,6), so safe.\n> \n> Then from (3,6), move R to (4,6): (4,6) is the food, and not body, so can eat it.\n> \n> But when eating, the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> But need to check for Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, the food is at (4,6), and tail is at (6,5) or something, not adjacent.\n> \n> At turn 67, when head moves to (4,6), tail is where?\n> \n> We need to simulate the positions.\n> \n> First, turn 65 action: move R to (3,5)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail: (6,4)  // since old tail (6,5) not included, new tail is (6,4)\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 14.\n> \n> After move to (3,5):\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - 0: (3,5)\n> \n> - 1: (2,5)\n> \n> - 2: (1,5)\n> \n> - 3: (1,4)\n> \n> - 4: (1,3)\n> \n> - 5: (1,2)\n> \n> - 6: (2,2)\n> \n> - 7: (2,1)\n> \n> - 8: (3,1)\n> \n> - 9: (4,1)\n> \n> - 10: (4,2)\n> \n> - 11: (4,3)\n> \n> - 12: (5,3)\n> \n> - 13: (5,4)\n> \n> - 14: (6,4)  // new tail, old (6,5) vacated\n> \n> Now turn 66: head at (3,5), direction from previous move: from (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, and also reverse, not allowed, R to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, we plan to move U to (3,6)\n> \n> (3,6): y=6, not wall, not body (positions: (3,5) head, (2,5), etc., no (3,6), so safe.\n> \n> Move U to (3,6)\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> Tail: (5,4)  // old tail (6,4) vacated?

Since it's turn 66, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so by turn 69.\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8, so disappears on turn 74.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to understand positions.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,5), body as above.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) and (4,6).\n> \n> Since head is at (3,5) and direction is R, possible moves now (turn 66): U, D, R (not L because reverse not allowed).\n> \n> U: (3,6) — y=6 is within bounds, since y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is ok? y=0 to y=7, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, which should be accessible? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So cells like (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x. So (3,6): x=3 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so it's free, but y=6 is not wall? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is fine. Similarly, (3,5) is current, which is fine.\n> \n> (3,6): x=3, y=6, not border, so should be ok unless occupied.\n> \n> Now, is (3,6) occupied? Snake positions: from list, no (3,6), so free.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (3,4) — y=4, not border, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,5), (2,5), etc., no (3,4), so free.\n> \n> R: (4,5) — x=4, y=5, not border, not in snake? Snake has (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc., no (4,5), so free.\n> \n> L: (2,5) — but (2,5) is the second segment of snake, so body collision if I move there? But the tail might move.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail's current position because the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (2,5), which is currently occupied by the body, but since it's the segment right after head, and when head moves, the tail moves, so after move, (2,5) will be the new head or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at (2,5) will move to where? Current positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5), etc.\n> \n> If head moves left to (2,5), but (2,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the head would be at (2,5), and the body segment that was at (2,5) would move to... but since head is now at (2,5), and it was moving to a cell that had a body, but in snake games, if head moves to the cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but here (2,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Specifically, collision occurs if head touches any body segment after the move. But when moving to (2,5), which is currently occupied, after move, that cell will be the head, and the body will shift, so the segment that was at (2,5) moves to (1,5) or something, but the head is now at (2,5), which was occupied, but since the body moves away, it might be ok? But the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (2,5) is not the tail; it's the neck, right after head. So moving to (2,5) would cause collision because after move, head is at (2,5) and the body is still there? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Before move: positions: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (1,5), etc.\n> \n> If head moves left to (2,5): new head position (2,5). But (2,5) was occupied by the first body segment. After head moves to (2,5), that segment is now head, and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (2,5) needs to move, but it moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, which was head at (3,5), but head moved, so the new body should be at (3,5)? Standard: when head moves to new cell, the tail end moves forward one cell.\n> \n> Positions: let's index them. Segment 0: head (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 1: (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: (1,5)\n> \n> Segment 3: (1,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 14: tail (6,4)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,5), which is currently segment 1's position. After move, new head is at (2,5), and segment 1 (which was at (2,5)) moves to where segment 0 was, which is (3,5)? No.\n> \n> The movement: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (2,5), new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: moves to old head position (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: moves to old segment 1 position (2,5), but (2,5) is now head, so it moves to (2,5)? Confusion.\n> \n> Better: after head moves to (2,5), the segment that was at (2,5) becomes the new segment 1 and moves to where the head was, (3,5). Then segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which is now (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Order: the body segments follow the head. When head moves, the segment immediately behind it moves to the head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> So, initially: positions: seg0: (3,5), seg1: (2,5), seg2: (1,5), etc.\n> \n> Head moves to (2,5). New seg0: (2,5)\n> \n> Then, seg1 (which was at (2,5)) now moves to seg0's old position (3,5)\n> \n> Then seg2 moves to seg1's old position (2,5), but (2,5) is now occupied by head? No, after head moves to (2,5), seg1 moves to (3,5), which is now free because head left. Then seg2 moves to where seg1 was, which is (2,5), but (2,5) is now head, so seg2 would move to (2,5), which is occupied by head? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake body is a list of positions. When the head moves to a new cell, that new cell becomes the new head position. Then, the tail position is removed, but since we're eating food or not, in this case, if not eating, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> In movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from the end. So the snake slides forward.\n> \n> So for moving left to (2,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - Since no food eaten, tail at (6,4) is removed.\n> \n> - The body segments: the segment that was at (2,5) will move to (3,5)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> New head position: (2,5)\n> \n> Then, the previous head position (3,5) becomes the new position for the segment that was behind it, which is seg1 at (2,5). But seg1 was at (2,5), and now it needs to move to the old head position (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, seg2 at (1,5) moves to the old position of seg1, which was (2,5), but (2,5) is now head, so it moves to (2,5)? No.\n> \n> The positions shift: the body segment i moves to the position of segment i-1 from the previous state.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New segment 0 (head): (2,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old segment 0 position (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,5) — but (2,5) is now new head, so it's occupied? This is messy.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that when head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift forward, so the segment that was at position k moves to position k-1 for k>0, but position is the coordinate.\n> \n> List the positions in order before move:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (1,4)\n> \n> ... up to index 14: (6,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,5):\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Index 0: (2,5)  // new head\n> \n> - Index 1: (3,5)  // where index 0 was\n> \n> - Index 2: (2,5)  // where index 1 was? But (2,5) is now index 0, so conflict.\n> \n> The new position for index 1 is the old position of index 0, which is (3,5).\n> \n> New position for index 2 is the old position of index 1, which is (2,5).\n> \n> But (2,5) is the new head position, so at the same time, (2,5) is occupied by both new head and new index 2? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the head moves to a new cell, that cell becomes the new head, and then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the old list. But since the tail is removed if no food, the last position is vacated.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned, so the new snake has the new head position and the first L-1 positions of the old snake, but shifted.\n> \n> Old positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P14\n> \n> Head moves to new position P_new.\n> \n> Then new positions: P_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P13  (since tail P14 is removed)\n> \n> So the length decreases by 1, but only if no food eaten. In this case, since we're not eating, length should decrease? But the rules say when eating positive food, length +1, negative food length unchanged, no food length unchanged? Let's check.\n> \n> Food mechanics: \"Positive Food: Length of snake +1\", \"Negative Food: Length of snake unchanged\", and when no food, I think length unchanged, so tail is not removed, but head moves, so the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In standard snake, when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake moves forward, length same.\n> \n> In the description, it doesn't explicitly say, but from the food, when eating positive, length +1, so tail not removed; for negative, length unchanged, so tail removed? No.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\" so when eaten, snake grows, so tail not removed.\n> \n> \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\" so when eaten, length same, so tail not removed? Or removed?\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity.\n> \n> When you eat food, you grow, so for positive food, you add a new segment, so tail stays.\n> \n> For negative food, since length unchanged, I think you don't grow, so tail is removed when moving, so length same.\n> \n> When no food, no growth, tail removed, length same.\n> \n> In terms of movement: if no food eaten during the move, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, and all segments shift.\n> \n> If food eaten at new head position, then head moves to food cell, tail not removed, so new segment added at head, and body shifts, but tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Similarly for negative food, if eaten, head moves to food, but since length unchanged, tail is removed or not? The description says \"Length of snake unchanged\" for negative food, so I think it means that eating negative food doesn't cause growth, so when you move to a cell with negative food, you eat it (get penalty), but since length unchanged, the tail is still removed, so no growth.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, tail removed.\n> \n> Only for positive food, tail not removed, so growth.\n> \n> In the case of moving to a body cell.\n> \n> Back to our case: moving left to (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is currently occupied by segment 1.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,5), and (2,5) has no food, so no eating, then after move, new head at (2,5), and the tail is removed, so new positions: new head at (2,5), then old head position (3,5) becomes new segment 1, old segment 1 position (2,5) is now head, so old segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position? Let's list.\n> \n> Old positions: P0: (3,5), P1: (2,5), P2: (1,5), P3: (1,4), ..., P14: (6,4)\n> \n> Head moves to (2,5), which is old P1.\n> \n> Since no food at (2,5), we assume, so tail is removed.\n> \n> New positions: new P0: (2,5)  // new head\n> \n> Then new P1: old P0 = (3,5)\n> \n> New P2: old P1 = (2,5)  but (2,5) is new head, so new P2 should be at (2,5)? That's a problem.\n> \n> The new position for P1 is the old P0 position.\n> \n> New position for P2 is the old P1 position.\n> \n> But old P1 position is (2,5), which is where the new head is, so after the move, both head and segment 2 are at (2,5), which is collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment (except the tail) causes collision because after the move, that cell will have multiple segments.\n> \n> For the tail, it's different because when you move to the tail's current position, the tail moves away, so it's vacated.\n> \n> In this case, (2,5) is not the tail; it's the neck.\n> \n> So moving to (2,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, in the rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> For other body segments, you cannot.\n> \n> So here, for turn 66, moving L to (2,5) is invalid because it's occupied by body segment and not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4), far away.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5) with direction R: U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), R (right to (4,5)).\n> \n> L is not possible.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are free:\n> \n> (3,6): not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,5), (3,1), etc., no (3,6), so free.\n> \n> (3,4): not wall, not in snake? Snake has (3,5), (4,3), etc., no (3,4), so free.\n> \n> (4,5): not wall, not in snake? Snake has (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), no (4,5), so free.\n> \n> Also, no food at these cells currently, I think.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) and (4,6), not at (3,6), (3,4), (4,5).\n> \n> So all three moves are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,1) has life span 3, so if not eaten by turn 69, it disappears. Turn 66 now, so turns 66,67,68,69 it disappears after turn 69? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 66, life span 3, so after turn 66, it becomes 2, then after turn 67, 1, after turn 68, 0, so it disappears before turn 69 or on turn 69? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 66, for food at (3,1), life span 3, so on turn 66, countdown is 3. After turn 66, it decreases to 2 (before turn 67), so on turn 67, countdown 2, turn 68 countdown 1, turn 69 countdown 0, so it disappears after turn 69, meaning not available on turn 69 or after? Disappears after N turns, so if life span N, it is available for N turns including the current one if present.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on the turn it is present, countdown starts at N, and decreases each turn.\n> \n> When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Assume that on turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t, so it disappears after turn t+L-1 or something.\n> \n> For example, at turn 66, life span 3, so it is available on turns 66,67,68, and disappears before turn 69.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 67, if not eaten, life span 2, available turns 67,68, disappears before 69.\n> \n> So to eat it, must be eaten by turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6) life span 8, available from turn 66 to turn 73, disappears before 74.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), we need to get to food.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to the foods.\n> \n> Food at (3,1): current head (3,5), so down 4 steps, but there are obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6): from (3,5), up to (3,6) then right to (4,6)? (4,6) is adjacent to (3,6) and (4,5), etc.\n> \n> But snake body is in the way.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free, similarly y=1 to 6 free? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are free cells.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) is in snake, so free.\n> \n> (1,6) should be free if not occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (5,2) is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From snake: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n> \n> Also, food at (3,1) and (4,6)\n> \n> (3,1) is also a snake segment, since (3,1) is in positions, index 8 or something: positions: 0:(3,5),1:(2,5),2:(1,5),3:(1,4),4:(1,3),5:(1,2),6:(2,2),7:(2,1),8:(3,1),9:(4,1),10:(4,2),11:(4,3),12:(5,3),13:(5,4),14:(6,4)\n> \n> So (3,1) is segment 8, body segment.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is on a cell occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

Invalid (collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (2,6) → Free (no wall or body).\n4. **Right (R)**: (4,6) → Free and has food (+1).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Move R to (4,6)**:\n  - Eat food (+1), grow to length 16.\n  - New head at (4,6), body extends to include (3,6), etc., tail remains at (5,4).\n  - Next moves: From (4,6), can go D to (4,5) or R to (5,6). Both are safe and lead toward other food (e.g., (6,4)).\n\n- **Move L to (2,6)**:\n  - No food eaten.\n  - New head at (2,6), body extends to (3,6), etc., tail moves to (5,3).\n  - Next move from (2,6): Only L to (1,6) is valid (U/D/R are blocked).\n  - From (1,6), no valid moves (trapped).

It's turn 67. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are impassable.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Head direction is Up, so it's moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 67, life span 2 means it disappears after turn 68? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after N turns. At turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + N. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For food at (3,1): life span 2 at turn 67. So after turn 67, life span becomes 1? No: at turn 67, life span is 2, meaning it will decrease to 1 after this turn (after processing turn 67), so it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68, and disappears after turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6): life span 7, value 1. Can be eaten from turn 67 to 73 (since 67+7-1=73, disappears after turn 74? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L:\n> \n> - At start of turn t: life span L\n> \n> - After move and eat check, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> - If life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,1): L=2 at turn 67. After turn 67, if not eaten, L=1. Then after turn 68, if not eaten, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): L=7 at turn 67, can be eaten from turn 67 to 73 (7 turns, from t to t+L-1).\n> \n> (6,4): L=10, value 1, can be eaten from turn 67 to 76.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,6) and direction is Up. So from (3,6), moving Up would go to (3,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Moving Down to (3,5), but (3,5) is the second segment of the snake, so that would be a collision. Moving Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6). (4,6) has food, but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> First, list possible actions from current position (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - this is occupied by snake body, segment at index 1: (3,5). Since the tail will move, but when the head moves to a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and the tail moves away. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is collision except if it's the tail cell. Here, (3,5) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), etc., down to (5,4). So (3,5) is the neck, directly behind head. If head moves to (3,5), it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body segment except the tail is fatal.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4). So from (3,6), moving to (3,5) is body collision, not allowed.\n> \n> L: (2,6) - is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (2,6) is not in this list. Also, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2). (2,6) is within bounds: x=2 between 0 and 7, y=6 between 0 and 7, not (5,2), so should be free.\n> \n> R: (4,6) - not in snake positions, and no wall there, so free. Also, there is food at (4,6).\n> \n> D: (3,5) - occupied, collision.\n> \n> U: (3,7) - wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves are L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> R to (4,6) has food with value +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, head direction is U, but since U is invalid, I can choose L or R. Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. But D is invalid anyway. Moving L or R is not opposite to U, since U is vertical, L and R are horizontal. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1): this is under the snake body? (3,1) is part of the snake positions: index 9, (3,1). So food is at (3,1), which is occupied by a body segment. According to rule, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, for (3,1) food: it's under the body at (3,1). To eat it, the snake must move so that (3,1) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 67, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,6)\n> \n> Possible actions now: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), I eat the food there immediately, since (4,6) has food. Value +1, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment added, so positions will be: head to (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, and so on, with tail staying or moving? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving head to food, a new segment is added at the tail? No, in Snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and since it's food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. Yes.\n> \n> So if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, grows, so tail remains in place, new segment added.\n> \n> If not, head moves to empty cell, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,6), body includes (3,6), (3,5), etc., and tail (5,4) stays, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), ..., (5,4), (5,4)? No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the positions: after move, head is at (4,6), then the previous positions from index 0 to end, but since no tail move, the last segment remains, and a new segment is added at the end? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail vacates.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, new head position, body segments move, but tail does not vacate, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, then the previous head position, then the rest, and the tail position is duplicated or something? Example.\n> \n> Suppose positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: head to new, then [new, H, B1, ..., B_{last}], and T is removed? Positions list: head moves to new cell, then each body segment takes the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food, body segments move as above, but since eating, the tail position is not vacated; instead, the tail remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of list: after move to food, new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, ..., old_T] , so the tail is still there, and the list is longer by one.\n> \n> In this case, old_head was at (3,6), after moving to (4,6), new head at (4,6), then old positions: (3,6) becomes body, (3,5) becomes next, etc., down to (5,4) still tail.\n> \n> So positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (5,4) is still there, and we add a new segment? No: when eating, the tail does not advance, so the last segment remains, and no new segment is added yet? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell. So the positions list gains one more element: the new head position, and all previous positions are kept, with the tail staying put.\n> \n> For example, before: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new positions [new_pos, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] so tail Pk is removed.\n> \n> After moving to food: new positions [new_pos, P0, P1, ..., Pk] so all previous positions kept, tail Pk remains, and new head, so length increased by one.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, if I move R to (4,6), which has food, so after move: head at (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — same as before but head at (4,6), and (3,6) added to body, tail (5,4) still there, and since ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] length 16 now, was 15 before?

It's turn 67. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are impassable.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Head direction is Up, so it's moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 67, life span 2 means it disappears after turn 68? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after N turns. At turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + N. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For food at (3,1): life span 2 at turn 67. So after turn 67, life span becomes 1? No: at turn 67, life span is 2, meaning it will decrease to 1 after this turn (after processing turn 67), so it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68, and disappears after turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6): life span 7, value 1. Can be eaten from turn 67 to 73 (since 67+7-1=73, disappears after turn 74? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L:\n> \n> - At start of turn t: life span L\n> \n> - After move and eat check, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> - If life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,1): L=2 at turn 67. After turn 67, if not eaten, L=1. Then after turn 68, if not eaten, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): L=7 at turn 67, can be eaten from turn 67 to 73 (7 turns, from t to t+L-1).\n> \n> (6,4): L=10, value 1, can be eaten from turn 67 to 76.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,6) and direction is Up. So from (3,6), moving Up would go to (3,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Moving Down to (3,5), but (3,5) is the second segment of the snake, so that would be a collision. Moving Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6). (4,6) has food, but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> First, list possible actions from current position (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - this is occupied by snake body, segment at index 1: (3,5). Since the tail will move, but when the head moves to a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and the tail moves away. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is collision except if it's the tail cell. Here, (3,5) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), etc., down to (5,4). So (3,5) is the neck, directly behind head. If head moves to (3,5), it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body segment except the tail is fatal.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4). So from (3,6), moving to (3,5) is body collision, not allowed.\n> \n> L: (2,6) - is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (2,6) is not in this list. Also, walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2). (2,6) is within bounds: x=2 between 0 and 7, y=6 between 0 and 7, not (5,2), so should be free.\n> \n> R: (4,6) - not in snake positions, and no wall there, so free. Also, there is food at (4,6).\n> \n> D: (3,5) - occupied, collision.\n> \n> U: (3,7) - wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves are L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> R to (4,6) has food with value +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, head direction is U, but since U is invalid, I can choose L or R. Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. But D is invalid anyway. Moving L or R is not opposite to U, since U is vertical, L and R are horizontal. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1): this is under the snake body? (3,1) is part of the snake positions: index 9, (3,1). So food is at (3,1), which is occupied by a body segment. According to rule, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, for (3,1) food: it's under the body at (3,1). To eat it, the snake must move so that (3,1) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 67, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 67 or 68.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,6)\n> \n> Possible actions now: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), I eat the food there immediately, since (4,6) has food. Value +1, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment added, so positions will be: head to (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, and so on, with tail staying or moving? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving head to food, a new segment is added at the tail? No, in Snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and since it's food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. Yes.\n> \n> So if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, grows, so tail remains in place, new segment added.\n> \n> If not, head moves to empty cell, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,6), body includes (3,6), (3,5), etc., and tail (5,4) stays, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), ..., (5,4), (5,4)? No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the positions: after move, head is at (4,6), then the previous positions from index 0 to end, but since no tail move, the last segment remains, and a new segment is added at the end? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail vacates.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, new head position, body segments move, but tail does not vacate, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, then the previous head position, then the rest, and the tail position is duplicated or something? Example.\n> \n> Suppose positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: head to new, then [new, H, B1, ..., B_{last}], and T is removed? Positions list: head moves to new cell, then each body segment takes the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food, body segments move as above, but since eating, the tail position is not vacated; instead, the tail remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of list: after move to food, new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, ..., old_T] , so the tail is still there, and the list is longer by one.\n> \n> In this case, old_head was at (3,6), after moving to (4,6), new head at (4,6), then old positions: (3,6) becomes body, (3,5) becomes next, etc., down to (5,4) still tail.\n> \n> So positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (5,4) is still there, and we add a new segment? No: when eating, the tail does not advance, so the last segment remains, and no new segment is added yet? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell. So the positions list gains one more element: the new head position, and all previous positions are kept, with the tail staying put.\n> \n> For example, before: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new positions [new_pos, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] so tail Pk is removed.\n> \n> After moving to food: new positions [new_pos, P0, P1, ..., Pk] so all previous positions kept, tail Pk remains, and new head, so length increased by one.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, if I move R to (4,6), which has food, so after move: head at (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — same as before but head at (4,6), and (3,6) added to body, tail (5,4) still there, and since ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] length 16 now, was 15 before? Before: positions had 15 elements: indices 0 to 14? Let's count.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] — that's 15 positions: head (3,6) to tail (5,4).\n> \n> After moving to (4,6) and eating: head to (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes first body, then (3,5), (2,5), ..., down to (5,4) which is still tail, and since ate, no tail move, so positions are [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] so 16 positions, length 16.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,6), no food there, so after move: head to (2,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), ..., up to (5,3) becomes new tail?

After turn t + N - 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But since it says \"including current\", it might decrease before the action or after.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that at the start of turn, life span is given, and after the turn, it decreases.

But current direction is the direction it was moving when it arrived, so for turn 71, I choose the next move.\n> \n> Action sequence is for turns starting from t1=71.\n> \n> So for turn 71, I need to choose action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> Current head position (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid, death.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,5), but (5,5) is the first body segment. Can I move there?\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's occupied by body except the tail, it dies. But if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but only if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Standard snake: moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, so the head occupies where tail was, and tail moves to next, so no collision.\n> \n> But here, it says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, for food under body, it can be eaten only if body moves away first.\n> \n> Back to moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - is this valid? y=6, but border walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells y=1 to y=6 are free? Let's see: walls y=0 and y=7, so for y, 1 to 6 are playable.\n> \n> Similarly x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 playable.\n> \n> But internal obstacle (5,2).\n> \n> (6,6): x=6, y=6, is it occupied? Snake positions: head at (6,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), etc. (5,6) is at (5,6), so (6,6) is free? List all occupied: from positions: (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> So (6,6) is not in list, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> But (6,6) is at border? x=6, y=6, x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall. Similarly y=6 not wall, y=7 is wall. So (6,6) is playable.\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - food is here, with value +1. Is it free? Positions: (6,4) not in snake positions, and not wall, so yes.\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - x=7 is wall, so invalid, death if move there.\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - (5,5) is the first body segment, index 1. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision, death. Tail is at (4,2), so (5,5) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> D to (6,4) would eat the food, since it's positive food at (6,4).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, head direction: after move, the direction will be set to the move I make.\n> \n> Currently head direction is R, meaning it came from left.\n> \n> After action, for turn 72, the head direction will be whatever I choose now.\n> \n> Now, food life spans: (6,4) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 71, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 77? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So on turn when it appears, life span N, decreases each turn, so after N turns it disappears.\n> \n> If life span is L on turn T, it disappears at the end of turn T + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> For example, on turn T, food has life span N. On turn T, countdown N, after turn, countdown N-1. After N turns, countdown 0, disappears.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N on turn T, it will be there for N more turns, including current, so it disappears after turn T + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose food spawned on turn S with life span N. On turn S, life span N. After turn S, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until turn S + N - 1, life span 1, after that turn, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn S + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,4), on turn 71, life span 7, so it was spawned on turn 71 - (7 - k) or something. Better to think remaining turns.\n> \n> On turn 71, life span 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including turn 71. So it will disappear after turn 77. That is, on turn 78 it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 9 on turn 71, so disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> But (1,2) is under snake body now.\n> \n> Now, eating (6,4) immediately: if I move down to (6,4), I eat it, snake grows by one segment. Since value +1, length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the new segment is added at the head position after move, so head moves to (6,4), and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move, snake length becomes 17.\n> \n> Then, positions: new head at (6,4), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, and so on, tail stays.\n> \n> But tail is at (4,2), which will not move since we ate food.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,2), head at (6,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (4,2) to (6,5) is not adjacent, distance is 2 in x and 3 in y, so not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I eat (6,4), I get +1, but then head is at (6,4), which might be risky.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), head direction down.\n> \n> Possible next moves from there.\n> \n> But let's think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Alternative: move up to (6,6).\n> \n> Then head at (6,6), direction up.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (6,6): U not possible, y=6, U would be (6,7) which is wall. D to (6,5), but (6,5) is now body? After move to (6,6), the snake: head at (6,6), then (6,5) is body, (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n> \n> After move to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), then body: (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — tail is still (4,2), and since no food eaten, tail moves to next position? When no food, tail moves, so after moving head to (6,6), the tail (4,2) moves to the previous position of the second last segment? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,6) without eating, then: head to (6,6), body segments shift: position 1 (was (5,5)) moves to (6,5) which was head, but let's index.\n> \n> Positions before move: index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), ..., 15: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (6,6): new head (6,6), then body: segment 0 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When head moves, the body follows: the new position 1 is the old position 0, position 2 is old position 1, and so on, up to position 15 is old position 14, and old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So after move U: head (6,6), body: (6,5) [old head], (5,5) [old pos1], (5,6) [old pos2], (4,6) [old pos3], (3,6) [old pos4], (3,5) [old pos5], (2,5) [old pos6], (1,5) [old pos7], (1,4) [old pos8], (1,3) [old pos9], (1,2) [old pos10], (2,2) [old pos11], (2,1) [old pos12], (3,1) [old pos13], (4,1) [old pos14], and old pos15 (4,2) is vacated, so tail is now at (4,1)? New positions: head (6,6), then pos1: (6,5), pos2: (5,5), pos3: (5,6), pos4: (4,6), pos5: (3,6), pos6: (3,5), pos7: (2,5), pos8: (1,5), pos9: (1,4), pos10: (1,3), pos11: (1,2), pos12: (2,2), pos13: (2,1), pos14: (3,1), pos15: (4,1) — and (4,2) is free now.\n> \n> Tail is (4,1).\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is still there, but now (1,2) is occupied by pos11, so still under body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) is still there.\n> \n> Now back to turn 71 decision.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (6,4), eat food.\n> \n> Then positions: head at (6,4), and since ate, new segment, so body: (6,4) head, then (6,5) [old head], (5,5) [old pos1], (5,6) [old pos2], ..., up to (4,2) [old tail], and new tail or what? Length increases, so positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — and since ate, tail is still (4,2), but now there is a new segment at the end? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new position after head is the old head, and so on, with the tail staying, so the new position list has one more segment.\n> \n> Before: 16 segments.\n> \n> After eating: head to new position (6,4), then the old positions from 0 to 15 are all kept, but shifted, with old tail still there? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats and moves to food, the head occupies the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, you move the head to the food, and you don't remove the tail, so the snake grows by one cell. The new body segment is effectively added at the tail end, but since tail doesn't move, the position that was tail is still occupied, and the new tail is the same as before, but now there's an additional segment.\n> \n> After move to (6,4) with eat: head at (6,4), then the first body segment is the previous head (6,5), then the next is previous pos1 (5,5), and so on, up to previous pos15 (4,2), and since no tail removal, (4,2) is still there, so now 17 segments: positions from head to tail: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> Tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Head direction now down.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is still there, under body segment (1,2), which is pos11 in new list?

We have 7 turns (73-79) to reach it. Here's a possible path:\n1. Turn 72: D to (6,3)\n2. Turn 73: L to (5,3)\n3. Turn 74: L to (4,3)\n4. Turn 75: D to (4,2)\n5. Turn 76: L to (3,2)\n6. Turn 77: L to (2,2)\n7. Turn 78: L to (1,2) → Eat the food.\n\nThis sequence reaches the food by Turn 78 (within the lifespan).\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 72:\nBoth D and L are safe, but moving **Down (D)** first aligns better with the path to the food (as it starts moving the head closer to the food's y-coordinate). \n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{D}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 72 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 2, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 72 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 72. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (1,1) to (6,6) since walls occupy the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). That's 17 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Body: (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> Tail is (4,2). Snake head direction is down, which is decreasing y, so from (6,4), moving down would go to (6,3).\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 8. But life span is 8, and it's turn 72, so it will disappear after 8 more turns, including this one, so by turn 80 it's gone.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (1,2). Looking at snake positions, (1,2) is part of the snake's body! Specifically, it's the 12th segment: positions are (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), ... so (1,2) is occupied by the snake.\n> \n> But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So since the food is at (1,2), which is currently occupied, the snake needs to move so that this cell is vacated, then the head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\". If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide. But in this case, the food is at (1,2), which is not the tail; tail is at (4,2). (1,2) is somewhere in the middle.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,4), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So from (6,4) with direction down:\n> \n> - Down: (6,3)\n> \n> - Left: (5,4)\n> \n> - Right: but x=7 is wall, so right to (7,4) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) but that's reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (6,3), Left to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, (6,3): is it safe? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,3) is within bounds. Snake positions: current body segments: (6,5), (5,5), etc., not (6,3), so it's empty? Let me list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> So (6,3) is not in this list, and not a wall, so it should be safe to move to.\n> \n> (5,4): not in snake positions, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2), value +1, life span 8, so we have 8 turns to eat it.\n> \n> But it's under the snake body at (1,2). To eat it, we need to move the snake so that (1,2) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (1,2) is occupied by the snake, so as the snake moves, when the segment at (1,2) moves away, it becomes empty, then if head moves there, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food might be there only if it hasn't disappeared.\n> \n> Life span 8, starting from turn 72, so it will be there for turns 72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79. Disappears after turn 79, so last chance to eat is on turn 79.\n> \n> Now, we need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Current score: not given, but we start from turn 72, and we have one food to eat.\n> \n> But there might be other foods later, but only one is given now, so probably only this food is present.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions: (1,2,8,1)\" so only one food.\n> \n> Now, to eat the food at (1,2), which is currently occupied.\n> \n> The snake needs to vacate (1,2) so that the food can be accessible.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (1,2) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake's movement.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), moving down.\n> \n> Possible actions: D or L.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,3), then the tail will move forward? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> But no food eaten yet, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Current tail is (4,2).\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, say (6,3), then the body: (6,4) becomes new body segment 1, (6,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to (4,1) becomes segment 16, and (4,2) is tail and is removed, so the new tail is where (4,1) was?

To eat them, the snake must move such that the body moves away from the food cell, and then the head can move onto it.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Down (D) to (6, 2)**:\n   - From (6, 2), the only safe move is Down to (6, 1), leading to a potential dead end.\n   - This path doesn't seem to help in freeing the food cells soon.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - This move starts heading towards the left side of the grid where the foods are located.\n   - It provides more flexibility for future moves to eventually free and eat the foods.\n\n### Plan to Eat Food at (1, 2):\n- The food at (1, 2) will be freed when the tail moves away from it. The tail is currently at (4, 1), and it will take several moves to reach (1, 2).\n- By moving left now, we can start positioning the snake to be near (1, 2) when it becomes free (around turn 78).\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger:\n- The food at (1, 2) will be under the tail on turn 78. Eating it directly then would cause a collision (head and tail at same cell after growth).\n- Instead, we need to ensure that when we eat (1, 2), it is not under the tail. This requires careful timing, but moving left now is a step towards that goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (5, 3) to start positioning the snake towards the food at (1, 2) and avoid dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t to t + N - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L turns, from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L. But since we're at turn 73, and life span is given, we need to know when it expires.\n> \n> For (1,2): value 1, life span 7 at turn 73.

Turn 73: 10, decreases to 9 on 74, ..., down to 1 on turn 82, disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,3), direction Down.

But (1,2) is occupied by the snake! Let's see: snake positions include (1,2), which is the 13th segment? List with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (6,3)\n> 1: (6,4)\n> 2: (6,5)\n> 3: (5,5)\n> 4: (5,6)\n> 5: (4,6)\n> 6: (3,6)\n> 7: (3,5)\n> 8: (2,5)  // food at (2,5) is here?

The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, for (1,2): it's under the body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that (1,2) is vacated, then head moves there. Similarly for (2,5).\n> \n> But head is at (6,3), far from these.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> - Down: to (6,2)\n> - Left: to (5,3)\n> - Right: but x=7 is wall, so (7,3) is invalid, cannot move Right.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so from (6,3), moving Right to (7,3) is wall, not allowed. Moving Left to (5,3), Down to (6,2), or Up to (6,4) but Up is opposite to current direction Down, so cannot move Up.\n> \n> So only possible: Left to (5,3) or Down to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe.\n> \n> (5,3): is it occupied or wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2). (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is not a wall. Snake positions: (5,3) is not in the list? List has (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), etc. (5,3) not listed, so empty? Let's see all positions.\n> \n> Snake: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (5,3) is not occupied, and not wall except internal (5,2) which is different. (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): y=2, x=6. Walls: x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall; y=2 not wall. But internal obstacle at (5,2), which is different cell. (6,2) should be free? Snake positions: no (6,2), so empty.\n> \n> Also, moving to (6,2) or (5,3) should not cause immediate collision.\n> \n> After moving, the snake moves: head to new position, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> So for next turn, if I move to (5,3) or (6,2), it should be safe.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,2) and (2,5) are under snake body, so I need to free them to eat.\n> \n> (1,2) is currently occupied by snake segment at position 12.

Cannot move there. Right to (7,2) wall, invalid. Up to (6,3), but (6,3) is now body? After moving to (6,2), the new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), etc. (6,3) is now segment 1, so moving Up to (6,3) would be body collision? No, because when I move, the body moves, so if I move to (6,3), it's occupied by the former head, but since the snake moves, the segment at (6,3) will move to where the head was? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - Tail segment moves away, freeing that cell.\n> \n> So if head moves from (6,3) to (6,2), then new head is (6,2), position 0: (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,5)? Original positions: before move: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,4), 2:(6,5), 3:(5,5), ...\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2): new positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(6,3) [was 0], 2:(6,4) [was 1], 3:(6,5) [was 2], 4:(5,5) [was 3], and so on, tail (4,1) moves to where? The segment that was tail (4,1) will be gone, since head moved, new tail is what was second last.\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0 to 16.\n> \n> After move: new head at new position, then segment 1 to 16 become the body, but shifted: the cell that was index 0 is now occupied by index 1, etc.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at index i moves to where index i-1 was, for i=1 to len-1. Index 0 moves to new head, index 1 moves to where index 0 was, index 2 to where index 1 was, ..., index 16 moves to where index 15 was, and the cell where index 16 was becomes free.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (6,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: (6,3)  // was head\n> \n> - New segment 2: (6,4)  // was segment 1\n> \n> - New segment 3: (6,5)  // was segment 2\n> \n> - New segment 4: (5,5)  // was segment 3\n> \n> - ... and so on, up to new segment 16: (3,1)  // was segment 15?

On turn 77, I move to (2,2), which is free, no food there. Food is at (1,2), occupied. Then on turn 78, I move to (1,2) to eat, and tail is at (1,2), but when I move head to (1,2), tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> The danger is only if I eat when head is adjacent to tail and I eat the food on tail, but since tail moves, it should be fine.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, on turn 78, when I move to (1,2), the tail is at (1,2), so head is not adjacent to tail; I'm moving to the tail cell.\n> \n> But after moving, head at (1,2), tail was at (1,2) but moves to where it should, and since I eat, the tail doesn't move away?

No.\n> \n> General movement: when moving without eating, head moves, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, body follows, but tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the previous tail position, thus length increases.\n> \n> In this case, when I move head to (1,2) on turn 78, which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (1,2), the body moves such that segment 1 moves to where head was, etc., but the tail does not move; it stays, so the new tail is at the same position as before, but since I add a segment, the position where tail was is now occupied by the new segment, and the tail extends.\n> \n> Specifically, when eating, after moving head to food, the tail remains, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, head at H, body, tail at T.\n> \n> After moving to food F, new head at F, the segment that was at H moves to H, but since you eat, the tail T does not move; it stays, so the new positions are: head at F, then the previous head position H becomes segment 1, and so on, down to tail T which remains, and since length increases, T is still there, but now it's not the tail; the new tail is the segment that was second last or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After moving head to food F without eating: new positions [F, H, B1], tail was T, now gone.\n> \n> With eating: move head to F, eat, so new positions [F, H, B1, B2, T], so T remains, and B2 is now part, but T is the tail.\n> \n> In this case, the tail does not move; it stays.\n> \n> In our case, on turn 77, head at (2,2), tail at (1,2).\n> \n> Turn 78: move head to (1,2), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> New head at (1,2), then the previous head position (2,2) becomes segment 1, and so on, down to tail (1,2) which was tail, but now since we eat, the tail remains at (1,2), so new head at (1,2), and tail at (1,2), but same cell?

Will be vacated after the snake moves.\n2. **(2, 5)**: Life span 7 (can be eaten on turns 76-82)\n   - Currently under snake body (segment 11). Will be vacated after the snake moves.\n3. **(1, 4)**: Life span 10 (can be eaten on turns 76-85)\n   - Currently under snake body (segment 13). Will be vacated after the snake moves.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nTo maximize score, we should aim to eat the food with the shortest life span first, which is (1, 2). \n\n#### Plan to Eat (1, 2):\n1. **Turn 76**: Move left to (3, 2).\n   - This positions the snake closer to (1, 2).\n2. **Turn 77**: Move left to (2, 2).\n   - Now adjacent to (1, 2).\n3. **Turn 78**: Move left to (1, 2) to eat the food.\n   - This is within the food's life span (turns 76-79).\n\n#### Why Not Move Down?\n- Moving down to (4, 1) does not help in reaching (1, 2) in time to eat it before it disappears (as calculated in the guidance).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action at Turn 76 should be to move left (L) to start the sequence towards eating (1, 2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 76. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (5,2) which is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), direction is D (down). The full snake body is: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]. That's 17 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after turn 76+4=80? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 76, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including turn 76. So it will disappear after turn 79, and can be eaten up to turn 79. But eating happens when head moves onto it, so on the turn it's eaten.\n> \n> Life span: decreases every turn, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N turns. So if eaten on turn t, it's gone. If not eaten, it disappears at the start of turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 76, life span 4: it exists on turns 76,77,78,79. It can be eaten on any of these turns. After turn 79, it's gone at turn 80.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4 → can be eaten on turns 76,77,78,79\n> \n> - (2,5): value 1, life span 7 → turns 76 to 82\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 10 → turns 76 to 85\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,2), direction down. Moving down would go to (4,1), but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the border? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are playable, but y=0 and y=7 are walls. Similarly x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> So moving down from (4,2) to (4,1) should be possible, since y=1 is within bounds.\n> \n> (4,2) to down is (4,1), and y=1 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is the first row, which should be accessible, but it's a border cell? The input says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" meaning that cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So for movement, snake cannot go to those cells.\n> \n> Therefore, (4,1) has y=1, which is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be free, but let's list all wall cells.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls, but since it's a grid, the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (4,1): x=4, y=1, which is within 1 to 6, and not (5,2), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) to (6,1) are bottom row, not walls.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), moving down to (4,1) is possible.\n> \n> But let's see possible moves from (4,2) with direction down.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move up (opposite of down).\n> \n> So possible moves: down, left, right.\n> \n> Down: to (4,1)\n> \n> Left: to (3,2)\n> \n> Right: to (5,2), but (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So only possible moves: down to (4,1) or left to (3,2)\n> \n> Now, (4,1) is free?

Now, since the tail is at (1,2), and head moves to it, but the tail will move away only if no food eaten, but here there is food, so if eaten, tail should not move, but the cell is the same, so it might be that head and tail are on same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> The rule clarifies: \"the body moves away\" must happen before eating.\n> \n> So for food under body, including tail, it can only be eaten after the body moves away.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot directly move to a cell that has food under body; I need to wait for the body to move off that cell.\n> \n> For (1,2), it's the tail. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so (1,2) will be freed, and the new tail will be the previous segment.\n> \n> Current snake positions: indices: let's list with indices for clarity.\n> \n> Snake segments: 0: head (3,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: tail (1,2)\n> \n> So 17 segments?

Food is at T. If head moves to T to eat, then after move, head is at T, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the old tail is still at T, but head is now at T, so collision? Or the head moves to T, which was tail, but in the process, the tail segment is removed only if not eating, but when eating, the tail stays.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to food cell, it consumes food, and the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> But if the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then head and tail were on different cells, head moves to tail cell, which has food, so it eats, and the tail should not move, so the cell now has head, and the tail is still there? No, the tail segment is part of the body.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At a given state, the snake occupies cells, including tail at T.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell C:\n> \n> - If C has food, then head moves to C, food eaten, tail does not move, so the snake now has head at C, and all previous segments, including tail, so the tail is still at T, and a new segment will be added? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by keeping the tail and adding a new segment at the head, so the tail position remains the same.\n> \n> For example, snake segments: H, B1, B2, ..., T.\n> \n> If head moves to C with food, then new segments: C (new head), H, B1, B2, ..., T. So T is still tail, at the same position.\n> \n> If C was not T, no problem.\n> \n> But if C is T, and head moves to T, which has food, then after move, the new head is at T, and the previous head H is now a body segment, and T is still there, but T was the tail, now it's not tail anymore, but a body segment, and head is at T, so it's the same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> Yes, so moving head directly to the tail cell when it has food causes collision because both head and the body segment are on the same cell after the move.\n> \n> Therefore, for food on tail, you cannot eat it by moving directly to it; you must have the tail move away first, freeing the cell, then later head moves to it to eat when it's empty.\n> \n> Similarly for food on other body parts.\n> \n> Back to the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (1,2), I need the tail to move away first.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,2).

Let's see the positions.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,2), so new head position (2,2).\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is what was previously the second last segment, which is (1,3) in the list?

The head is at (2,2), and the direction is left (L), so it's moving left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 79, it's gone? Let me confirm the life span rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (1,2), life span 2 at turn 78: after this turn, life span becomes 1, and after turn 79, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 78 or 79.\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 5. So it will last until turn 82 (78 to 82 is 5 turns: 78,79,80,81,82; disappears after 82).\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 8. Lasts until turn 85.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, but I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,2), moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R. So possible actions: L, U, D.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> - Move L: to (1,2)\n> \n> - Move U: to (2,3)\n> \n> - Move D: to (2,1)\n> \n> But (2,1): y=1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 should be ok, but let's check if it's a wall. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,1) is not a wall, it's within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (2,1) is fine.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2) is directly left of head. If I move L to (1,2), I eat that food.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 79 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (2,5): value 1, life span 5, eat by turn 82.\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 8, eat by turn 85.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n> \n> The tail is (1,3), I think.

Let's count positions: 17 positions, so length 17.\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (2,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) is a food, but (1,4) is also a body segment? Positions: (1,4) is listed as a body segment, since (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) are part of snake.\n> \n> Snake positions include (1,4), and food is at (1,4). But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is a food, but (2,5) is also a body segment? Positions: (2,5) is in snake positions, yes, (2,5) is the 14th segment or something.\n> \n> List indices:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,2)\n> \n> 1: (3,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,2)\n> \n> 3: (4,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (6,3)\n> \n> 6: (6,4)\n> \n> 7: (6,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,5)\n> \n> 9: (5,6)\n> \n> 10: (4,6)\n> \n> 11: (3,6)\n> \n> 12: (3,5)\n> \n> 13: (2,5)\n> \n> 14: (1,5)\n> \n> 15: (1,4)\n> \n> 16: (1,3) tail\n> \n> So body segments include (2,5) at index 13, (1,4) at index 15.\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (2,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied by the snake at index 13, and (1,4) is occupied at index 15.\n> \n> So food at (2,5) and (1,4) are under the body.\n> \n> For food at (2,5): it's under the snake body at position (2,5), which is index 13.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,4) is under body at index 15.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is not occupied, I think. (1,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2) with direction L:\n> \n> - L to (1,2): that's where food is. If I move there, I eat the food, since it's not under body now? (1,2) is not occupied by body, so I can eat it directly.\n> \n> But let's see the tail reward danger.\n> \n> First, if I move to (1,2), I eat the food, snake grows to length 18, so new tail is added, but the tail was at (1,3), which moves to where? After moving, head is at (1,2), body segments shift: the old head (2,2) becomes body, so positions: new head (1,2), then (2,2), then (3,2), ..., up to tail (1,3) but since we ate food, a new segment is added at the tail position before moving, so tail stays at (1,3) for this move? Standard snake movement: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, and the segment before tail becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed from its position.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, new body segment is added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, and the new segment is attached, making the snake longer.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,2) and eat food, then new head is (1,2), the previous head (2,2) becomes body, and a new segment is added at the current tail position (1,3). So the tail remains at (1,3), and a new segment is there? No.\n> \n> After eating: the head moves to (1,2). The body segments from index 1 to 16 move to the positions of index 0 to 15, but since a new segment is added, the positions are: new head (1,2), then the old head (2,2) is now first body, then (3,2) is second body, ..., up to (1,4) is now index 15? Let's index.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), ..., 15: (1,4), 16: (1,3)\n> \n> After move left to (1,2) and eat: new head at (1,2). Then, the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> In movement, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the next segment moves to where head was, and so on, down to tail.\n> \n> But when eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So: head moves to (1,2). Then, the first body segment (index 1) moves to where head was, (2,2). Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,2). Index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (4,2). And so on, up to index 16 (tail) moves to where index 15 was, which is (1,4). But since we eat, a new segment is added at the current tail position before move, which is (1,3), so the new tail is at (1,3), and the segment that was tail is now at (1,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way:\n> \n> - Before move: positions: H (2,2), B1 (3,2), B2 (4,2), ..., B15 (1,4), B16 (1,3) tail.\n> \n> - Move head to new position, say (1,2) for left.\n> \n> - Since ate food, new segment added at old tail position (1,3).\n> \n> - Now, the body segments shift: B1 moves to H old position (2,2), B2 moves to B1 old position (3,2), ..., B15 moves to B14 old position? B14 is (1,5)? Let's list old positions:\n> \n> Old: H: (2,2), B1: (3,2), B2: (4,2), B3: (4,3), B4: (5,3), B5: (6,3), B6: (6,4), B7: (6,5), B8: (5,5), B9: (5,6), B10: (4,6), B11: (3,6), B12: (3,5), B13: (2,5), B14: (1,5), B15: (1,4), B16: (1,3)\n> \n> After move and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (1,2)\n> \n> - B1 moves to old H position: (2,2)\n> \n> - B2 moves to old B1 position: (3,2)\n> \n> - B3 moves to old B2 position: (4,2)\n> \n> - B4 moves to old B3 position: (4,3)\n> \n> - B5 moves to old B4 position: (5,3)\n> \n> - B6 moves to old B5 position: (6,3)\n> \n> - B7 moves to old B6 position: (6,4)\n> \n> - B8 moves to old B7 position: (6,5)\n> \n> - B9 moves to old B8 position: (5,5)\n> \n> - B10 moves to old B9 position: (5,6)\n> \n> - B11 moves to old B10 position: (4,6)\n> \n> - B12 moves to old B11 position: (3,6)\n> \n> - B13 moves to old B12 position: (3,5)\n> \n> - B14 moves to old B13 position: (2,5)\n> \n> - B15 moves to old B14 position: (1,5)\n> \n> - B16 moves to old B15 position: (1,4)\n> \n> - New segment at old B16 position: (1,3)\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), and new tail at (1,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (1,3), and (1,4) is now occupied.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is eaten, so it's gone.\n> \n> But there is food at (1,4) and (2,5), which are under body.\n> \n> Now, back to the move: if I move to (1,2), I eat the food, grow to 18.\n> \n> But is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, head at (1,2), tail at (1,3). Are they adjacent? (1,2) and (1,3) are vertically adjacent, so yes. And the tail cell (1,3) has food? Food is at (1,4), not (1,3). (1,3) is the tail position, but food is at (1,4), which is now a body segment.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n> \n> Here, tail cell is (1,3), and there is no food at (1,3); food is at (1,4), which is not the tail cell. So no danger from that.\n> \n> But (1,4) has food under it, but we're not eating it now.\n> \n> So moving to (1,2) seems safe and gets +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Other moves: I could move U or D.\n> \n> Move U to (2,3): is (2,3) free? Current positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ... (4,3) is a body segment, but (2,3) is not occupied, I think. Positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), so (2,3) is free? Let's see all positions: from list, (2,3) is not listed, so yes, free. Walls: no, so ok.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1): free, no wall or body.\n> \n> If I don't eat the food at (1,2), it will disappear soon.

And so on, up to index 16 (tail) moves to where index 15 was, which is (1,4).

Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, head at (1,2), tail at (1,3). Are they adjacent? (1,2) and (1,3) are vertically adjacent, so yes. And the tail cell (1,3) has food? Food is at (1,4), not (1,3). (1,3) is the tail position, but food is at (1,4), which is now a body segment.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n> \n> Here, tail cell is (1,3), and there is no food at (1,3); food is at (1,4), which is not the tail cell. So no danger from that.\n> \n> But (1,4) has food under it, but we're not eating it now.\n> \n> So moving to (1,2) seems safe and gets +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Other moves: I could move U or D.\n> \n> Move U to (2,3): is (2,3) free? Current positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ... (4,3) is a body segment, but (2,3) is not occupied, I think. Positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), so (2,3) is free? Let's see all positions: from list, (2,3) is not listed, so yes, free. Walls: no, so ok.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1): free, no wall or body.\n> \n> If I don't eat the food at (1,2), it will disappear soon. Life span 2, at turn 78, after this turn it becomes 1, so on turn 79, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, other food has longer life.\n> \n> But let's think about the food under body.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): it's under the body at (2,5), which is index 13.

After eating, positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), ..., (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n> \n> (1,3) is tail, so (1,3) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,3), that's where tail is. But moving to tail position is allowed because tail will move away. Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (1,3) is ok, but only if tail moves, which it does when not eating.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,3) on turn 79, I am moving to the tail position. Since tail is at (1,3), and I move there, but I don't eat food (no food at (1,3)), so no growth, tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to tail position and no food, it's ok because tail moves to previous position.\n> \n> Similarly, if food is there and I eat, but tail reward danger only if adjacent and eating tail cell food.\n> \n> But here no food at (1,3).\n> \n> So from (1,2), after eating:\n> \n> - Move U to (1,3): that's tail position. Since no food, snake doesn't grow, head moves to (1,3), tail moves to where it was going, which is (1,4) or something, but in this case, since we just ate, the body shifts.\n> \n> After turn 78: positions as above.\n> \n> Turn 79, if move U to (1,3):\n> \n> - Head to (1,3)\n> \n> - No food, so no growth.\n> \n> - Body segments shift: B1 (which is (2,2)) moves to old head (1,2)? Let's index new positions after turn 78.\n> \n> After turn 78 move L and eat:\n> \n> Positions: H: (1,2), B1: (2,2), B2: (3,2), B3: (4,2), B4: (4,3), B5: (5,3), B6: (6,3), B7: (6,4), B8: (6,5), B9: (5,5), B10: (5,6), B11: (4,6), B12: (3,6), B13: (3,5), B14: (2,5), B15: (1,5), B16: (1,4), B17: (1,3)  // since grew to 18\n> \n> Length 18, tail at (1,3)\n> \n> Now turn 79, move U to (1,3): but (1,3) is occupied by tail.

The short-life food at (2,5) is skipped due to high risk and timing constraints, prioritizing long-term survival and the safer (1,4) reward. Later moves (U to (1,5) and R to (2,5)) open space to avoid collisions and plan for the remaining food at (4,3).\n",

(3,5) is part of body, but it's tail, so moving to (3,5) is safe if no food there or if food, but since no food, it's safe.\n> \n> D to (3,3): (3,3) is body, first segment, occupied.\n> \n> L to (2,4): not in body, free.\n> \n> R to (4,4): not in body, free.\n> \n> So from (3,4) can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> But need to think further.\n> \n> First, let's consider the other option at turn 81.\n> \n> Back to turn 81, instead of R, move U to (2,4).\n> \n> From (2,3) move U to (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is free, no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> Head now at (2,4), direction U.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,4), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). Tail was (1,5), removed, so new tail at (2,5)?

So if move to (1,4), eat food, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n> \n> R to (3,4): free, no food.\n> \n> U to (2,5): (2,5) is tail, and has food? Food at (2,5), so if move to (2,5), eat food, but since it's tail, and we eat, tail doesn't move, so head and tail at same position after eat, but when eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the previous tail, but since head is on tail cell, after eating, the snake grows, so the position that was tail is now part of body, and head is there, so effectively, the head and the segment that was tail are on the same cell, but since tail was there and head moves in, it might be collision? Let's think.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, head at (2,4) is adjacent to tail at (2,5)? (2,4) and (2,5) are adjacent vertically, so yes, head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Tail cell (2,5) has positive food.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,5) to eat it, then according to rule, it kills the snake because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the head is on the cell where tail was, and since tail doesn't move, the new tail is the previous tail position, but head is there, so collision? The rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" Because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains where it was, and head moves to that cell, so they occupy same cell, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,5) to eat the food would cause death.\n> \n> So at (2,4), moving U to (2,5) is dangerous and fatal.\n> \n> Therefore, cannot move U from (2,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n> \n> D is invalid as above.\n> \n> So from (2,4), can go L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n> \n> If go L to (1,4), eat food there, since (1,4) has food. Value +1, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), new body: the previous positions with head added, tail not removed. So new head (1,4), then previous head (2,4), then rest of body except tail stays: previous positions before move: head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) tail.\n> \n> After eating at (1,4), new positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). Tail is still (2,5), but since grown, it's part of body, and the new tail is (2,5)? No, the tail segment is (2,5), but it's not removed, so the snake is longer.\n> \n> Length increases by one, so positions: head (1,4), then segments: (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), ..., up to (2,5), which is the last segment, tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Direction: moved L, so new direction L.\n> \n> From here, it might be messy, but let's compare options.\n> \n> First, back to turn 81 decision.\n> \n> At turn 81, if I move R to (3,3), then at turn 82 must move U to (3,4), as we saw.\n> \n> Then at turn 82, head at (3,4), can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n> \n> (3,5) is tail at that point, and no food, so moving to (3,5) is safe.\n> \n> But let's see food at (2,5), life span 2.\n> \n> At turn 81, if move R to (3,3), no eat.\n> \n> Turn 82 move U to (3,4), no eat.\n> \n> Then at turn 83, from (3,4), if I want to eat (2,5), I could move L to (2,4), then from there to (2,5), but (2,5) has food, and at that time, is it tail?\n> \n> Let's simulate times.\n> \n> Turn 81: move R to (3,3), head at (3,3), no eat, tail (1,5) removed, new tail at (2,5).

Moving U would go to (2,5). But (2,5) is currently occupied by the tail of the snake. The snake positions end with (2,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> According to the rules, moving into the tail is usually safe because the tail moves forward when the snake moves, so the head can occupy the previous tail position without colliding, as long as it's not growing.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the head collides with the new tail.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (2,4), and the tail is at (2,5). Are they adjacent? (2,4) and (2,5) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Yes, they are adjacent. And the tail cell (2,5) has food with value 1 and life span 1. So if the snake moves to (2,5) to eat the food, it would be eating from the tail position.\n> \n> But according to the rule, since the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, eating it would cause a collision because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the head is on (2,5), which is now the new tail or part of the body? Let's think.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it eats food, it grows by not removing the tail. So normally, when moving to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed. If food is eaten, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Here, if head moves to (2,5), which has food, it eats it. But (2,5) is currently the tail position. After eating, the snake grows, so the new segments are: head moves to (2,5), but (2,5) was tail, so it becomes part of the body, and since we ate food, we don't remove the tail, so the tail stays at (2,5)? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify the positions.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list from head to tail: (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> So head: (2,4), tail: (2,5)\n> \n> If we move up to (2,5), that cell has food, so we eat it. When we eat, the snake grows: so the head moves to (2,5), which is now the new head position, and since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so the tail remains where it was, but the tail was at (2,5), which is now occupied by the head? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - When snake moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, snake grows: head moves to new cell, body follows, tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail is removed, length same.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,5): (2,5) has food, so we eat it, grow: head moves to (2,5), and the tail is not removed. But the tail was at (2,5), which is the same cell? Positions: before move, tail is at (2,5). After move: head moves to (2,5), which is the food cell, and since we eat, we keep the tail, but the tail was at (2,5), so now we have two segments at (2,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> The positions are a list. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So, for example, if head moves from current head position to new position, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the last position (tail) is removed from the list, so the new tail is the second last segment.\n> \n> If food eaten, the last position is not removed, so the tail stays, and we add the new head position, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (2,5). If head moves to (2,5), and eats food, then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 1 (which was head) moves to (2,4) — old head position\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, which is (2,3)\n> \n> And so on, all the way to segment 17 moves to old segment 16 position, which was (3,5), and segment 18 (tail) was at (2,5), but since we ate food, we don't remove it, so the new tail is still at (2,5)? No.\n> \n> The position list is updated as:\n> \n> - New positions: head at new cell, then the old head, then the old segment 1, ..., up to old tail.\n> \n> Since we ate food, we keep all segments, so the new list is: [new head, old head, old seg1, ..., old tail]\n> \n> But in this case, new head is (2,5), old head is (2,4), old seg1 is (2,3), ..., old tail is (2,5). But (2,5) is the same as new head? That would mean (2,5) is listed twice, which is a collision.\n> \n> Ah, that's the problem. When the head moves to the tail cell to eat food, since the tail was at that cell, after movement, the new head is at (2,5), and the old tail is still at (2,5) in the list, but since it's the same cell, it's a collision.\n> \n> Moreover, the \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically warns about this: if head moves to tail cell with food, it causes collision because head and tail occupy the same cell after growth.\n> \n> So in this case, moving to (2,5) to eat the food would kill the snake immediately because of collision with itself.\n> \n> Therefore, I must avoid moving to (2,5) this turn.\n> \n> The head is currently at (2,4), direction U. Moving U to (2,5) is dangerous and fatal.\n> \n> What are the other possible moves?\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.

It's turn 83, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake is quite long, with 19 segments: positions from (1,4) to (2,5). The head is at (1,4) and it's moving left, so the current direction is L.\n> \n> Now, food positions: there are two pieces of food listed:\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> But both have value 1, so they're both positive food. The notation says (x, y, life_span, value), so for (4,3), it's value 1, life span 7; for (4,2), value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> I should plot this grid to visualize. Let me sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). That's 19 positions.\n> \n> Head direction is left, meaning it moved to (1,4) from the previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and it was moving left, so from (2,4) to (1,4), so current head at (1,4), direction L.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) and (4,2). But (4,3) is occupied by the snake? Let's see: snake positions include (4,3), which is the 10th segment? Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (1,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (2,3)\n> \n> 3: (1,3)\n> \n> 4: (1,2)\n> \n> 5: (2,2)\n> \n> 6: (3,2)\n> \n> 7: (4,2)\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: (5,3)\n> \n> 10: (6,3)\n> \n> 11: (6,4)\n> \n> 12: (6,5)\n> \n> 13: (5,5)\n> \n> 14: (5,6)\n> \n> 15: (4,6)\n> \n> 16: (3,6)\n> \n> 17: (3,5)\n> \n> 18: (2,5) tail\n> \n> So, (4,3) is position index 8, which is part of the body. Similarly, (4,2) is index 7, also body.\n> \n> But food is at (4,3) and (4,2), which are currently occupied by the snake. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (4,3), it's currently occupied, so the snake needs to move such that the segment at (4,3) moves away, and then later the head can move there to eat it. But since the snake moves one step at a time, when the snake moves, the tail might move, freeing up cells.\n> \n> Also, life span: for (4,3), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including this turn, so it has 7 turns left starting from turn 83? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 83, life span 7 means it will disappear after turn 89? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown to N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown to N-2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1, countdown to 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, N=1 at turn t: it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> N=2: exists on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 83:\n> \n> - Food at (4,3): life span 7, so it exists until turn 83 + 7 - 1 = 89? Turn t to t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 83: L=7, so after turn 83, L=6; after turn 84, L=5; ... after turn 89, L=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 83 to turn 89 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 9, exists until turn 83 + 9 - 1 = 91? Turn 83 to 92-1=91? Let's calculate:\n> \n> Start turn 83: L=9\n> \n> After turn 83: L=8\n> \n> After turn 84: L=7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 91: L=0, disappears. So exists from turn 83 to 91 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, both foods are under snake body: (4,3) at index 8, (4,2) at index 7.\n> \n> To eat them, the snake needs to move so that these cells are vacated and then head moves there.\n> \n> But also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), and it has food? But food is at (4,3) and (4,2), not at tail. Tail is at (2,5), no food there mentioned. So that might not be an issue now.\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves.\n> \n> Current head at (1,4), direction L, so last move was left to (1,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse. Current direction L, so cannot move right (opposite), so possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,5)\n> \n> - Down: (1,3)\n> \n> - Left: (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,4) but that's the body, and also cannot move opposite, but right is opposite to left, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move right. Also, (2,4) is the second segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), or L to (0,4) but (0,4) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> L to (0,4) is invalid because x=0 wall.\n> \n> U to (1,5): is that free? (1,5) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), etc. (1,5) not listed, so should be free? But walls: y=7 and y=0, so (1,5) is within bounds.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (1,3): (1,3) is the fourth segment?

But life span is given as 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this one? Let me see the input: it says \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for (4,3), life_span=6, so it will disappear after turn 84+6=90? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 84, life_span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. So after turn 84, it will have 5 turns left, and so on, disappearing when countdown reaches 0. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> The food is listed as (x,y, life_span, value).

Snake has (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), etc., (2,5) is not in positions, so it's empty.\n> \n> Let me map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (1,5)\n> \n> Then: (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So the snake body occupies these cells.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,2), both under body segments.\n> \n> (4,3) is segment index 9, (4,2) is index 8.\n> \n> Life span: (4,3) has life span 6, so at turn 84, it has 6 turns left, meaning it disappears at turn 90 if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has life span 8, disappears at turn 92.\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so from (1,5), moving Up would go to (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is within bounds? y from 0 to 7, y=7 wall, so y=6 ok. Is (1,6) occupied? Snake positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), no (1,6), and tail at (3,5), etc. (1,6) not listed, so empty? But let's list all occupied cells: from positions: (1,5),(1,4),(2,4),(2,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(5,5),(5,6),(4,6),(3,6),(3,5). So (1,6) is not occupied, and not wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is there food? Food at (4,3) and (4,2), not at (1,6).\n> \n> Similarly, other moves: Down from (1,5) would be to (1,4), but (1,4) is the second segment, so body collision, deadly. Cannot move Down.\n> \n> Left to (0,5), but x=0 is wall, so wall collision, deadly.\n> \n> Right to (2,5), which is not occupied, I think. (2,5) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so possible moves: U, D, L, R, but D is into body, L is wall, so only U and R are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is U, cannot move D next turn, but D is already invalid, so not an issue.\n> \n> Now, food: both foods are under body, so need to free them up to eat.\n> \n> First, (4,3) has shorter life span, only 6 turns left, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has 8 turns.\n> \n> But to eat them, the body must move away.\n> \n> Currently, (4,3) is occupied by segment 9, (4,2) by segment 8.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves, the tail will move, so cells might be freed.\n> \n> But food under body can only be eaten if head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> So I need to plan a path to reach (4,3) or (4,2) after they are free.\n> \n> But they might not be free immediately.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (3,5), which is near head.\n> \n> Head at (1,5), tail at (3,5), so they are close.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> Let's consider both options.\n> \n> First, move Up to (1,6).\n> \n> Then head at (1,6). Direction now U.\n> \n> Possible next moves: from (1,6), can move U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now the second segment? After moving to (1,6), the new positions: head at (1,6), then the previous head (1,5) becomes first body, so positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), ...] so (1,5) is body, so moving D to (1,5) would be body collision, deadly. L to (0,6) wall. R to (2,6), which might be free? (2,6) not in current positions, and not wall, so possibly free.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; we need a sequence.\n> \n> Similarly, if move Right to (2,5), head to (2,5), direction now R.\n> \n> Then from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is now body segment, since head moved to (2,5), so positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), etc. So (1,5) is body, so moving L to (1,5) body collision. Moving D to (2,4): (2,4) is segment 2? Original positions: after move to (2,5), segments: head (2,5), then previous head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), but (2,4) is now the third segment? Let's index: after move to (2,5), the snake is [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] and tail at (3,6)? Original tail was (3,5), but when head moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten, but no food eaten yet, so tail moves, but since no food, length same, tail segment is removed.\n> \n> General snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> So from current positions, if move to (2,5), new head (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and tail was (3,5), but since tail moves, (3,5) is removed, so the new tail is (3,6)? Positions: after move, the segments are from index 0 to 18, but when head moves to new position, the last position is removed if no food.\n> \n> Current positions: 19 segments.\n> \n> Move to (2,5): new head at (2,5), then the first body is previous head (1,5), then the rest up to the second last, so segments 1 to 18 of current become body, but index 1 is (1,4), etc.\n> \n> Better to think: new positions: head at new cell, then the previous positions except the last one is removed.\n> \n> So current positions: [ (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] 19 cells.\n> \n> After moving to (2,5), new head at (2,5), then the body is the first 18 of the current positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So 18 segments, tail at (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (1,6), new head (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and (3,5) removed, so tail at (3,6).\n> \n> In both cases, tail moves to (3,6).\n> \n> Now back to food.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,2) are under body, so they are there, but cannot be eaten yet.\n> \n> To eat (4,3), which is currently occupied, it needs to be free, then head move there.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2).\n> \n> Also, life span: (4,3) has 6 turns left, so it will disappear at turn 90 if not eaten. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 84, life span 6, so after turn 84, it has 5 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn 84, food has life span N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,3), at turn 84, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 84,85,86,87,88,89; at turn 90 it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 8, can be eaten turns 84 to 91, disappears turn 92.\n> \n> But since it's under body, it can't be eaten until the body moves away.\n> \n> Now, the body at (4,3) is segment 9, which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> But to free the cell, the snake needs to move so that this segment is no longer there.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2).\n> \n> I should simulate a few moves to see when these cells might be free.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Up to (1,6)\n> \n> Then head at (1,6), direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, invalid; D to (1,5) body, invalid; L to (0,6) wall, invalid; R to (2,6) , which is free, so only R possible? But direction is U, so for next turn, can move U, D, L, R, but U and L and D invalid, so must move R to (2,6).\n> \n> Then from (2,6), direction now R? Moved R, so direction right.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), can move U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is now body, since head moved to (2,6), so (1,6) is first body segment. So moving L to (1,6) body collision. (2,5) : what is at (2,5)? After first move to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), ..., up to (3,6), tail at (3,6) as before.\n> \n> Then move R to (2,6), new head (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) but (3,6) was tail, removed? After first move to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — 19 segments? When moving to (1,6), new head, remove tail (3,5), so positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — that's 19, but tail should be removed, so 18 segments? Let's count: from head to tail: 1. (1,6), 2. (1,5), 3. (1,4), 4. (2,4), 5. (2,3), 6. (1,3), 7. (1,2), 8. (2,2), 9. (3,2), 10. (4,2), 11. (4,3), 12. (5,3), 13. (6,3), 14. (6,4), 15. (6,5), 16. (5,5), 17. (5,6), 18. (4,6), 19. (3,6). 19 positions, but when moving without eating, the snake length remains the same, so when head moves to new cell, the tail cell is removed, so the number of segments should be the same.\n> \n> Initial: 19 segments.\n> \n> After move to (1,6): new head (1,6), then the previous head and body except the last one, so segments 0 to 17: (1,5) to (3,6) but segment 17 is (4,6), segment 18 is (3,6)? Current positions index: 0:(1,5), 1:(1,4), 2:(2,4), 3:(2,3), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,2), 6:(2,2), 7:(3,2), 8:(4,2), 9:(4,3), 10:(5,3), 11:(6,3), 12:(6,4), 13:(6,5), 14:(5,5), 15:(5,6), 16:(4,6), 17:(3,6), 18:(3,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (1,6), new positions: head (1,6), then the first 18 body segments from current: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So 19 segments? Head + 18 body, but when no food, length same, but the tail is removed, so it should be head + the first 18 segments of the previous snake, which includes the previous head to the second last tail.\n> \n> Previous snake: 19 segments, after move, new head, and the body is segments 0 to 17 of previous, which are 18 segments, so total 19 segments.

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step-by-step to determine the best immediate action.\n\n### Current State (Turn 85):\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (2,5), direction R (right), body segments follow.\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): Value +1, life span 5.\n  - (4,2): Value +1, life span 7.\n  - (2,4): Value +1, life span 10.\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Cannot reverse direction (no L since current direction is R).\n  - Must avoid collisions with walls, body (except tail), and obstacles.\n\n### Possible Moves from (2,5), Direction R:\n1. **U (Up)**: (2,6)\n   - (2,6) is free (not wall or body).\n2. **D (Down)**: (2,4)\n   - (2,4) is occupied by body (segment 3), so invalid.\n3. **L (Left)**: (1,5)\n   - (1,5) is occupied by body (segment 1), so invalid.\n4. **R (Right)**: (3,5)\n   - (3,5) is free (not wall or body).\n\nThus, valid immediate moves: **U or R**.\n\n### Food Accessibility:\n- All food is currently under the snake's body:\n  - (2,4): Occupied by segment 3.\n  - (4,3): Occupied by segment 10.\n  - (4,2): Occupied by segment 9.\n- To eat food under the body:\n  1. The body must move away from the food cell.\n  2. The head must then move onto the freed food cell.\n- Given the snake's length (19 segments), it will take many moves for the segments covering the food to become the tail and free the cells. The food's life spans are too short for this (especially (4,3) with life span 5). Thus, **we cannot eat any food in time**.\n\n### Survival Strategy:\nSince we cannot eat the food, we must prioritize survival by moving to open spaces and avoiding dead ends. \n\n#### Option 1: Move R to (3,5)\n- From (3,5), possible next moves:\n  - U to (3,6): Free.\n  - D to (3,4): Free.\n  - R to (4,5): Free.\n- This opens up more options for future moves and avoids immediate dead ends.\n\n#### Option 2: Move U to (2,6)\n- From (2,6), possible next moves:\n  - L to (1,6): Free, but leads to a dead end (no further moves from (1,6)).\n  - R to (3,6): Free, but may also lead to limited options.\n- This path is riskier as it may trap the snake sooner.\n\n### Decision:\n**Move R to (3,5)** is safer because it provides more flexibility for future moves and avoids immediate dead ends. \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 85, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the snake can only move within x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and direction is R (right). So the snake is moving right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span), countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 85, if life span is 5, it will disappear on turn 90? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life span is L, it means it will disappear after L more turns. For example, at turn 85, life span 5, it will disappear at the start of turn 86? No.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that after N turns from now, it disappears. And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, the life span decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, the food disappears before the snake moves.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". But it doesn't specify when it decreases relative to the turn.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that for food with life span L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears? I need a standard.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is given at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think for simplicity, at turn t, if life span is L, it means it has L turns left, including the current turn. So after L turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn 85, life span 5, it will disappear after turn 89, so it's not there on turn 90.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 10 at turn 85 disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> Also, for (4,3), life span 5 at turn 85, so it disappears after turn 89? Turn 85 + 5 - 1 = 89, I think.\n> \n> Let's define: if at turn t, life span is L, then it will disappear at the start of turn t + L. Meaning it is not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, on turn t, L decreases to L-1 at the end of turn, and when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says countdown decreases every turn including current, which might mean at the beginning of turn, it decreases.\n> \n> To be consistent, I'll assume that at the start of each turn, before the snake moves, the life span of each food decreases by 1. If it reaches 0, the food is removed before the snake acts for that turn.\n> \n> But for the current state, we have the food at turn 85 with life spans.\n> \n> For planning, I need to know when food disappears.\n> \n> For (4,3): life span 5 at turn 85. After turn 85, life span becomes 4 for turn 86, and so on. After 5 turns, on turn 90, it would have life span 0 and disappear before turn 90 actions or after?\n> \n> Let's not overcomplicate. Since the countdown decreases every turn including current, for the purpose of this turn, we can consider the life span as the number of turns it will remain, including this one.\n> \n> So for (4,3), at turn 85, it has 5 turns left: it can be eaten on turns 85,86,87,88,89.

The immediate goal is to avoid collisions and dead ends. \n\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **U (to (3,6))**: Valid and open. \n   - **D (to (3,4))**: Valid and open. \n   - **R (to (4,5))**: Valid and open. \n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **R (to (4,5))** is the safest choice because:\n  - It continues the current rightward direction, avoiding sharp turns that might box the snake in. \n  - It moves the snake toward the center of the grid, where there are more open spaces to maneuver. \n  - It avoids immediate collisions and dead ends. \n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 85, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the snake can only move within x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and direction is R (right). So the snake is moving right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span), countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 85, if life span is 5, it will disappear on turn 90? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life span is L, it means it will disappear after L more turns. For example, at turn 85, life span 5, it will disappear at the start of turn 86? No.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that after N turns from now, it disappears. And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, the life span decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, the food disappears before the snake moves.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". But it doesn't specify when it decreases relative to the turn.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that for food with life span L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears? I need a standard.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is given at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think for simplicity, at turn t, if life span is L, it means it has L turns left, including the current turn. So after L turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn 85, life span 5, it will disappear after turn 89, so it's not there on turn 90.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 10 at turn 85 disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> Also, for (4,3), life span 5 at turn 85, so it disappears after turn 89? Turn 85 + 5 - 1 = 89, I think.\n> \n> Let's define: if at turn t, life span is L, then it will disappear at the start of turn t + L. Meaning it is not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, on turn t, L decreases to L-1 at the end of turn, and when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says countdown decreases every turn including current, which might mean at the beginning of turn, it decreases.\n> \n> To be consistent, I'll assume that at the start of each turn, before the snake moves, the life span of each food decreases by 1. If it reaches 0, the food is removed before the snake acts for that turn.\n> \n> But for the current state, we have the food at turn 85 with life spans.\n> \n> For planning, I need to know when food disappears.\n> \n> For (4,3): life span 5 at turn 85. After turn 85, life span becomes 4 for turn 86, and so on. After 5 turns, on turn 90, it would have life span 0 and disappear before turn 90 actions or after?\n> \n> Let's not overcomplicate. Since the countdown decreases every turn including current, for the purpose of this turn, we can consider the life span as the number of turns it will remain, including this one.\n> \n> So for (4,3), at turn 85, it has 5 turns left: it can be eaten on turns 85,86,87,88,89. On turn 90, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 7: can be eaten on turns 85 to 91.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 10: turns 85 to 94.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (2,5), moving right. Body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> List the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,5)\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (1,4)\n> \n> 3: (2,4)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (1,3)\n> \n> 6: (1,2)\n> \n> 7: (2,2)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,2) — this is a food position? (4,2) has food with value 1.\n> \n> 10: (4,3) — also food at (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (5,3)\n> \n> 12: (6,3)\n> \n> 13: (6,4)\n> \n> 14: (6,5)\n> \n> 15: (5,5)\n> \n> 16: (5,6)\n> \n> 17: (4,6)\n> \n> 18: (3,6)\n> \n> The snake has 19 segments.\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (4,3) : but this is occupied by the snake's body at index 10. Position (4,3) is part of the snake, segment 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is segment 9.\n> \n> And (2,4) is segment 3.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body, as per rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (4,3), food is there, but it's currently occupied by the snake's body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,3), and then the head moves to (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2) and (2,4).\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, I need to find where the tail is.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), tail is the last one, (3,6).\n> \n> Tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Head is at (2,5), which is adjacent to? (2,5) neighbors: up (2,6), down (2,4), left (1,5), right (3,5).\n> \n> (3,6) is down-right or something? (2,5) to (3,6) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so same x or y differing by 1.\n> \n> (2,5) and (3,6) differ in both x and y, so not adjacent. Distance is sqrt(2), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells are U, D, L, R, so (x±1,y) or (x,y±1).\n> \n> So head (2,5) has neighbors: U: (2,6), D: (2,4), L: (1,5), R: (3,5)\n> \n> Tail is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to head; (3,6) neighbors are (3,5), (3,7), (2,6), (4,6). (3,7) is y=7, wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now, the food at (2,4) is occupied by segment 3 of the snake. Similarly, (4,3) by segment 10, (4,2) by segment 9.\n> \n> To eat these, we need the body to move away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each turn the body segments shift.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves right from (2,5) to (3,5), then the new head is (3,5), and the body: segment 1 moves to old head (2,5), segment 2 to (1,5), and so on, down to tail: the current tail (3,6) will move to the position of the second last segment, which is (4,6), so tail leaves (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, for a body segment, when the snake moves, each segment except head moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, so the position that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if that segment moves and nothing else moves into it immediately, but since all segments shift, the cell that was tail is abandoned, and cells that were body might be occupied by the next segment moving in.\n> \n> But for a food under a body segment, it can be eaten only if that body segment moves away and then head moves in later.\n> \n> Specifically, the rule: \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So it requires two things: first, the snake moves such that the cell is no longer occupied, then on a subsequent move, head moves there.\n> \n> For example, for (4,3), which is currently occupied by segment 10. When the snake moves, segment 10 will move to where segment 9 was? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: segment 9: (4,2), segment 10: (4,3), segment 11: (5,3)\n> \n> After one move, depending on direction.\n> \n> But segment 10 is at (4,3), which has food.\n> \n> If the snake moves in a way that segment 10 leaves (4,3), then (4,3) becomes empty, and then later head can move to (4,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Also, we have to avoid collisions: walls, body, except the tail cell is ok if we move into it because tail moves.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating that food causes death because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,6), with no food, I think. Food is at (2,4), (4,3), (4,2), none at tail.\n> \n> (3,6) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. Think 5+ turns, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at borders and (5,2) obstacle.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is wall, so avoid that.\n> \n> (5,2) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, possible moves are U, D, R, but not L, because no instant reverse. Current direction R, so cannot move L (left), opposite.\n> \n> So can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the neighbors:\n> \n> - U: (2,6) — is this valid? y=6, which is within 1-6? y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=2, y=6.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> From positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Also, (5,2) is wall, not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Now, (2,6): is it in this list? No, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> But (2,6) is above head, U.\n> \n> D: (2,4) — but (2,4) is occupied by segment 3, so body collision if move there.\n> \n> L: (1,5) — occupied by segment 1, body collision.\n> \n> R: (3,5) — is it occupied? Look at positions: (3,5) not in list, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but occupied, invalid, L to (1,5) occupied, invalid, R to (3,5) free, valid.\n> \n> Also, since direction is R, we can move U or D or R, but D and L are invalid, so only U and R are possible? D is to (2,4) which is occupied, so not possible. L is to (1,5) occupied, not possible. So only U or R can be considered.\n> \n> But U to (2,6) is free, R to (3,5) is free.\n> \n> So for turn 85, actions: U or R.\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food to consider:\n> \n> - (2,4) is occupied, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> - (4,3) occupied, life span 5, so must be eaten within 5 turns or lost.\n> \n> - (4,2) occupied, life span 7, 7 turns.\n> \n> Since (4,3) has shorter life, it might be a priority if we can get to it soon.\n> \n> But to eat (4,3), we need to free the cell first.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> First, let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current head (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> If we move R to (3,5), new head (3,5), then body: segment 1 moves to (2,5), segment 2 to (1,5), ..., segment 18 moves to (4,6), and tail segment 19 (3,6) moves to where segment 18 was, (4,6)? Positions: segment 17 is (4,6), segment 18 is (3,6), so after move, segment 19 (tail) moves to position of segment 18, which is (3,6) but segment 18 is (3,6), no.\n> \n> The positions shift: new position 0: (3,5) if we move right.\n> \n> Then position 1: old head (2,5)\n> \n> Position 2: old pos 1 (1,5)\n> \n> Position 3: old pos 2 (1,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position 10: old pos 9 (4,2)?

It's turn 87, and I'm the snake. My head is at (4,5), and I'm moving right (R). The snake positions are a list from head to tail: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6)]. That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 87, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 89? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N. Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span N: available for N more turns.\n> \n> - After turn t, life span N-1 for turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> - Disappears when life span reaches 0, I think. But the problem says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now.\n> \n> For (4,3): life span 3 at turn 87, so it will disappear after turn 87 + 3 = turn 90? But countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn 87: life span 3 (available)\n> \n> - Turn 88: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 89: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 90: life span 0, disappears? Or after turn 89?\n> \n> The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t. But let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think it means that at the beginning of the turn, we have the life span, and after the snake moves, if the food is not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If life span was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But the food can be eaten during the turn, so:\n> \n> - At the start of turn, food has life span S.\n> \n> - Snake moves: if head moves to food cell, it's eaten.\n> \n> - If not eaten, after the move, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> - If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (4,3) at turn 87, life span 3: it can be eaten on turns 87, 88, or 89. After turn 89, if not eaten, it disappears before turn 90.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 3: disappears after turn 89.\n> \n> (4,2) life span 5: disappears after turn 91 (87+4? Turn 87: L=5, after turn 87 L=4, ..., after turn 91 L=0? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Start turn 87: L=3 for (4,3)\n> \n> - After turn 87: if not eaten, L=2\n> \n> - After turn 88: L=1\n> \n> - After turn 89: L=0, disappears.

Last eat on turn 91.\n> \n> (2,4) L=8: disappears after turn 94, last eat on turn 94.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), direction R. So moving right, to (5,5) or something? Current position: head (4,5), next is (3,5), so body segments.\n> \n> From positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6).\n> \n> Tail is (5,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), moving right. Since direction is R, from (4,5), moving right would go to (5,5). But (5,5) is occupied by the body? Let's see the positions: (5,5) is the 18th segment? List index: 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,4), 16: (6,5), 17: (5,5), 18: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (5,5) is the 17th segment, which is part of the body. But when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> If head moves to (5,5), which is currently occupied by the body, but since the snake moves, that cell will be vacated by the tail moving, but when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves, but here (5,5) is not the tail; tail is (5,6). (5,5) is a body segment, so moving head to (5,5) would cause collision because after moving, head is at (5,5), and the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where? Let's think how snake movement works.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is not food, tail moves forward, so the cell where tail was is free. If head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it dies, unless it's the tail cell just as tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from positions, (5,5) is occupied by a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (5,6). So if head moves to (5,5), it would be moving onto a body segment, causing collision and death.\n> \n> But let's confirm the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is not the tail; tail is (5,6). So (5,5) is a body segment, so moving to (5,5) should cause collision.\n> \n> Also, direction: current head direction is R, so from (4,5), moving right to (5,5) is possible, but (5,5) is occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions: up to (4,6), down to (4,4), left to (3,5), but left to (3,5) is the next body segment, so also collision.\n> \n> Available moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) - is this within bounds? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So y=7 is wall, (4,6): y=6, which is less than 7, so y=6 is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (4,6): x=4, y=6. Since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall, unless specified. Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so they are not playable. Therefore, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (4,6) has y=6, which is within 1 to 6, so it's playable, unless it's a wall, but walls are only the borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacle is (5,2), so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) y=4, free.\n> \n> (5,5) x=5,y=5, but occupied by body.\n> \n> (3,5) occupied by body.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,6) - is it free? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n> \n> So occupied: all these cells.\n> \n> (4,6) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) not in list, free.\n> \n> (5,5) is in list, occupied.\n> \n> (3,5) is in list, occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: (5,2) is obstacle, but not relevant for (4,5) moves.\n> \n> So from (4,5), head direction R, but since we choose action, we can change direction, but with no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move left (L) immediately, because left is opposite of right.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U and D, L and R.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R. Cannot L.\n> \n> Now, moving R to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body, so if I move there, collision.\n> \n> Moving U to (4,6): (4,6) not occupied, so possible.\n> \n> Moving D to (4,4): (4,4) not occupied, possible.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,3), (4,2), (2,4).\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by the snake body! Look at positions: (4,3) is the 12th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,3), 13: (5,3), etc.\n> \n> So (4,3) is index 12, which is part of the body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is index 11, body segment.\n> \n> (2,4) is index 5, body segment.\n> \n> All food is currently under the snake body!\n> \n> But the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for each food:\n> \n> - (4,3) at position (4,3), which is currently occupied by body segment. To eat it, the snake must move so that this cell is vacated, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2) and (2,4).\n> \n> Life spans: (4,3) L=3, so must be eaten by turn 89 (since after turn 89 it disappears).\n> \n> Turn 87: L=3, after turn 87 L=2, after turn 88 L=1, after turn 89 L=0 disappear. So can be eaten on turn 87,88,89.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) L=5, can be eaten turns 87 to 91.\n> \n> (2,4) L=8, turns 87 to 94.\n> \n> But since they are under body, need to move body away first.\n> \n> Now, current turn 87, head at (4,5), direction R.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for turns 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, etc., at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, maximize score, but avoid risks. Prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, what can I do on turn 87.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5) but (5,5) occupied, so invalid, would die. So only U or D.\n> \n> Cannot L because of no instant reverse, and current direction R.\n> \n> So actions for turn 87: U or D.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,6): then head to (4,6), body follows. The segment at tail (5,6) moves to where? After move, head is at (4,6), then the body: previous head was (4,5), now becomes segment 1, and so on, tail (5,6) is removed if not growing, but since no food eaten, tail moves away from (5,6).\n> \n> After moving to (4,6), snake positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — and tail was (5,6), but since no growth, tail moves off (5,6), so the last segment (5,6) is removed, and the new tail is what was (5,5)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(3,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(1,5), 4:(1,4), 5:(2,4), 6:(2,3), 7:(1,3), 8:(1,2), 9:(2,2), 10:(3,2), 11:(4,2), 12:(4,3), 13:(5,3), 14:(6,3), 15:(6,4), 16:(6,5), 17:(5,5), 18:(5,6)\n> \n> After moving U to (4,6): new head is (4,6), then the body is the previous positions from 0 to 17, but without the last one? When snake moves, if no food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, etc., and the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (4,6)\n> \n> Then segment 1: at previous head position (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: at previous segment 1 position (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3: at (2,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 18: at previous segment 17 position (5,5)\n> \n> Previous segment 17 is (5,5), which was index 17.\n> \n> After move, the new snake has head at new position, then the first body segment at old head position, second body at old first body position, ..., and the last body segment at the position of the second last old segment, since the tail is removed.\n> \n> Old segments: 0 (head), 1,2,3,...,18 (tail)\n> \n> After move to new head position:\n> \n> New head: (4,6)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head (4,5)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 (3,5)\n> \n> New segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 18: old segment 17 (5,5)\n> \n> But old segment 17 was (5,5), so new tail is at (5,5), and old tail (5,6) is now free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (4,4), similar thing.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3), which is currently occupied by segment 12.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 7x7 (playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacle**: (5,2) is blocked.\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (4,6), moving Up (U).\n  - Body segments: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)].\n  - Length: 19 segments.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 89).\n  - (4,2): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 91).\n  - (2,4): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 94).\n  - (2,6): value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 97).\n\n### Immediate Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,6), moving Up (U) would go to (4,7), which is a wall — invalid.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so the opposite direction Down (D) is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\nThus, possible moves are Left (L) to (3,6) or Right (R) to (5,6).\n\n### Evaluating Move Left (L) to (3,6)\n\n1. **Move to (3,6)**:\n   - New head: (3,6).\n   - Body: [(4,6), (4,5), ..., (5,5)] (tail at (5,5) is removed since no food is eaten).\n   - Direction changes to L.\n\n2. **Next Move from (3,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (3,7) — wall.\n     - D: (3,5) — occupied by body segment (3,5).\n     - L: (2,6) — free and has food (2,6).\n     - R: (4,6) — occupied by body segment (4,6).\n   - Only possible move: L to (2,6).\n\n3. **Move to (2,6)**:\n   - Eat food at (2,6): length increases to 20, tail stays.\n   - New head: (2,6).\n   - Body: [(3,6), (4,6), ..., (5,5)].\n\n4. **Next Move from (2,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (2,7) — wall.\n     - D: (2,5) — occupied by body segment (2,5).\n     - L: (1,6) — free.\n     - R: (3,6) — occupied by body segment (3,6).\n   - Only possible move: L to (1,6).\n\n5. **Move to (1,6)**:\n   - No food eaten, tail is removed.\n   - New head: (1,6).\n   - Body: [(2,6), (3,6), ..., (5,5)].\n\n6. **Next Move from (1,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (1,7) — wall.\n     - D: (1,5) — occupied by body segment (1,5).\n     - L: (0,6) — wall.\n     - R: (2,6) — occupied by body segment (2,6).\n   - No valid moves — snake dies.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving L leads to death in 3 turns. Not a good option.\n\n### Evaluating Move Right (R) to (5,6)\n\n1. **Move to (5,6)**:\n   - New head: (5,6).\n   - Body: [(4,6), (4,5), ..., (5,5)] (tail at (5,5) is removed).\n   - Direction changes to R.\n\n2. **Next Move from (5,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (5,7) — wall.\n     - D: (5,5) — free (tail was just removed).\n     - L: (4,6) — occupied by body segment (4,6).\n     - R: (6,6) — free.\n   - Possible moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\n#### Option 1: Move D to (5,5)\n\n1. **Move to (5,5)**:\n   - No food eaten, tail is removed.\n   - New head: (5,5).\n   - Body: [(5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,4)].\n\n2. **Next Move from (5,5)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (5,6) — occupied by body segment (5,6).\n     - D: (5,4) — free.\n     - L: (4,5) — occupied by body segment (4,5).\n     - R: (6,5) — free.\n   - Possible moves: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nThis path seems safer, allowing more flexibility in future moves without immediate death.\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (6,6)\n\n1. **Move to (6,6)**:\n   - No food eaten, tail is removed.\n   - New head: (6,6).\n   - Body: [(5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,4)].\n\n2. **Next Move from (6,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (6,7) — wall.\n     - D: (6,5) — free.\n     - L: (5,6) — occupied by body segment (5,6).\n     - R: (7,6) — wall.\n   - Only possible move: D to (6,5).\n\nThis also seems safe but leads the snake towards the corner, which might limit future options.\n\n### Choosing the Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven that moving L leads to certain death, moving R is the only viable option. Between the two sub-options after moving R:\n\n- Moving D to (5,5) seems better as it keeps the snake more centered, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n- Moving R to (6,6) corners the snake, which might be risky in the long run.\n\nHowever, the immediate action is to move R to (5,6), and the subsequent moves can be decided based on the new state.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt turn 88, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5,6), avoiding the deadly path to the left.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after N-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, including t, so:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown L-2, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" – N is the initial life span.

Walls are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can be at x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n> \n> List of positions in order: index 0 is head, 1 is next, etc.\n> \n> - 0: (4,6) head\n> \n> - 1: (4,5)\n> \n> - 2: (3,5)\n> \n> - 3: (2,5)\n> \n> - 4: (1,5)\n> \n> - 5: (1,4)\n> \n> - 6: (2,4)\n> \n> - 7: (2,3)\n> \n> - 8: (1,3)\n> \n> - 9: (1,2)\n> \n> - 10: (2,2)\n> \n> - 11: (3,2)\n> \n> - 12: (4,2)\n> \n> - 13: (4,3)\n> \n> - 14: (5,3)\n> \n> - 15: (6,3)\n> \n> - 16: (6,4)\n> \n> - 17: (6,5)\n> \n> - 18: (5,5) tail\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,6), moving Up. Up means increasing y? In grid coordinates, usually y increases down or up? Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up? That might be counterintuitive.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, but here it says U (x,y+1), which might imply that y+1 is upward if we think of y=0 at bottom, but it says \"U (x,y+1)\" and walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's interpret.\n> \n> It says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> And walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. So probably, y=0 is bottom or top? Since U is y+1, likely y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so moving Up increases y towards top? But usually in programming, y=0 is top, y increases down.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"U (x,y+1)\", and walls at y=0 and y=7. If y=0 is bottom, then U to (x,y+1) moves up towards higher y. If y=0 is top, U to (x,y+1) would move down.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head at (4,6), and previous position is (4,5), and direction is U, so from (4,5) to (4,6) is U, so y increased from 5 to 6. Since walls at y=0 and y=7, y=7 must be the top or bottom?\n> \n> Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are boundaries. If y=6 is the highest y before wall, and head at (4,6), which is y=6, so it's at the top row if y=7 is wall. y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, with y=6 being the top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, with (1,1) bottom-left? Since y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? Let's see.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), which is near top, since y=6 is adjacent to y=7 wall.\n> \n> Moving U (up) to (x,y+1) but y+1 from 6 would be 7, which is wall, so it can't move up. Head at (4,6), direction U, but y=6, so U to (4,7) is wall, so it can't move up. But the direction is given as U, meaning it was moving up to get here, but now it's at (4,6), so it can't move U further.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6): U to (4,7) is wall, impossible. D to (4,5) but (4,5) is the second segment, the body. L to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, what is at (3,6) and (5,6)? From positions, (3,6) is not in snake, (5,6) not in snake. Snake positions: (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), etc., no (3,6) or (5,6), so both are free? But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,6) is x=3,y=6, which is within 1-6, not wall. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (5,2), which is not relevant here.

But food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,3): food is at (4,3) with life span 1, and snake has a segment at (4,3) which is the 15th segment? Let's index: position 0: head (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (4,3), 15: (5,3), 16: (6,3), 17: (6,4), 18: (6,5) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is index 14, and (4,2) is index 13. Both have food on them, but since the snake is on them, they can't be eaten immediately. The food will only be accessible if the snake moves away from those cells.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 89. Since turn 89 is current, if it's not eaten now, it vanishes. But since the snake is on it, and head is not on it, it can't be eaten this turn. So it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,2) has life span 3, so it might be available later if the snake moves.\n> \n> But let's confirm the life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So for food at (4,3), life span 1 on turn 89: after this turn, it disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn 89 if head is on it. But head is at (5,6), not on (4,3), so impossible to eat this turn.

The tail is at (6,4).\n\n**Food**:\n- (4,2): Value +1, Life span 3 (disappears after turn 92).\n- (2,4): Value +1, Life span 5 (disappears after turn 94).\n- (2,6): Value +1, Life span 8 (disappears after turn 97).\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6) is occupied by the body segment immediately behind the head. Moving here would cause a collision. Invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4) is free (not occupied by the snake or walls).\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5) is occupied by a body segment. Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5) is free (not occupied by the snake or walls).\n\n**Valid Moves**: D or R.\n\n### Decision for Turn \\( t_0 = 90 \\)\n\nFrom the previous plan at turn 89, the intended action sequence was:\n- Turn 89: D (already executed, head now at (5,5), direction D.\n- Turn 90: R (as per the plan).\n\nHowever, let's verify if moving R to (6,5) is safe and optimal:\n- (6,5) is free.\n- After moving R, the new head direction would be R (since we moved right from (5,5)).\n- On the next turn (turn 91), the possible moves from (6,5) would be U, D, or R (cannot move L opposite to R).\n  - U to (6,6): Free.\n  - D to (6,4): Occupied by the tail (6,4), but the tail will move away, so this is safe.\n  - R to (7,5): Wall (x=7), invalid.\n- Moving R now sets up a path where we can continue to navigate the right side safely.\n\nAlternative: Move D to (5,4):\n- (5,4) is free.\n- New head direction would be D.\n- On turn 91, from (5,4), possible moves:\n  - D to (5,3): Occupied by body segment (5,3). Invalid.\n  - L to (4,4): Free.\n  - R to (6,4): Occupied by tail (6,4), safe.\n- This path might lead to more constrained options later.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving R to (6,5) is safer and aligns with the previous plan to navigate toward the right side where there is more space.\n\n### Updated Action Sequence\n\nGiven that the previous plan was to move R on turn 90, and this move is safe and optimal, we will proceed with:\n\n\\boxed{R} \n\n### Next Steps (for context):\n\nFollowing this move:\n- Turn 90: R to (6,5).\n- Turn 91: From (6,5), move D to (6,4) (tail cell, safe).\n- Turn 92: From (6,4), move L to (5,4).\n- Turn 93: From (5,4), move L to (4,4).\n- This sequence continues to navigate the snake toward the left side where the food at (2,6) is located.\n\nThis ensures the snake avoids trapping itself and moves toward the high-value food at (2,6) within its lifespan.",

It's turn 89, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,6), and it's moving right (R). The body segments are listed: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]. So the snake is 19 segments long. The tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 3. Disappears in 3 turns.\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Disappears in 6 turns.\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Disappears in 9 turns.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,6), direction R. So moving right means next position would be (6,6) if I continue right.\n> \n> But let's check possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I can't move left (opposite) on the next turn. So for turn 89, I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n> \n> Snake body: I should list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied by the snake, but there's food at (4,2) and (4,3). Food at (4,3) and (4,2) are on snake body segments?\n> \n> (4,3) is a body segment, and (4,2) is also a body segment. But food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,3): food is at (4,3) with life span 1, and snake has a segment at (4,3) which is the 15th segment? Let's index: position 0: head (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (4,3), 15: (5,3), 16: (6,3), 17: (6,4), 18: (6,5) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is index 14, and (4,2) is index 13. Both have food on them, but since the snake is on them, they can't be eaten immediately. The food will only be accessible if the snake moves away from those cells.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 89. Since turn 89 is current, if it's not eaten now, it vanishes. But since the snake is on it, and head is not on it, it can't be eaten this turn. So it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,2) has life span 3, so it might be available later if the snake moves.\n> \n> But let's confirm the life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So for food at (4,3), life span 1 on turn 89: after this turn, it disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn 89 if head is on it. But head is at (5,6), not on (4,3), so impossible to eat this turn. Thus, this food will vanish.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,2) has life span 3: it will disappear after turn 91 (since turn 89,90,91, gone after 91).\n> \n> Turn t, life span N: exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, disappears after turn t+N-1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> For example, life span 1 on turn t: countdown starts at 1, decreases to 0 at end of turn, disappears.\n> \n> Life span 2: on turn t, countdown 2; turn t+1, countdown 1; disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Generally, food with life span N on turn t will disappear after turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (4,3): life span 1 on turn 89, disappears after turn 89 (i.e., not available turn 90).\n> \n> For (4,2): life span 3 on turn 89, disappears after turn 91 (available turns 89,90,91).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): life span 6, disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6): life span 9, disappears after turn 97.\n> \n> Now back to actions.\n> \n> Current head: (5,6), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves for turn 89: U, D, R (since L is opposite, not allowed).\n> \n> Now, what are the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,7) — y=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> y=7 is top border, wall, so (5,7) is invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,5) — is this free?

Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n> \n> x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y.\n> \n> (5,5): x=5, y=5, not on border, not (5,2), so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake has (4,5), (3,5), etc., but not (5,5). (5,5) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Right (R): (6,6) — is this valid? x=6, y=6. Borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, y=6 not border. Not (5,2), so should be free. Snake positions: no (6,6), so free.\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,6) — but (4,6) is the first body segment. Moving left to (4,6) would cause collision with body? But rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (4,6) is not the tail; tail is (6,5).

It's turn 91, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, etc. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,5), and direction is R (right). So the snake is moving right. The body segments follow: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). That's 19 segments. Let me count: positions from (6,5) to (6,3) – that's 19 cells. Indices: 0 to 18, so 19 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for (4,2), life_span=2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns? Since it decreases each turn, including current, after this turn (turn 91), life_span becomes 1, and after turn 92, it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5), direction R. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (continue), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is R, so cannot go L. So options: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state. I should sketch this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.

The snake is occupying (4,2)? Let's see the positions: (4,2) is the 15th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (4,3), 17: (5,3), 18: (6,3)\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body segment. But there's food at (4,2) as well? The food is at (4,2,2,1), but the snake is already on (4,2). According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, since the snake is on (4,2), the food there can't be eaten immediately. It will only be eatable if the snake moves away from that cell, and later the head moves back when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other food points.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,4), but (2,4) is also occupied by the snake? Positions: (2,4) is index 9: (2,4). Yes, occupied. Similarly, (2,6) and (1,6) are not in the snake positions, so they are free.\n> \n> List of occupied cells by snake: from above, all positions from (6,5) to (6,3).\n> \n> Free cells: not in snake positions and not walls.\n> \n> But (4,2) has food, but occupied, so not accessible now.\n> \n> (2,4) has food and occupied.\n> \n> (2,6) has food, and not occupied: (2,6) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> (1,6) not in positions, free.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (4,2), life_span=2, so after turn 91, it becomes 1; after turn 92, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only if the snake moves away and head comes back before turn 93.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life_span=4: after t91, 3 left; after t92, 2; t93,1; t94,0 gone. So must be eaten by turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6) life_span=7: after t91,6; t92,5; ... up to t98 gone? t91:7, after move, decreases, so at start of turn 91, life_span=7, after the turn, it decreases to 6, and so on. I need to be careful with timing.\n> \n> The life_span decreases every turn, including the current turn when we make a move. So when we are at turn t, the food has life_span S, it means that after S turns, it disappears. After turn t, S decreases by 1, so at the beginning of turn t, S is the remaining turns including t.\n> \n> For example, (4,2) at t91: life_span=2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns. So after turn 92, it's gone. It can be eaten on turn 91 or 92.\n> \n> If eaten on turn 91, it's consumed; if not, on turn 92 it can be eaten, but after turn 92, it disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life_span=4: can be eaten on turns 91,92,93,94; disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6) life_span=7: can be eaten turns 91 to 97; disappears after 97.\n> \n> (1,6) life_span=10: turns 91 to 100.\n> \n> But since the grid is small, and snake is long, we need to plan moves.\n> \n> Now, current head at (6,5), direction R. Possible moves: U (to (6,6)), D (to (6,4)), R (to (7,5)).\n> \n> But (7,5) is a wall because x=7 is border wall, so R is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so moving R to (7,5) is death.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (6,6): is (6,6) free? Snake positions: (6,6) not listed, but let's see y=6: positions have (5,6) which is index 2, and (4,6) index 3, but (6,6) not occupied. Also, walls: y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is not wall. x=6,y=6 should be within bounds, not wall except borders, so (6,6) is free? But internal obstacles? Only (5,2), so yes, (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,4): (6,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> R to (7,5): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6) or D to (6,4). R is blocked by wall, L is opposite direction, not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction R, so L is left, opposite, not allowed. So only U and D are possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose between U or D for turn 91.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I go U to (6,6).\n> \n> Then head moves to (6,6), and the tail moves forward?

Let's see: positions: after move, new head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) is now body, then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), and tail (6,3) is removed, so (5,3) becomes the new tail?

After moving without eating, snake length remains 19, but tail moves, so the new head is (6,6), and the body from index 0 to 17 become index 1 to 18? Better to think: the new head is the new position, then the previous positions from 0 to 17 become the new body segments 1 to 18, but since we remove the tail, the last segment (index 18) is removed, so we have segments from new head and previous 0 to 17 except we take sublist.\n> \n> Standard: after move, new position list: [new_head] + positions[:-1] if no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,6), then positions[0] to positions[17]: positions[0] is (6,5), positions[1] is (5,5), ..., positions[17] is (5,3)? positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (4,3), 17: (5,3), 18: (6,3)\n> \n> After move U to (6,6), no food, so new positions: [(6,6)] + positions[0:18] but positions[0:18] is up to index 17? positions[0] to positions[17] is 18 elements, but with new head, it would be 19, but we need to remove the last.\n> \n> [new_head] + positions[:-1]\n> \n> positions[:-1] is positions from 0 to 17 inclusive, which is 18 elements.\n> \n> new_head is one, so 19 positions, but we remove the tail, so it should be 19 positions but the last one is discarded?

It's turn 91, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, etc. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,5), and direction is R (right). So the snake is moving right. The body segments follow: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). That's 19 segments. Let me count: positions from (6,5) to (6,3) – that's 19 cells. Indices: 0 to 18, so 19 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for (4,2), life_span=2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns? Since it decreases each turn, including current, after this turn (turn 91), life_span becomes 1, and after turn 92, it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5), direction R. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (continue), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is R, so cannot go L. So options: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state. I should sketch this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.

The snake is occupying (4,2)? Let's see the positions: (4,2) is the 15th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (4,3), 17: (5,3), 18: (6,3)\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body segment. But there's food at (4,2) as well? The food is at (4,2,2,1), but the snake is already on (4,2). According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, since the snake is on (4,2), the food there can't be eaten immediately. It will only be eatable if the snake moves away from that cell, and later the head moves back when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other food points.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,4), but (2,4) is also occupied by the snake? Positions: (2,4) is index 9: (2,4). Yes, occupied. Similarly, (2,6) and (1,6) are not in the snake positions, so they are free.\n> \n> List of occupied cells by snake: from above, all positions from (6,5) to (6,3).\n> \n> Free cells: not in snake positions and not walls.\n> \n> But (4,2) has food, but occupied, so not accessible now.\n> \n> (2,4) has food and occupied.\n> \n> (2,6) has food, and not occupied: (2,6) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> (1,6) not in positions, free.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (4,2), life_span=2, so after turn 91, it becomes 1; after turn 92, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only if the snake moves away and head comes back before turn 93.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life_span=4: after t91, 3 left; after t92, 2; t93,1; t94,0 gone. So must be eaten by turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6) life_span=7: after t91,6; t92,5; ... up to t98 gone? t91:7, after move, decreases, so at start of turn 91, life_span=7, after the turn, it decreases to 6, and so on. I need to be careful with timing.\n> \n> The life_span decreases every turn, including the current turn when we make a move. So when we are at turn t, the food has life_span S, it means that after S turns, it disappears. After turn t, S decreases by 1, so at the beginning of turn t, S is the remaining turns including t.\n> \n> For example, (4,2) at t91: life_span=2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns. So after turn 92, it's gone. It can be eaten on turn 91 or 92.\n> \n> If eaten on turn 91, it's consumed; if not, on turn 92 it can be eaten, but after turn 92, it disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life_span=4: can be eaten on turns 91,92,93,94; disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6) life_span=7: can be eaten turns 91 to 97; disappears after 97.\n> \n> (1,6) life_span=10: turns 91 to 100.\n> \n> But since the grid is small, and snake is long, we need to plan moves.\n> \n> Now, current head at (6,5), direction R. Possible moves: U (to (6,6)), D (to (6,4)), R (to (7,5)).\n> \n> But (7,5) is a wall because x=7 is border wall, so R is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so moving R to (7,5) is death.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (6,6): is (6,6) free? Snake positions: (6,6) not listed, but let's see y=6: positions have (5,6) which is index 2, and (4,6) index 3, but (6,6) not occupied. Also, walls: y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is not wall. x=6,y=6 should be within bounds, not wall except borders, so (6,6) is free? But internal obstacles? Only (5,2), so yes, (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,4): (6,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> R to (7,5): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6) or D to (6,4). R is blocked by wall, L is opposite direction, not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction R, so L is left, opposite, not allowed. So only U and D are possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose between U or D for turn 91.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I go U to (6,6).\n> \n> Then head moves to (6,6), and the tail moves forward? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail moves off.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,3), index 18.\n> \n> After move U: head to (6,6), then body: (6,5) becomes segment 1, (5,5) segment 2, ..., up to (5,3) segment 18? Let's see: positions: after move, new head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) is now body, then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), and tail (6,3) is removed, so (5,3) becomes the new tail? Positions: the last segment was (6,3), which is removed, so the new positions are from (6,6) down to (5,3), which is 19 segments? No.\n> \n> Original positions: 19 segments. After moving without eating, snake length remains 19, but tail moves, so the new head is (6,6), and the body from index 0 to 17 become index 1 to 18? Better to think: the new head is the new position, then the previous positions from 0 to 17 become the new body segments 1 to 18, but since we remove the tail, the last segment (index 18) is removed, so we have segments from new head and previous 0 to 17 except we take sublist.\n> \n> Standard: after move, new position list: [new_head] + positions[:-1] if no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,6), then positions[0] to positions[17]: positions[0] is (6,5), positions[1] is (5,5), ..., positions[17] is (5,3)? positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (4,3), 17: (5,3), 18: (6,3)\n> \n> After move U to (6,6), no food, so new positions: [(6,6)] + positions[0:18] but positions[0:18] is up to index 17? positions[0] to positions[17] is 18 elements, but with new head, it would be 19, but we need to remove the last.\n> \n> [new_head] + positions[:-1]\n> \n> positions[:-1] is positions from 0 to 17 inclusive, which is 18 elements.\n> \n> new_head is one, so 19 positions, but we remove the tail, so it should be 19 positions but the last one is discarded? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, when no food, the tail is removed, so the new list has the same length: [new_head] + body_positions[:-1]\n> \n> body_positions is the current list without head? Better: the current positions list has head at index 0.\n> \n> After moving to new cell without eating, the new head is the new cell, and the new body is the old head to the second-to-last segment, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [new_head] + current_positions[0:-1]\n> \n> current_positions[0:-1] is from index 0 to index 17 for 19 elements? current_positions has 19 elements, indices 0 to 18.\n> \n> current_positions[0:-1] is indices 0 to 17, which is 18 elements.\n> \n> Then new_head + that is 19 elements, but we should have 18 since tail removed. Contradiction.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Length of snake: 19 segments.\n> \n> When moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: the new head position, followed by the positions of the old head, old segment 1, ..., up to old segment 17.

Thinking Conclusion\n> \n> The chosen sequence prioritizes immediate survival by avoiding the deadly upward move to (6,6), which traps the snake with no valid moves on the next turn. Moving down to (6,4) opens space to navigate leftward toward the food area near (2,6) and (1,6), while allowing the snake's body to shift and free up cells for future food access over the next 5+ turns. This approach balances risk avoidance with gradual progress toward high-value food targets, leveraging the longer life spans of (2,6) and (1,6).\n",

From (5,4), this is unlikely due to body blocking the path.\n3. **Food at (1, 6)**: More time to reach (until turn 100). A longer-term goal.\n4. **Immediate Moves**:\n   - **Down (D) to (5, 3)**:\n     - Avoids collision.\n     - Opens a path to the right side (e.g., (6,3)) if needed later.\n   - **Left (L) to (4, 4)**:\n     - Moves towards the left side where the food is.\n     - May eventually allow reaching (1,6) via (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (1,6), but some steps are currently blocked.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Down (D) to (5, 3)** is safer and avoids immediate deadlocks. It keeps options open for future moves towards the right or left, depending on how the snake's body shifts.\n- Moving Left (L) risks getting stuck in the coiled body area with limited escape routes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

### Action Sequence (in order):\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 93: L\n> Turn 94: D\n> Turn 95: L\n> Turn 96: U\n> Turn 97: D\n> Turn 98: L\n> Turn 99: U\n> Turn 100: U\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion (one or two sentences):\n> \n> The chosen sequence prioritizes long-term survival by avoiding congested body areas and immediate risks, moving towards open space to position for eating the (1,6) food before it expires at turn 100, while accepting that the other foods are unreachable due to short life spans and body blockages. This path minimizes collision risks and leverages the snake's movement to gradually access the target food.\n",
