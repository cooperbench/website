Snake length remains 3.\n   - New snake positions: Head at (4, 3), body at (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Next moves can be U, D, or L (no instant reverse to R).\n   - This path does not lead to any immediate food and may miss (5, 1) due to its short life span.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Moving **R to (6, 3)** is the better choice because:\n  - It immediately scores +1.\n  - It positions the snake to potentially reach (6, 1) later, which has a long life span.\n  - The alternative (L) does not lead to any food and risks missing the short-lived (5, 1).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Move right (R) to (6, 3) on turn 12 to eat the food there.\n2. Move down (D) to (6, 2) on turn 13.\n3. Move down (D) to (6, 1) on turn 14 to eat the food there.\n4. Continue moving left (L) to open areas for survival.\n\n### Current Turn \\( t_0 = 13 \\):\nThe snake is at [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)], having just moved right to (6, 3) on turn 12 (as planned). The head direction is R (right). \n\n#### Possible Moves from (6, 3):\n1. **Up (U) to (6, 4)**:\n   - (6, 4) is the tail segment. Rule: Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - No food at (6, 4), so no growth.\n   - New positions: head at (6, 4), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Head direction becomes U (up).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (6, 2)**:\n   - (6, 2) is empty (no wall or snake).\n   - No food at (6, 2), so no growth.\n   - New positions: head at (6, 2), body at (6, 3), (5, 3), tail at (5, 4).\n   - Head direction becomes D (down).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - (5, 3) is a body segment (not the tail), so this is a collision. Invalid.\n   - Rule: Cannot move into non-tail body segments.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (7, 3)**:\n   - x=7 is a wall. Invalid.\n\n#### No Instant Reverse:\n- Current direction is R (right). Reverse is L (left), but moving L is already invalid due to collision, so no issue.\n\n#### Food Considerations:\n- (5, 1): Will disappear after turn 14 (current life_span = 2, so disappears after turn 14). Cannot be reached in time due to the wall at (5, 2).\n- (6, 1): Can be reached by moving down twice (D to (6, 2), then D to (6, 1)).\n- (2, 2): Too far away and not worth pursuing given other options.\n\n#### Best Move:\nFollow the previous plan: move **D (down)** to (6, 2) to set up for eating (6, 1) on turn 14. This maximizes score by eating (6, 1) while avoiding risks.\n\n### Action for Turn \\( t_0 = 13 \\):\n\\boxed{D}",

Possible moves:\n  - R to (5,3): free.\n  - U to (4,4): food at (4,4).\n  - D to (4,2): free.\n- If we move U to (4,4) at turn 23, we eat the food at (4,4), increasing length to 8.\n- Then, at turn 24, head at (4,4), direction U. Possible moves:\n  - U to (4,5): free.\n  - L to (3,4): body (collision).\n  - R to (5,4): free.\n- This path allows eating (4,4) safely.\n\n#### Move U to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- New body: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n- Tail: (4,1) (food under tail).\n- Next turn (23), head at (3,4), direction U. Possible moves:\n  - U to (3,5): free.\n  - L to (2,4): free.\n  - R to (4,4): food at (4,4).\n- If we move R to (4,4) at turn 23, we eat the food at (4,4), increasing length to 8.\n- Then, at turn 24, head at (4,4), direction R. Possible moves:\n  - R to (5,4): free.\n  - U to (4,5): free.\n  - D to (4,3): free.\n- This path also allows eating (4,4) safely.\n\n### Avoiding (4,1) Food:\nThe food at (4,1) is risky to eat because:\n- It is under the tail, and eating it requires moving the head to (4,1) when it is free.\n- After eating, the head would be at (4,1), and the new body segment would be adjacent (e.g., at (4,2)), causing a collision.\nThus, it is safer to avoid (4,1) and focus on (4,4).\n\n### Decision:\nBoth initial moves (R to (4,3) and U to (3,4)) allow safely eating (4,4) on the next turn. However, moving **U to (3,4)** is slightly better because:\n- It positions the snake closer to (4,4), making the path more straightforward.\n- It avoids potential complications with the (4,1) food.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nAt turn 22, the best immediate action is to move **U (up)** to (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Must eat now or next turn.\n   - (3,6): Life span 8 (available until Turn 34), can be pursued later.\n\n3. **Safety**: Moving D to (4,2) is safe (no walls/obstacles, no body collision). Next move D to (4,1) is also safe (no tail reward danger; tail is at (2,3), not adjacent to (4,1)).\n\n4. **Long-Term Plan**: After eating (4,1), navigate left/up to reach (3,6) while avoiding dead ends.\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is \\boxed{D}.",

Currently under the tail.\n  - (2,1): value +1, life span 8 (must be eaten by Turn 40).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Down (D) next turn since current direction is U.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom (3,4), the snake can move:\n1. **Up (U)**: to (3,5).\n   - (3,5) is free (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n   - Next turn (Turn 34), can move U to (3,6) to eat the food there before it disappears.\n2. **Left (L)**: to (2,4).\n   - (2,4) is free.\n   - Cannot reach (3,6) in time to eat it by Turn 34.\n3. **Right (R)**: to (4,4).\n   - (4,4) is a body segment (not tail), so this is a collision. Invalid move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The food at (3,6) is urgent (life span 2). To eat it:\n  - Must be at (3,5) on Turn 33, then move to (3,6) on Turn 34.\n- The food at (4,5) is under the tail. To eat it:\n  - Must move the tail away first (e.g., by moving U or L on Turn 33), then move the head to (4,5) later.\n  - However, the head is not adjacent to the tail (diagonal), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\" if eaten later.\n- The food at (2,1) is less urgent (life span 8).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move U to (3,5)** on Turn 33. This allows:\n  - Eating (3,6) on Turn 34 (urgent).\n  - Freeing (4,5) for potential later eating (tail moves away).\n  - Avoiding collision or dead ends.\n\n### Why Not L to (2,4)?\n- Cannot reach (3,6) in time to eat it by Turn 34.\n- (4,5) is still under the tail after moving L, and reaching it later would be difficult due to body segments blocking the path.\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

To eat them, the snake must move such that the body moves away from the food cell, and then the head can move onto it.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Down (D) to (6, 2)**:\n   - From (6, 2), the only safe move is Down to (6, 1), leading to a potential dead end.\n   - This path doesn't seem to help in freeing the food cells soon.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - This move starts heading towards the left side of the grid where the foods are located.\n   - It provides more flexibility for future moves to eventually free and eat the foods.\n\n### Plan to Eat Food at (1, 2):\n- The food at (1, 2) will be freed when the tail moves away from it. The tail is currently at (4, 1), and it will take several moves to reach (1, 2).\n- By moving left now, we can start positioning the snake to be near (1, 2) when it becomes free (around turn 78).\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger:\n- The food at (1, 2) will be under the tail on turn 78. Eating it directly then would cause a collision (head and tail at same cell after growth).\n- Instead, we need to ensure that when we eat (1, 2), it is not under the tail. This requires careful timing, but moving left now is a step towards that goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (5, 3) to start positioning the snake towards the food at (1, 2) and avoid dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The body must move away from the food cell.\n  2. The head must then move onto the freed food cell.\n- Given the snake's length (19 segments), it will take many moves for the segments covering the food to become the tail and free the cells. The food's life spans are too short for this (especially (4,3) with life span 5). Thus, **we cannot eat any food in time**.\n\n### Survival Strategy:\nSince we cannot eat the food, we must prioritize survival by moving to open spaces and avoiding dead ends. \n\n#### Option 1: Move R to (3,5)\n- From (3,5), possible next moves:\n  - U to (3,6): Free.\n  - D to (3,4): Free.\n  - R to (4,5): Free.\n- This opens up more options for future moves and avoids immediate dead ends.\n\n#### Option 2: Move U to (2,6)\n- From (2,6), possible next moves:\n  - L to (1,6): Free, but leads to a dead end (no further moves from (1,6)).\n  - R to (3,6): Free, but may also lead to limited options.\n- This path is riskier as it may trap the snake sooner.\n\n### Decision:\n**Move R to (3,5)** is safer because it provides more flexibility for future moves and avoids immediate dead ends. \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Not a good option.\n\n### Evaluating Move Right (R) to (5,6)\n\n1. **Move to (5,6)**:\n   - New head: (5,6).\n   - Body: [(4,6), (4,5), ..., (5,5)] (tail at (5,5) is removed).\n   - Direction changes to R.\n\n2. **Next Move from (5,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (5,7) — wall.\n     - D: (5,5) — free (tail was just removed).\n     - L: (4,6) — occupied by body segment (4,6).\n     - R: (6,6) — free.\n   - Possible moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\n#### Option 1: Move D to (5,5)\n\n1. **Move to (5,5)**:\n   - No food eaten, tail is removed.\n   - New head: (5,5).\n   - Body: [(5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,4)].\n\n2. **Next Move from (5,5)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (5,6) — occupied by body segment (5,6).\n     - D: (5,4) — free.\n     - L: (4,5) — occupied by body segment (4,5).\n     - R: (6,5) — free.\n   - Possible moves: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nThis path seems safer, allowing more flexibility in future moves without immediate death.\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (6,6)\n\n1. **Move to (6,6)**:\n   - No food eaten, tail is removed.\n   - New head: (6,6).\n   - Body: [(5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,4)].\n\n2. **Next Move from (6,6)**:\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (6,7) — wall.\n     - D: (6,5) — free.\n     - L: (5,6) — occupied by body segment (5,6).\n     - R: (7,6) — wall.\n   - Only possible move: D to (6,5).\n\nThis also seems safe but leads the snake towards the corner, which might limit future options.\n\n### Choosing the Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven that moving L leads to certain death, moving R is the only viable option. Between the two sub-options after moving R:\n\n- Moving D to (5,5) seems better as it keeps the snake more centered, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n- Moving R to (6,6) corners the snake, which might be risky in the long run.\n\nHowever, the immediate action is to move R to (5,6), and the subsequent moves can be decided based on the new state.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt turn 88, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5,6), avoiding the deadly path to the left.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The tail is at (6,4).\n\n**Food**:\n- (4,2): Value +1, Life span 3 (disappears after turn 92).\n- (2,4): Value +1, Life span 5 (disappears after turn 94).\n- (2,6): Value +1, Life span 8 (disappears after turn 97).\n\n**Possible Moves**:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6) is occupied by the body segment immediately behind the head. Moving here would cause a collision. Invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4) is free (not occupied by the snake or walls).\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5) is occupied by a body segment. Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5) is free (not occupied by the snake or walls).\n\n**Valid Moves**: D or R.\n\n### Decision for Turn \\( t_0 = 90 \\)\n\nFrom the previous plan at turn 89, the intended action sequence was:\n- Turn 89: D (already executed, head now at (5,5), direction D.\n- Turn 90: R (as per the plan).\n\nHowever, let's verify if moving R to (6,5) is safe and optimal:\n- (6,5) is free.\n- After moving R, the new head direction would be R (since we moved right from (5,5)).\n- On the next turn (turn 91), the possible moves from (6,5) would be U, D, or R (cannot move L opposite to R).\n  - U to (6,6): Free.\n  - D to (6,4): Occupied by the tail (6,4), but the tail will move away, so this is safe.\n  - R to (7,5): Wall (x=7), invalid.\n- Moving R now sets up a path where we can continue to navigate the right side safely.\n\nAlternative: Move D to (5,4):\n- (5,4) is free.\n- New head direction would be D.\n- On turn 91, from (5,4), possible moves:\n  - D to (5,3): Occupied by body segment (5,3). Invalid.\n  - L to (4,4): Free.\n  - R to (6,4): Occupied by tail (6,4), safe.\n- This path might lead to more constrained options later.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving R to (6,5) is safer and aligns with the previous plan to navigate toward the right side where there is more space.\n\n### Updated Action Sequence\n\nGiven that the previous plan was to move R on turn 90, and this move is safe and optimal, we will proceed with:\n\n\\boxed{R} \n\n### Next Steps (for context):\n\nFollowing this move:\n- Turn 90: R to (6,5).\n- Turn 91: From (6,5), move D to (6,4) (tail cell, safe).\n- Turn 92: From (6,4), move L to (5,4).\n- Turn 93: From (5,4), move L to (4,4).\n- This sequence continues to navigate the snake toward the left side where the food at (2,6) is located.\n\nThis ensures the snake avoids trapping itself and moves toward the high-value food at (2,6) within its lifespan.",

It keeps options open for future moves towards the right or left, depending on how the snake's body shifts.\n- Moving Left (L) risks getting stuck in the coiled body area with limited escape routes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

The previous plan at Turn 93 was to move **L (left)** to (4,4), and the next action at Turn 94 is to move **D (down)** to (4,3). \n\nHere’s the reasoning:\n1. The previous plan (from Turn 93) is still valid, as no new information contradicts it.\n2. Moving **D (down)** to (4,3) avoids collisions (the cell is free) and aligns with the long-term goal of positioning the snake to eventually reach the (1,6) food.\n3. This move is safe: it does not reverse direction (current direction is **D** after Turn 93's **L**), and it does not collide with the body or walls.\n\nThus, the action for Turn 94 is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",
