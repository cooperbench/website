        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction L, meaning it's moving left. The snake has only one segment, which is the head, so no body yet. Since it's just the head, there's no tail to worry about colliding with immediately.\n\nThe walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). I should list all blocked cells for clarity.\n\nBlocked cells:\n\n- Borders: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\n- Internal: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1.\n\nSnake head at (3,3), direction L, so it just moved left to (3,3)? Positions are given as [(3,3)], and head direction is L, meaning it's facing left. Since it's the only segment, it can move in any direction except right, because no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up (U): (3,4)\n\n- Down (D): (3,2)\n\n- Left (L): (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): (4,3) but since current direction is L, moving right is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nNow, check what cells are safe to move to.\n\nFirst, grid boundaries: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (3,4) is y=4, which is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y from 1 to 6 are safe? No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are inside, but (0,y) or (7,y) or (x,0) or (x,7) are walls. Similarly, internal obstacles.\n\nFor (3,4): x=3, y=4. Is it a wall? Borders: x=0 or 7, no; y=0 or 7, no. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2) — (3,4) not in list, so safe.\n\n(3,2) is an internal obstacle, so (3,2) is blocked.\n\n(2,3): x=2, y=3, not border, not in internal obstacles list: internal are (3,2),(4,5),(3,6),(3,1),(2,2). (2,3) not there, so safe.\n\n(4,3): but cannot move right because opposite direction.\n\n(3,2) is down, but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nList possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,4) — not wall, not border\n\n- D: (3,2) — but (3,2) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- L: (2,3) — not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (2,2) but not (2,3)), so safe.\n\n- R: (4,3) — not wall, but cannot move because opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible moves are U or L. D is blocked by wall, R is forbidden by no reverse.\n\nTherefore, from (3,3), I can move Up to (3,4) or Left to (2,3).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nCurrent snake length is 1, since only head. Eating food increases length by 1.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (5,3): at x=5,y=3, value +1\n\n- (4,1): x=4,y=1, +1\n\n- (1,6): x=1,y=6, +1\n\nAll have life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if not eaten, they last 10 turns from now.\n\nBut since turn is 0, they last until turn 10? Let's see: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 0, life span is 10, so it will decrease to 9 on turn 1, 8 on turn 2, ..., down to 0 on turn 10, and disappear after that, so available from turn 0 to turn 10 inclusive? Countdown from 10 to 0, so on turn when countdown is 0, it should still be there, I think, and disappear after that turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, at turn t+1, L-1, ..., when L=0, it might be eaten or disappear.\n\nBut typically, if countdown is k, it has k turns left including current.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that food with life span L at turn t will be available until turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1 for turn t+1. So on the turn when countdown is 1, it is still there, and after that turn, it disappears.\n\nFor example, food at turn 0 with life span 10: on turn 0, available; after turn 0, countdown 9 for turn 1; ... on turn 9, countdown 1; after turn 9, countdown 0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, here life span 10 at turn 0, so available from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nBut since we start at turn 0, and we act on turns, it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to moves: I can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, since snake is length 1, no body, so no collision with body yet. After eating one food, length becomes 2, then I have to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid for visualization.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are inside. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nBut internal obstacles block some cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (2,2) are near the bottom left, (4,5) and (3,6) elsewhere.\n\nFood at (5,3), (4,1), (1,6)\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), that's closer to (1,6) but (1,6) is at y=6, which is border? y=6 is not border, border is y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is inside, but adjacent to border.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 is safe.\n\n(2,3) to (1,6) is not direct, need to move.\n\nIf I move up to (3,4), then I can go towards (5,3) or something.\n\nBut (5,3) is at same y, different x.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,1), which is down.\n\nBut from (3,3), down is blocked by wall at (3,2).\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nLet me sketch a small grid.\n\nLabel rows and columns.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nBut playable cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n\nSo blocked cells: (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\nAnd borders all around.\n\nFood: (5,3), (4,1), (1,6)\n\nSnake: (3,3)\n\nCurrent direction L.\n\nMoves: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3)\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move left to (2,3):\n\n- Turn 0: move L to (2,3). New head position (2,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow snake position: [(2,3)] since no body yet.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), still length 1.\n\nThen on turn 1, from (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nU: (2,4)\n\nD: (2,2) but (2,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move D.\n\nL: (1,3)\n\nR: (3,3) but opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (2,4) or L to (1,3)\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then I can go towards (1,6), but (1,6) is up or down? (1,3) to (1,6) is same x, y from 3 to 6, so need to go up.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFrom (1,3), move up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — but need to check if path clear.\n\ny=1 to 6, and no obstacles at x=1 except borders, but x=1 is not border, borders are x=0 and x=7.\n\nInternal obstacles are at (2,2),(3,1),etc., not at x=1 except (1,6) is food, not obstacle.\n\n(1,6) is food, so cell is free until eaten.\n\nSo from (1,3) to (1,6) is possible by moving up: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nBut on turn when I reach (1,6), I eat the food, length becomes 2.\n\nNow, if I move up to (2,4) from (2,3), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (1,6). If I go left first to (2,3), then to (1,3), then up to (1,6), that would be 3 moves to eat it.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3) move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 2: from (1,3) move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,6) — eat food, length=2.\n\nBut on turn 4, I eat (1,6), so after eating, snake has head at (1,6) and tail at (1,5)? When I eat, the tail grows, but since I move to food, head moves to (1,6), and since I ate, length increases, so positions: head at (1,6), and the previous position becomes body. Start with length 1 at (1,5) before move? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 3: snake at (1,5), say, after moving to (1,5) from previous.\n\nAssume at turn 2: after move U to (1,4), snake at (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,5), snake at (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,6), which has food, so eat it. Head moves to (1,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added, so snake becomes [(1,6), (1,5)] — head at (1,6), body at (1,5).\n\nDirection after move U.\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 10 at turn 0, so on turn 4, how many turns passed? Turn 0 to turn 4 is 5 turns? Turn count: turn 0,1,2,3,4 — that's 5 actions, but the food life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, before turn 1, life span 9? Or during turn.\n\nI think \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" means at the start of turn, or end?\n\nTo be precise, let's assume that at the beginning of each turn, before action, the life span decreases.\n\nBut the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that for food, at turn t, with initial life span N, after k turns, life span is N - k.\n\nAt turn k, if life span N - k > 0, food is present.\n\nWhen N - k = 0, it disappears after that turn or before?\n\nTo avoid confusion, since life span is long (10 turns), and we are at turn 0, all food will last at least 10 turns, so for short term planning, all are available.\n\nSimilarly here, (1,6) at turn 4, life span was 10 at turn 0, so after 4 turns, life span 10-4=6, still there.\n\nSo eating on turn 4 is fine.\n\nNow back to choice.\n\nIf I go left now, I can eat (1,6) in 4 turns, but I need to consider other options.\n\nIf I move up to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Current direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nU: (3,5)\n\nD: not allowed\n\nL: (2,4)\n\nR: (4,4)\n\nNow, (3,5) is free? Obstacles: (4,5) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so safe.\n\n(2,4) safe, (4,4) safe.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go towards (5,3) or (4,1), but (4,1) is down and left, and (3,2) is blocked, so hard to reach (4,1) from north.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is near obstacle (3,1) and (3,2).\n\nPaths to (4,1): for example, from (4,2) or (5,1), but (4,2) might be accessible.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), but (4,3) is where? Not obstacle, then to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is food.\n\nSequence: turn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4) — direction R\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3) — but current direction R, moving D is not opposite? Opposite of R is L, D is down, different direction, so allowed.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R; opposites are U-D, L-R.\n\nSo from R, moving D is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen at (4,3), move to (5,3) by R, but direction is D? After moving D to (4,3), direction is D.\n\nThen move R to (5,3): from D, moving R is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSo turn 3: move R to (5,3) — eat food.\n\nSo in 3 turns, I can eat (5,3) if I go up first.\n\nCompared to going left, which takes 4 turns to eat (1,6).\n\nBut (5,3) is closer in terms of turns: 3 vs 4.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is farther, but let's see if I can eat both or plan long term.\n\nI need to maximize score, so I should eat as many as possible, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, and I have to avoid colliding with body.\n\nMoreover, there is a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, no food on tail, and tail doesn't exist yet.\n\nFirst, let's compare the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen at (2,3), I can go to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then to (1,6) as before.\n\nBut from (1,3) to (1,6), I need to go up, but y=6 is not border, but there is obstacle at (3,6), which is not on x=1.\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, so on x=1, no obstacles.\n\nSo (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) is clear.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), snake at [(1,6),(1,5)], length 2, direction U.\n\nThen I can move to other food.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), I can move left? x=1, left to x=0 is wall, cannot. Or down to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, cannot move there. Or right to (2,6), or up to (1,7) but y=7 is border wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move: right to (2,6), since down to body, up to wall, left to wall.\n\n(1,5) is body, so if I move down to (1,5), collision.\n\nSo only right to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free? Obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), so (2,6) should be ok.\n\nBorders: y=6<7, x=2>0, so safe.\n\nSo after eating at (1,6), move to (2,6).\n\nThen snake positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nNow, food left: (5,3) and (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, might be hard to reach.\n\n(5,3) is at middle.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move down or left or right, but left to (1,6) is body, cannot; up to (2,7) y=7 wall; down to (2,5); right to (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\n(3,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: down to (2,5) or right not possible, left not, up not, so only down to (2,5).\n\nMove D to (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen snake: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6)? Positions: after move to (2,6), snake was [(2,6),(1,6)]\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5), head to (2,5), and body: since no food eaten, tail moves, so body becomes [(2,5), (2,6)]? Movement: head moves to new position, and tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n\nStandard snake: when move, head goes to new cell, if food, grow, else tail moves off.\n\nHere: \"Snake Positions\" update.\n\nWhen snake moves to a cell without food, head moves, tail is removed.\n\nWith food, head moves, new segment added, tail stays.\n\nIn this case, at turn 4: after moving to (1,6) and eating, positions [(1,6), (1,5)] — (1,5) is tail.\n\nTurn 5: move to (2,6), no food there, so head to (2,6), tail (1,5) removed? But (1,5) was body, after move, the body should be only the previous head.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before turn 5: snake at [(1,6), (1,5)] head at (1,6)\n\n- Move to (2,6): head moves to (2,6), and since no food at (2,6), the tail (1,5) is removed, so new snake positions: [(2,6)]? No, the body segment is the previous head position.\n\nTypically: positions list: [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]\n\nWhen moving to new cell without food: new head position, and remove the tail position, so the body segments shift.\n\nWith food: new head position, and keep all body, add new segment.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (1,6), snake is [(1,6), (1,5)] — head (1,6), body segment at (1,5), so one body segment.\n\nLength 2.\n\nNow, move to (2,6): no food, so head moves to (2,6), and the tail (1,5) is removed, so new positions: only [(2,6)]? But the body segment at (1,6) should be the new tail.\n\nPositions: before move: [head: (1,6), tail: (1,5)]\n\nAfter move: head to (2,6), so new head (2,6), and the segment that was head becomes body, so positions: [(2,6), (1,6)] — tail at (1,6).\n\nThe tail position (1,5) is removed.\n\nSo now snake at [(2,6), (1,6)]\n\nThen move down to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food, so tail (1,6) removed, new positions: [(2,5), (2,6)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBack to option.\n\nFrom (2,6), move to (2,5), then I can go to (2,4), (2,3), etc., towards (5,3) or (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is at bottom, and there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1), from (2,3), I can go to (3,3) but (3,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt that time, snake is elsewhere.\n\nBut this path seems messy, and (4,1) might be hard to reach because of obstacles at (3,1), (3,2), (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is obstacle, so from (2,3), I can go down to (2,2)? No, (2,2) is wall.\n\nLeft to (1,3), but (1,3) might be free.\n\nBut to go to (4,1), I need to go east and south.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), go right to (3,3), but at that point, snake might be there or not.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nNow, option 2: move up to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen I can eat (5,3) faster.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)  // direction now R\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3)  // direction D\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3) eat food // direction R\n\nNow snake: after eating, head at (5,3), body at (4,3)? Before move, at turn 2, snake at (4,3) after moving there? Let's trace positions.\n\nStart turn 0: snake [(3,3)]\n\nMove U to (3,4): positions [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4) move R to (4,4): positions [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4) move D to (4,3): positions [(4,3)]\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3) move R to (5,3): (5,3) has food, so eat, positions now [(5,3), (4,3)] head at (5,3), body at (4,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow from (5,3), I can move to other food.\n\nAvailable food: (4,1) and (1,6)\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is close but blocked by obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, (4,1) is at (4,1), but (3,1) and (3,2) are obstacles, so to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) or (5,1), but (4,2) is not obstacle, but how to get there.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU: (5,4)\n\nD: (5,2)\n\nL: not allowed\n\nR: (6,3)\n\nNow, (5,2) is down, y=2, not border.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so cannot go left to (4,3).\n\nAlso, (5,2) is free, then from there to (5,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to (4,1), but (4,1) is food.\n\nBut (4,2) might be accessible.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,2), which is near.\n\nFrom (5,3), move D to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), move D to (5,1)? (5,1) is not border? y=1, border is y=0, so y=1 is inside? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(5,1) should be free, no obstacle listed.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), etc., not (5,1).\n\nSo from (5,2), move D to (5,1), then left to (4,1)? (4,1) is food.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), from (5,1) move L to (4,1).\n\nBut need to check if (4,1) is reachable.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nAt (5,1), move L to (4,1).\n\nBut direction: from (5,3) move D to (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen move D to (5,1), direction D.\n\nThen move L to (4,1): from D, moving L is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen eat (4,1) on turn, say, turn 6 if I start from turn 3.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) at turn 3, positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)  // direction D\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (5,3)? After move, no food, so tail removed: before move, positions [(5,3),(4,3)], head (5,3)\n\nMove to (5,2): no food, so head to (5,2), tail (4,3) removed, body: (5,3) becomes tail, so positions [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,1)  // direction D\n\nEat? (5,1) no food, so head to (5,1), tail (5,3) removed? Tail was (5,3), removed, body (5,2) becomes tail, positions [(5,1), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (4,1)  // (4,1) has food, eat\n\nHead to (4,1), food eaten, so grow, positions [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)]? Before move: positions [(5,1), (5,2)] head (5,1)\n\nMove to (4,1): head (4,1), and since food, add new segment, so body includes previous head (5,1), and tail (5,2) remains, so positions [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, I also have (1,6) to eat, but it's far, and life span 10, so by turn 10 it disappears.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go north or east, but west to (3,1) is obstacle, south to (4,0) wall, east to (5,1) is body, cannot, north to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free? Obstacles: (3,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,3) or (3,2) blocked, etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,6), it's a long way, and with obstacles, might be risky with longer snake.\n\nBut let's see the first option.\n\nIn option 1, if I go left first to (1,6), I eat it on turn 4, then I am at (2,6) or something, then I can try to go to (5,3).\n\nFor example, from (2,6), after moving down to (2,5), then to (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), but (3,3) might be free, then to (4,3), (5,3).\n\nBut at turn 4, after eating (1,6), I am at (1,6) with body, then move to (2,6) on turn 5, then to (2,5) on turn 6, (2,4) turn 7, (2,3) turn 8, (3,3) turn 9, (4,3) turn 10, (5,3) turn 11 to eat.\n\nBut life span of (5,3) is 10 at turn 0, so at turn 11, it would have disappeared? Turn 0 to turn 10: 11 turns? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, before turn 1, life span 9.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9, before turn 10, life span 1.\n\nOn turn 10, if not eaten, it is still there? Or disappears before turn 10.\n\nThe rule: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nSo if life span N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1 or something.\n\nTo be precise, let's assume that at the start of turn, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L.\n\nAfter the turn, L decreases by 1.\n\nIf L=1 at start of turn, after the turn it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available for next turn.\n\nIf L>1, still available.\n\nFor food with life span 10 at turn 0:\n\n- Turn 0: L=10, available\n\n- After turn 0, L=9\n\n- Turn 1: L=9, available\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: L=1, available\n\n- After turn 9, L=0, disappears, not available on turn 10.\n\nSo available from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for all food.\n\nIn option 1, eating (1,6) on turn 4: turn 4 <=9, ok.\n\nThen to eat (5,3), if I reach on turn 11, turn 11 >9, not available.\n\nTurn 9 is last chance.\n\nTo eat (5,3) by turn 9.\n\nFrom after eating (1,6) at turn 4, position at (1,6) with body.\n\nTurn 5: move to (2,6) — now at (2,6)\n\nTurn 6: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: move to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: move to (3,3) — now at (3,3)\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), I am at (3,3), need to go to (4,3) then (5,3), but on turn 10? Turn 9 I am at (3,3), move to (4,3) on turn 10, but turn 10 food not available.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (3,3), and (5,3) is available only if I can reach on turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,3) is two steps: to (4,3) then (5,3), but on turn 9 I can only move one step, to (4,3) or elsewhere, not directly to (5,3).\n\nSo on turn 9, at (3,3), I can move to (4,3), but (5,3) is not eaten, and after turn 9 it disappears.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,3) in this path.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) on turn 8, I can move to (3,3) on turn 9, not to (5,3).\n\nSo (5,3) cannot be eaten if I go for (1,6) first.\n\n(4,1) might be eaten, but it's also far.\n\nIn option 2, by going up first, I eat (5,3) on turn 3, then I can try to eat (4,1) by around turn 6, and (1,6) might be possible if I go north.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) at turn 3, positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nThen I can go to (4,1) as before, by turn 6.\n\nBut (1,6) is at top left, far.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go up to (4,2), then to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, or to (3,2) blocked, etc.\n\nHard to reach (1,6) from south with obstacles.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (1,6) first if possible, but in the up path, from (3,4), I am at north, not close to (1,6).\n\nAnother option: from the start, move left to (2,3), then instead of going to (1,3), I could go up to (2,4), then to (1,4), etc., but still, to reach (1,6) it takes multiple turns.\n\nBut as above, if I eat (1,6) first, I miss (5,3).\n\nIf I eat (5,3) first, I might eat (4,1) and miss (1,6), but (1,6) has the same value, so not worse.\n\nBut there is also (4,1) which I can eat in both cases.\n\nIn the left-first option, after eating (1,6), I am at (2,6) or (2,5), then I can go down to eat (4,1).\n\nFor example, from (2,3) after some moves, but let's see.\n\nFrom (2,5), move to (2,4), (2,3), then from (2,3) I can go to (3,3), (4,3), but (4,3) is not food, then to (4,2)? (4,2) is free, then to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is food.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1)? But (4,2) to (4,1) is down.\n\nBut at (4,3), if I go to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\nBut life span: (4,1) life span 10 at turn 0, available until turn 9.\n\nIn left-first path: eat (1,6) at turn 4, then at turn 5 at (2,6), turn 6 at (2,5), turn 7 at (2,4), turn 8 at (2,3), turn 9 at (3,3), turn 10 at (4,3), but turn 10 food not available, and (4,1) not eaten.\n\nOn turn 9 at (3,3), I can move to (4,3) or to (3,4) etc., but not to (4,1) directly.\n\nFrom (3,3), move to (4,3) on turn 9, but (4,3) no food, then on turn 10 move to (4,2) or (4,4), but (4,1) gone.\n\nSo cannot eat (4,1) either.\n\nTherefore, if I go for (1,6) first, I can only eat one food, and miss the other two.\n\nBut (4,1) might be eaten if I go directly, but from start, (4,1) is at (4,1), and from (3,3), I can't go down because (3,2) blocked.\n\nSo in left-first, I can eat (1,6) but not the others.\n\nIn up-first, I can eat (5,3) and (4,1), but not (1,6) probably.\n\n(1,6) can be eaten if I go left after eating (5,3), but it's far.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) at turn 3, positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nThen to go to (1,6), I need to go west and north.\n\nFor example, move left to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, cannot.\n\nOr move up to (5,4), then left to (4,4), etc., but it will take many turns.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)  // direction U\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,3) since tail moved? Before move: [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nMove to (5,4): no food, so head to (5,4), tail (4,3) removed, body (5,3) becomes tail, positions [(5,4),(5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5)  // direction U\n\nPositions: [(5,5),(5,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)  // direction U, but (5,6) y=6<7, ok, no obstacle\n\nPositions: [(5,6),(5,5)]\n\nBut (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so from (5,6) I need to go left to (4,6), (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle! (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo cannot go to (3,6).\n\nFrom (5,6) I can go left to (4,6), then to (3,6) blocked, or to (4,5) but (4,5) is also obstacle! (4,5) internal obstacle.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: left to (4,6), down to (5,5) but body, or up to (5,7) wall, or right to (6,6).\n\nSo move to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nSay move to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), to (3,6) blocked, to (4,5) blocked, to (4,7) wall, to (5,6) body, so only down to (4,5)? Blocked, or left to (3,6) blocked, no, (4,6) surrounded? Moves: U (4,7) wall, D (4,5) obstacle, L (3,6) obstacle, R (5,6) body, so no possible move, stuck!\n\nIf I go to (6,6) from (5,6), similar issue.\n\nFrom (5,6) move to (6,6), then from (6,6), can go down to (6,5) or left to (5,6) body, etc., but (1,6) is far and blocked by obstacles.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (1,6) after being at (5,3).\n\nTherefore, in the up-first option, I can eat (5,3) and (4,1) but not (1,6).\n\nIn left-first, I can eat (1,6) but not the others.\n\nBut (4,1) can be eaten in up-first, as I described earlier.\n\nIn up-first, I eat (5,3) at turn 3, then (4,1) at turn 6, so two foods.\n\nIn left-first, only one food.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) has the same value, so eating two is better.\n\nBut is there a way to eat all three? Probably not with the obstacles and time.\n\nPerhaps from start, I can go to (4,1) directly, but from (3,3), I can't go down, and no path.\n\nSo for maximizing, up-first allows me to eat two foods, left-first only one.\n\nTherefore, I should choose to move up at turn 0.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail reward danger, but currently no issue.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating two foods, I have length 3, and I need to survive, but with no more food, I can just move around.\n\nBut there might be other foods later? No, only these three given, and no new food mentioned, so only these.\n\nThe state has only these food items.\n\nSo I should aim to eat as many as possible.\n\nWith up-first, I can eat two.\n\nBut in the left-first, only one.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nThen for turn 0, move U to (3,4).\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAnswer format: for turn t1=0, action on turn 0, then turn 1, etc.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 0.\n\nIn the plan, I can outline the sequence.\n\nFrom above, in up-first path:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)  // to go towards (5,3)\n\nBut from (4,4), I could go other ways, but to (5,3), moving down to (4,3) is efficient.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3) eat\n\nThen to (4,1):\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)  // from (5,3) direction R, move D down\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (4,1) eat\n\nThen after that, I can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can move up to (4,2), since (4,2) free.\n\nThen to (4,3) or (3,2) blocked, etc.\n\nBut no more food, so for survival, I can go to open areas.\n\nBut since I need to output only for a few turns, but the answer should have actions for turn 0,1,2,... up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nProbably for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 0 to turn 6 I have actions.\n\nBut let's see the immediate actions.\n\nSince at turn 0, I need to choose action.\n\nI think moving U is better.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4), then on turn 1, I move to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), all safe.\n\nThen to (5,2), (5,1), (4,1).\n\nNow, when moving to (4,1), it has food, so I eat and grow.\n\nBut after that, positions [(4,1),(5,1),(5,2)]\n\nThen I can move up to (4,2), for example.\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nThen from there, to (4,3) or (3,2) blocked, etc.\n\nBut no danger.\n\nIn the left move, if I go to (2,3), then I might be trapped or something, but in this grid, from (2,3) I can go to (1,3), then up to (1,4), etc., but as before, I can only eat one food.\n\nSo for maximizing, U is better.\n\nMoreover, for the output, I can provide actions for turns 0 to 5, for example.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nThen turn 1: R to (4,4)\n\nBut I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nSince the future depends, but for now, I can plan the sequence to eat the foods.\n\nBut in the answer, I should output the actions I would take.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, I move U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on the state, but since I need to think ahead, I can simulate.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nSince the state might change, but here no new food, so it should be ok.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,6) might be eaten if I go left, but since I miss the other, worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (4,1) first, but from start, I can't directly.\n\nSo I think U is the way.\n\nThen for actions:\n\nTurn 0: move U\n\nNow, after that, on turn 1, from (3,4), I need to move.\n\nI can move R to (4,4) as planned.\n\nBut let's list the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)  // direction R\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)  // direction D\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) eat  // direction R\n\nNow, at turn 3, I ate, so positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nFor turn 4, I need to go towards (4,1), so move D to (5,2)  // from (5,3) direction R, move D down\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,1)  // direction D\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (4,1) eat\n\nBut turn 6 is beyond 5 turns from turn 0.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide up to turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at (5,1), about to move to (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nBut for the sequence, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from turn 0.\n\nI can output for turn 0 to, say, turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut let's see the food life span: all 10, so no rush.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother option: from (3,4), I could go left or up, but to reach (5,3), going right is better.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), I could go to (1,6), but as before, difficult.\n\nBut since (1,6) is far, and I can eat two nearby, better.\n\nMoreover, in the sequence above, by turn 5, I am at (5,1), which is near (4,1), so I can eat on next turn.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D  // to (5,2)\n\nTurn 5: D  // to (5,1)\n\nThen on turn 6, move L to eat (4,1), but not in the sequence.\n\nSince the answer format doesn't specify how many turns to output, I can do 5 turns or so.\n\nBut to think 5+ turns ahead, I need to consider the plan.\n\nPerhaps for now, output the actions for turn 0 and immediate future.\n\nI think moving U at turn 0 is best.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output for turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at (5,1), safe.\n\nIf I move L at turn 0, to (2,3), then turn 1 to (1,3), turn 2 to (1,4), etc., but I only get one food.\n\nSo worse.\n\nTherefore, I go with U.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this plan, when I eat (4,1), the head is at (4,1), and the tail is at (5,2)? Before eating, positions [(5,1),(5,2)] head (5,1), move to (4,1), which is not adjacent to tail (5,2)? (4,1) and (5,2) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (4,1) and (5,1) share side, but (5,1) is not tail, tail is (5,2).\n\nPositions before move to (4,1): head (5,1), tail (5,2)\n\n(5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut when I move to (4,1), the head moves to (4,1), which is adjacent to (5,1) but (5,1) is not the tail, it's the head position before move.\n\nAfter move, tail is (5,1) or something.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (4,1), not on the tail.\n\nThe tail is (5,2), which has no food.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nOnly if the tail segment has food on it, and head is adjacent, then eating that food causes collision.\n\nBut here, no food on tail.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, in all cases.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nNow for turn 4, from (5,3) with body at (4,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 5: move D to (5,1)\n\nI can include that.\n\nSince after turn 3, I need to go down.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 5.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nBut on turn 5, move to (5,1)\n\nThen later to (4,1).\n\nBut in the boxed answer.\n\nNow, the snake head direction changes, but I think it's ok.\n\nTo be complete.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 0):**\n- Snake position: Head at (3,3), no body segments (length 1).\n- Snake direction: Left (L).\n- Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacles at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n- Food:\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 9).\n  - (4,1): value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 9).\n  - (1,6): value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 9).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- Movement: Cannot reverse direction instantly (current direction L, so cannot move R on turn 0).\n- Possible moves from (3,3):\n  - Up (U) to (3,4): Safe (not wall or obstacle).\n  - Down (D) to (3,2): Blocked (internal obstacle).\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Safe (not wall or obstacle).\n  - Right (R): Forbidden (opposite direction).\n- Only valid moves: U or L.\n\n**Long-Term Planning (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival. All food has value +1, so prioritize eating multiple foods quickly. However, (1,6) is distant and blocked by obstacles, making it high-risk/low-reward compared to (5,3) and (4,1).\n- **Path to (5,3) and (4,1) is efficient**:\n  - Eat (5,3) by turn 3: Path (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (5,3).\n  - Then eat (4,1) by turn 6: Path (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,1).\n  - This sequence eats two foods by turn 6 with minimal risk (no body collisions initially, and path avoids obstacles).\n- **Path to (1,6) is inefficient and risky**:\n  - Requires ~4 turns to eat (e.g., (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) by turn 4).\n  - After eating, snake is trapped near borders/obstacles (e.g., at (1,6), only move is right to (2,6), then limited options).\n  - Cannot reach (5,3) or (4,1) before they expire (turn 9), resulting in only one food eaten.\n- **Risk Assessment**:\n  - After eating first food, length becomes 2, but no immediate collision risks.\n  - Tail reward danger: Not applicable here, as no food is on tail segments.\n  - Post-turn 6: After eating both foods, snake can navigate safely (e.g., from (4,1) move up to (4,2)) to avoid dead ends.\n- **Why U at turn 0?** Moving U starts the efficient path to (5,3) and (4,1), yielding +2 score. Moving L leads to only +1 score and poor survival due to limited mobility.\n\n**Planned Sequence (Turns 0-5):**\n- **Turn 0**: Move U to (3,4) — Begin path toward (5,3). New direction: U.\n- **Turn 1**: Move R to (4,4) — Continue toward (5,3). New direction: R.\n- **Turn 2**: Move D to (4,3) — Position to access (5,3). New direction: D.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (5,3) — Eat food (+1 score, length=2). New positions: head (5,3), body (4,3). New direction: R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move D to (5,2) — Start path to (4,1). New direction: D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (5,1) — Approach (4,1). New direction: D. (On turn 6, move L to (4,1) to eat second food.)\n\nThis sequence ensures two foods are eaten by turn 6 with no collisions. Beyond turn 5, move to (4,1) and then to open areas (e.g., (4,2)) for survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: R \\\\\nTurn 2: D \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D\n}",
