        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles.\n\n**Grid Size**: From the wall description, border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are given: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\n**Snake Positions**: Only one segment: [(3,3)]. That means the snake is just the head at (3,3), no body yet. Since it's a single segment, there's no body to collide with except itself, but with one cell, it can't collide. Also, the head direction is \"L\", which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\n**Food**: Three pieces of food, all with value +1 and life span 10. So they're all positive food. Positions:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 10\n\n- (2,5) with life span 10\n\n- (2,1) with life span 10\n\nSince it's turn 0, and life span decreases every turn including current, after turn 0, life span will be 9 for all, but I need to think about when they disappear.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, eating any food will make it grow to two segments. But I need to be careful, especially with the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide immediately after eating.\n\nBut in this case, since there's no tail yet, that shouldn't be an issue right now. After eating the first food, the tail will be where the head was, and it will move, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to decide where to move on turn 0.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3), direction L, so moving left means to (2,3)? Let me confirm coordinates.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But since y=0 and y=7 are borders, and y increases up or down?\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that probably means y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (0,7) is top-left, etc. Let me confirm.\n\nIn the food positions, we have (6,2), (2,5), (2,1). Assuming y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so (2,1) is low y, so bottom, (2,5) higher, etc.\n\nSimilarly, snake at (3,3), which is center-left or something.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (3,3) is roughly center.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3) with current direction L.\n\nI can move U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse. Current direction is L, so reverse would be R. So I cannot move R on this turn because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R (right, x+1) since that's reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving L is continuing left, U and D are perpendicular, R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible actions:\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\n- R: not allowed\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are free of walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nSo for (3,4): is it a wall or obstacle? x=3,y=4. Not border, not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): x=3,y=2. Not border, not in obstacles. (4,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is different.\n\n(2,3): x=2,y=3. Not border, not in obstacles.\n\nAll possible moves are to free cells.\n\nNow, there's no food at these positions. Food is at (6,2), (2,5), (2,1). None of the adjacent cells have food, so I can't eat food immediately.\n\n(2,3) is close to (2,5) and (2,1), but not adjacent; (2,5) is two units away in y-direction.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead to reach food.\n\nSince all food has life span 10, I have time, but I should head towards one.\n\nAlso, with only one segment, there's no body collision risk, so I can move freely except for walls.\n\nBut after eating, I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\n- F1: (6,2) - bottom-right, since y=2 low\n\n- F2: (2,5) - top-left, y=5 high\n\n- F3: (2,1) - bottom-left, y=1 low\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nI should go towards the closest food or something.\n\nBut I need to think about the path and potential risks.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I need to find a safe path.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, and I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nBut for now, no body.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nInternal obstacles:\n\n(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nList by coordinate:\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nSnake: (3,3)\n\nFood: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1)\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (3,4), (3,2), or (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is closer to F3 (2,1) and F2 (2,5), both at x=2.\n\n(3,2) is closer to F1 (6,2), same y=2.\n\nBut (6,2) is at x=6, so from (3,2) it's 3 steps right, but I need to consider obstacles.\n\nPath to (2,1): from (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1), but (2,2) is free? Check obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free. Similarly, (2,1) is food, but I need to move to it.\n\n(2,1) is food position, so if I go to (2,1), I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 0, I need to choose an action.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail will be at the position where I ate, but since it's the first food, after eating, the snake will have head and one body segment.\n\nLet's think about which food to target first.\n\nF3 (2,1) is at (2,1), which is close, only two moves away if I go left then down or something.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I go L to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2), then D to (2,1) to eat on turn 2.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) on turn 0, then turn 1 to (2,2), turn 2 to (2,1) eat.\n\nSimilarly, F2 (2,5) from (2,3) U to (2,4) then U to (2,5), but (2,4) is free? Obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, (2,4) not listed, so free. (2,5) is food, but (1,5) is obstacle, but (2,5) should be free.\n\n(2,5) is food position, so it's not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, F1 (6,2) is farther.\n\nAlso, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut let's check if there are any immediate risks. No.\n\nNow, after eating, say I eat F3 at (2,1) on turn 2.\n\nOn turn 2, head moves to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it, length becomes 2, so body is at previous position, which was (2,2) before moving? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAssume:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3). Snake positions: head at (2,3), body? Initially only head, so after move, positions: [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2). Positions: [(2,2), (2,3)]? No.\n\nSnake positions are stored as list, head first.\n\nInitially: [(3,3)]\n\nAfter turn 0, move L to (2,3): new positions [(2,3)] since no body, just head moved.\n\nThen turn 1: move D to (2,2): now head at (2,2), and since no growth, body? But when it moves, the tail moves, but since no body, only head moves to (2,2), positions [(2,2)]\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nWith only one segment, when it moves, the head moves to new position, and there is no tail, so positions become [new head] only, since no body.\n\nAfter eating, it grows.\n\nIn this case, until I eat, the snake remains length 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn 0: start at (3,3), move to (2,3), positions: [(2,3)]\n\n- Turn 1: from (2,3), move to (2,2), positions: [(2,2)]\n\n- Turn 2: from (2,2), move to (2,1), which has food, so eat, length becomes 2, so positions: head at (2,1), body at (2,2). So [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nNow, direction: when I move to (2,1) from (2,2), I moved down, so head direction D.\n\nNow, on turn 3, I can move from (2,1).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is the body, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\nCannot move U to (2,2).\n\nD to (2,0), but y=0 is border wall, so cannot, death.\n\nL to (1,1), or R to (3,1), but need to check if free.\n\n(1,1): not border, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): not border, obstacles: (4,1) is obstacle, (3,1) not listed, free.\n\nBut if I move L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n\nBut moving U to body or D to wall both death.\n\nAlso, cannot move reverse? Current direction is D (since I moved down to (2,1)), so reverse would be U, which is to body, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: L or R.\n\nBut if I move L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) might be safe, but let's see.\n\nAfter moving, the body moves: head to new position, tail moves off if no growth, but with growth, tail stays.\n\nIn this case, after eating on turn 2, positions [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3: if I move, say L to (1,1), then head to (1,1), and since no food eaten, tail moves off (2,2), so positions: [(1,1), (2,1)]\n\nSimilarly, if R to (3,1), positions [(3,1), (2,1)]\n\nNow, (1,1) or (3,1) both seem free.\n\nBut at (1,1), I need to be careful of obstacles.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle above, but (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has food eaten, so no food there now.\n\nBut there is another food at (2,5), which is above.\n\nBut from (1,1) or (3,1), I need to go to other places.\n\nThe problem is that after eating at (2,1), I'm trapped at the bottom with walls and obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), if I go to (1,1), then from (1,1), I can move U to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nL to (0,1), but x=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,0), y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nR to (1,1) is current, or to (2,1) but that's body? From (1,1), possible moves: U (1,2) obstacle, D (1,0) wall, L (0,1) wall, R (2,1) which is where the body is, but after moving, the body might have moved.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAfter turn 3, if at [(1,1), (2,1)], head at (1,1), direction say L or whatever.\n\nThen turn 4: from (1,1), move U? (1,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nD? (1,0) wall, cannot.\n\nL? (0,1) wall, cannot.\n\nR? to (2,1), which is the body segment.\n\nIf I move to (2,1), which is occupied by the body, so collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, all directions blocked except R to (2,1) but it's body, so death.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) instead.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1), positions [(3,1), (2,1)]\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,2), but (3,2) free? Obstacles: (4,2) is obstacle, (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, cannot.\n\nL to (2,1), which is body, collision.\n\nR to (4,1), but (4,1) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,2)\n\nOr L to (2,1) body, death.\n\nOr D/R not possible.\n\nSo only U to (3,2)\n\nThen move to (3,2), positions: head to (3,2), tail moves off (2,1)? After move, if no eat, tail moves, so positions [(3,2), (3,1)]? Head at (3,2), body at (3,1)\n\nInitially [(3,1), (2,1)]\n\nAfter moving U to (3,2), head to (3,2), and tail moves from (2,1) to? When moving, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food, tail is removed, so new positions: head at (3,2), and the body segment that was at (3,1) remains, but since it was one body, now head at (3,2), body at (3,1)? Let's think of the list.\n\nBefore move: positions [(3,1), (2,1)] with head at (3,1), body at (2,1)\n\nAfter moving U to (3,2): head moves to (3,2), and the tail (2,1) is removed, so the body segment (3,1) becomes the new tail? The segments: after moving, the body follows, so the segment that was at (3,1) is now the tail, and head at (3,2), so positions: [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow at (3,2), which is free.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut back to the point: if I eat at (2,1), I end up in a position where from (2,1), I have limited moves and almost got stuck, but I can go to (3,1) and then up.\n\nBut (3,2) is near center, I can go to other food.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better first food to eat.\n\nF2 (2,5) at top.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I go to (2,3) turn 0, then U to (2,4) turn 1, then U to (2,5) eat turn 2.\n\nOn turn 2, head to (2,5), eat, length 2, positions: [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), but (2,6) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nD to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, collision.\n\nL to (1,5), but (1,5) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nR to (3,5), is (3,5) free? Not border, obstacles: (4,6) etc, (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSo only possible move R to (3,5).\n\nThen positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to other places.\n\n(3,5) is near center.\n\nF1 (6,2) is far, and at bottom.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom (3,3), I could go to (3,2) or (3,4) or (2,3).\n\n(3,4) is up, which might be towards F2.\n\nBut F2 is at (2,5), so from (3,4) I need to go left and up.\n\nBut let's think about the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nSo the left side x=1 has obstacles at y=2,4,5, so it's partially blocked.\n\nSimilarly, bottom has (4,1), (4,2) at x=4.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to have space to move.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going to corners early.\n\nF3 (2,1) is near bottom-left, which has walls and obstacles.\n\nF2 (2,5) is near top-left, with obstacles at (1,5) and (2,6).\n\nF1 (6,2) is bottom-right, with no obstacles listed near it except borders.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2, internal obstacles not near, except (4,1), (4,2) at x=4,y=1-2, but (6,2) is at x=6, so different.\n\nPath to F1: from (3,3), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut current direction L, so I cannot move R immediately.\n\nOn turn 0, I cannot move R because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo I have to move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), or D to (3,2), or L to (2,3).\n\nIf I want to go to F1, I should move down to (3,2), then from there, I can move right, etc.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns.\n\nSince all food has value +1, I can eat any, but I need to survive to eat more.\n\nAlso, after eating one, I grow, and the tail can have food under it, but only if food spawns under body, which might not happen immediately.\n\nThe food positions are given, no new food mentioned, so only these three for now, but life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\nBut I can eat multiple.\n\nBut for now, let's decide turn 0 action.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards F2 (2,5) or F1 (6,2).\n\nF3 seems risky as we saw.\n\nAnother option: from (3,3), move U to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), or L to (2,4), or R to (4,4), etc.\n\n(2,4) is free, as per earlier.\n\nThen to F2 (2,5), I can go from (3,4) L to (2,4), then U to (2,5) eat.\n\nBut from (3,3) to (3,4) U, then (2,4) L, then (2,5) U eat on turn 2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) L, then (2,4) U, then (2,5) U eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut as before, after eating at (2,5), I can only move R to (3,5), then from there I have more options.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to other food or explore.\n\nF1 at (6,2) and F3 at (2,1).\n\nF3 might be eaten soon or not.\n\nBut life span 10, so I have time.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go to F1.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), I can move L, R, D, U, but not reverse? Current direction: after moving D to (3,2), direction D.\n\nSo from (3,2), can move L to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1), U to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is previous position, but since no body, it's free.\n\n(4,2) is obstacle? (4,2) is in internal obstacles, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,1) is free, (2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nBut U to (3,3) is reverse? Current direction D, so U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot move U.\n\nPossible: L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot, D to (3,1), or U not allowed.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nIf move L to (2,2), or D to (3,1).\n\nThen to go to F1 (6,2), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I move D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, cannot, L to (2,1), D to (3,0) wall, U to (3,2) reverse not allowed if direction D.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) from (3,2) with D, direction D, so from (3,1), U to (3,2) is reverse, not allowed.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move L to (2,1), which is food, so I can eat it if I go there.\n\nBut earlier we saw that eating at (2,1) might be risky.\n\nIf from (3,2) I move L to (2,2), then from (2,2) I can move to (2,1) or (2,3) etc.\n\nBut let's not go to F3 yet.\n\nPerhaps I should go to F1 first.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2) turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nIf I move L to (2,2), then turn 2, from (2,2) I can move R to (3,2), but (3,2) is previous? Positions: after turn 0, at (3,2) alone.\n\nTurn 1 move L to (2,2), positions [(2,2)]\n\nTurn 2, from (2,2), move to (2,1) D, or (2,3) U, or (1,2) L but (1,2) obstacle, cannot, or (3,2) R.\n\n(3,2) is free, but if I move R to (3,2), no food.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) obstacle? Cannot, U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2) reverse not allowed.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) from (2,2) with R, direction R, so from (3,2), L to (2,2) reverse not allowed, R to (4,2) obstacle, U to (3,3), D to (3,1).\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nU to (3,3), or D to (3,1).\n\nIf U, back to start, not good.\n\nD to (3,1), then as before, only to (2,1).\n\nSo it seems difficult to go right from (3,2) because of the obstacle at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go to x=4 from left at y=2.\n\nTo go to F1 (6,2), I need to go via other rows.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I could go down to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (2,1), but that's F3.\n\nOr from (3,3) go to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nLet's list all internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nSo at y=2, (1,2) and (4,2) are obstacles, so cells (2,2), (3,2), (5,2), (6,2) are free, but (4,2) blocked, so I can go from (3,2) to (2,2) or to (3,1) or (3,3), but not to (4,2).\n\nTo go right, I need to go up or down first.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move U to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4), since (4,4) free? Not obstacle, not border.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), etc, down to (5,2) or something to reach (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nBut let's see the path to F1.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4) U turn 0.\n\nTurn 1, from (3,4), move R to (4,4) (since direction U, R is perpendicular, allowed).\n\nThen turn 2, from (4,4), move R to (5,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I can go to (5,4) then (5,3), (5,2), then (6,2).\n\n(5,2) free? Not obstacle, (5,2) should be free.\n\nObstacles: (5,6) at top, not (5,2).\n\nSo possible.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,4) R, then to (5,3) D, then to (5,2) D, then to (6,2) R.\n\nBut on turn 2 at (4,4), move to (5,4), then turn 3 to (5,3), turn 4 to (5,2), turn 5 to (6,2) eat.\n\nSo 5 turns to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nBut I need to start with turn 0.\n\nAnother option: go to F2 first, which is closer.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) L turn 0.\n\nTurn 1 to (2,4) U, turn 2 to (2,5) U eat.\n\nThen as before, turn 3 to (3,5) R.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, to F1 (6,2), I can go down and right.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,5) R, then to (5,5) R, but (5,5) free? Obstacles (5,6), but (5,5) free, then to (5,4) D, (5,3) D, (5,2) D, then (6,2) R.\n\nBut (5,6) obstacle, but (5,5) ok.\n\nBut from (3,5) to (4,5) turn 3, (5,5) turn 4, (5,4) turn 5, (5,3) turn 6, (5,2) turn 7, (6,2) turn 8 eat.\n\nBut life span 10, turn 0 to turn 8 is 8 turns, life span decreases to 2, still there if not eaten.\n\nBut I can eat F3 on the way or something.\n\nF3 at (2,1), which is bottom-left.\n\nFrom (3,5), I could go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc, to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) might be eaten earlier or not.\n\nSince I'm planning, I should choose a sequence that allows me to eat multiple food safely.\n\nBut for turn 0, I need to decide.\n\nAlso, the \"Tail Reward Danger\" is not an issue yet.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but only these three are present, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the center or open area.\n\nBut let's list the available moves for turn 0.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction L, can move U, D, L.\n\n- U to (3,4): then I can go to F2 or to F1 via right.\n\n- D to (3,2): then I can go to F3 or to F1 if I go right, but blocked at x=4 y=2, so need to go via other y.\n\n- L to (2,3): then to F2 or F3.\n\nF2 (2,5) is at y=5, F3 (2,1) at y=1.\n\nGoing to F3 might trap me, as earlier simulation.\n\nGoing to F2 is better, as I can escape to the right.\n\nF1 is also open.\n\nBut F2 is closer.\n\nDistance to F2: from (3,3) to (2,5), delta x=1, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 3, can reach in 2 moves as above.\n\nTo F3: (3,3) to (2,1), delta x=1, delta y=2, distance 3, 2 moves.\n\nTo F1: (3,3) to (6,2), delta x=3, delta y=1, distance 4, at least 4 moves.\n\nBut with obstacles, might be more.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, and the grid has obstacles on the left, it might be better to go right to open area.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4) turn 0, then I can go right to (4,4), (5,4), etc, which has fewer obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles are mostly on left: x=1 and x=4.\n\nx=4 has (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), so at y=1,2,6.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 at x=4 are free.\n\nSimilarly, x=5 only (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo the right side is more open.\n\nLeft side has multiple obstacles.\n\nSo for long-term survival, heading right might be better.\n\nThen I can eat F1 first or later.\n\nBut F1 is at (6,2), which is bottom-right.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4) to go up.\n\nOr move D to (3,2) to go down.\n\nBut to go right, I need to change direction.\n\nOn turn 0, I can move U or D to set up for right move.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,4) turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4), direction U (since moved up), so I can move R to (4,4) (not reverse, perpendicular).\n\nThen from there, I can go to F1 or other.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,2), then from (3,2) direction D, I can move R to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot, so I can only move L or D, which might lead to F3.\n\nSo moving D might force me left.\n\nMoving U allows me to go right.\n\nMoving L also to left.\n\nSo for long-term, moving U might be best, to go to open area.\n\nThen I can eat F2 later or not.\n\nF2 is at (2,5), which is left-top, but I can eat it on the way or something.\n\nSince life span 10, I can eat F1 first.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), move R to (4,4) (direction now R)\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 3: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) (direction R, D perpendicular)\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2), move R to (6,2) eat F1.\n\nNow, during this, on turn 5, I eat at (6,2), so snake grows to length 2.\n\nPositions: before turn 5, at turn 4, positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 0: start (3,3), move U to (3,4), positions [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4), positions [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), positions [(5,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3), positions [(5,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), positions [(5,2)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,2), which has food, eat, so positions [(6,2), (5,2)] head at (6,2), body at (5,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, from (6,2), I can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse of R is L, but L is left, which is not reverse? Current direction R, so reverse is L? Let's see.\n\nDirections: if moving right, reverse is left.\n\nBut I cannot move opposite on next turn, but after eating, I can move.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,3)\n\nD to (6,1) but y=1, not border, but (6,1) free? No obstacles listed.\n\nL to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision.\n\nR to (7,2) but x=7 border, wall, cannot.\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nCannot L to body.\n\nSo U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nSay move U to (6,3).\n\nThen positions: head to (6,3), tail moves off (5,2)? No food, so tail removed, positions [(6,3), (6,2)]? Head at (6,3), body at (6,2)\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I have other food to eat, like F2 at (2,5) and F3 at (2,1).\n\nLife span: on turn 0, life span 10, each turn decreases, so on turn 5, 5 turns passed, life span left: 10-5=5 for all food? Life span decreases every turn including current, but when eaten?\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nOn turn t, food has life_span, after turn t, life_span decreases by 1, so on turn 0, life_span=10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, after turn 1, 8, and so on, until 0, disappears.\n\nWhen I move to a cell with food, I eat it on that turn.\n\nIn this case, F1 eaten on turn 5, so it was there.\n\nSimilarly, F2 and F3, on turn 5, life span left: started 10, after 5 turns (t0 to t4), decreased to 5, then on t5 I eat F1, F2 and F3 still there with life span 5, decrease to 4 after t5.\n\nSo I can go to eat them.\n\nBut F2 at (2,5) is far, and I'm at (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, F3 at (2,1).\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take time.\n\nFrom the right, I can go up to (6,3), (6,4), etc, then left to (5,4), (4,4), etc, to (2,5) or something.\n\nBut (2,6) obstacle, so need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (6,3) to (6,4) U, (6,5) U, but (6,5) free, then to (5,5) L, (4,5) L, (3,5) L, (2,5) L but (2,5) is food, but from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, but (2,5) might be reachable.\n\nBut (1,5) obstacle, but (2,5) ok.\n\nBut it would take many turns.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go back.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nFor turn 0, I think moving U to (3,4) is a good start to head to open area.\n\nI could move to (2,3) to eat F2 quickly.\n\nThen from there go right.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat F2, positions [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) (only choice, as before)\n\nPositions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), move R to (4,5) (direction now R)\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nThen I can go down to F1.\n\nTurn 6: to (5,4) D, turn 7: to (5,3) D, turn 8: to (5,2) D, turn 9: to (6,2) R eat.\n\nOn turn 9, life span: started 10, after 9 turns, life span 1, decrease to 0 after turn, but I eat on turn 9, so it's there, then after eaten, disappears.\n\nAfter turn t, life span decreases, so on turn t, before action, food has life_span, after I move and eat, then after turn, life span decreases for remaining food.\n\nBut when I eat, it's consumed, so no problem.\n\nF1 eaten on turn 9, with life span 1 before decrease? Let's clarify.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has life_span L.\n\nAfter I move, if I eat, I consume it.\n\nThen, after the turn, life_span decreases for all remaining food.\n\nSo for F1, on turn 9, start with life_span 1, I move to it and eat, so consumed.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn 9, life_span becomes 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this sequence, F1 eaten on turn 9, F2 on turn 2.\n\nF3 at (2,1) might not be eaten, but I can go there.\n\nBut with the snake growing, it might be tight.\n\nIn the first sequence, going to F1 directly, I eat on turn 5, then have time for others.\n\nBut F2 and F3 are on the left, might be harder to reach.\n\nPerhaps eat F2 first quickly, then go to F1.\n\nFor turn 0, since I need to output action for turn 0, and think ahead.\n\nAnother idea: move to (2,3) and then to (2,1) to eat F3, but we saw it might be risky.\n\nBut with one segment, eating at (2,1) on turn 2, positions [(2,1), (2,2)] as before.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: eat at (2,1), positions [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1), positions [(3,1), (2,1)] (head to (3,1), tail from (2,2) to? Move to (3,1), no eat, so tail removed, positions [(3,1), (2,1)]? Head at (3,1), body at (2,1)\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), direction R (since moved right), can move U to (3,2), or D to (3,0) wall cannot, L to (2,1) body, R to (4,1) obstacle cannot.\n\nSo only U to (3,2)\n\nPositions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2) obstacle cannot, D to (3,1) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay U to (3,3), positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nThen I'm back, and I can go to other food.\n\nBut F2 at (2,5) is still there, I can go up.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4) U, etc.\n\nBut it's doable, but I wasted turns.\n\nSo better not to go to F3 first.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, I think the best is to either move U to (3,4) to go to open area, or move L to (2,3) to eat F2 quickly.\n\nSince long-term survival is key, and left has obstacles, moving U to (3,4) might be better to access the right side.\n\nThen I can eat F1, and perhaps F2 if I go back, but F2 might expire or be hard to reach.\n\nLife span 10, I have time.\n\nAfter eating F1 on turn 5, I can go to F2.\n\nFrom (6,2) after eating, I can move U to (6,3), then U to (6,4), U to (6,5), then L to (5,5), L to (4,5), L to (3,5), then to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,5) L.\n\nBut (2,5) might be eaten earlier or not.\n\nIn this case, if I go to F1 first, F2 might not be eaten, but on turn 5, F2 life span: started 10, after 5 turns, 5 left, then I go to it.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (2,5), Manhattan distance |6-2| + |2-5| =4+3=7, so at least 7 moves, but with snake body, it might take more.\n\nOn turn 5 at (6,2), move to (6,3) turn 6, (6,4) turn 7, (6,5) turn 8, (5,5) turn 9, (4,5) turn 10, (3,5) turn 11, (2,5) turn 12 eat.\n\nOn turn 12, F2 life span: started 10, after 12 turns? After turn 12, life span decreases to 0, but on turn 12 start, life span is 10-12? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 0 start, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, life span 9\n\nAfter turn 1, 8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, life span = 10 - k\n\nOn turn t start, life span is 10 - t\n\nBecause after t turns, decreased by t.\n\nAt turn t, before action, food has life_span = initial - t\n\nThen after move, if eat, consumed.\n\nThen after turn, life span decreases for remaining.\n\nSo for F2, on turn t, if t <= 9, life_span = 10 - t >=1, so present.\n\nOn turn 10, life_span = 10-10=0, so at turn 10 start, life_span 0, so it disappears before the turn, I think.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from spawn, it is gone.\n\nTypically, if life_span L, it disappears when life_span reaches 0.\n\nAt turn t, after the turn, life_span decreases, and if 0, disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, before action, food is present if life_span > 0.\n\nAfter I move, if I eat, ok.\n\nAfter turn, life_span decreases, and if 0, removed.\n\nSo for F2, on turn t, if 10 - t > 0, i.e., t < 10, it is present at turn t start.\n\nOn turn 10, life_span = 10-10=0, so before turn 10, it disappears, so not present on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 9, life_span = 10-9=1, present, after turn 9, decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo to eat F2, I need to do it by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the sequence where I eat F2 on turn 2, it's fine.\n\nIf I go to F1 first, eat on turn 5, then to eat F2, I need to reach by turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 5 at (6,2), to (2,5) in 4 turns? Impossible, distance 7, minimum 7 turns.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 4 turns, can move 4 steps, but |6-2|=4, |2-5|=3, so at least 7 moves, cannot reach in 4 turns.\n\nSo if I eat F1 on turn 5, I cannot eat F2 because it disappears after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, F3 disappears after turn 9.\n\nBut F3 at (2,1) might be closer from some positions.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (2,1), |6-2| + |2-1| =4+1=5, so 5 moves, from turn 5 to turn 9: turns 6,7,8,9,10? Turn 5 I'm at (6,2), after eating.\n\nTurn 6: move to say (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: to (6,4) or something, but to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, not free.\n\nPositions after turn 5: [(6,2), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (6,3), positions [(6,3), (6,2)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,4), positions [(6,4), (6,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (6,5), positions [(6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTurn 9: move L to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (6,5)] but not to (2,1).\n\nTo go to (2,1), I need to go left, but I'm at (6,5), far.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) if possible, then left.\n\nBut (6,1) free, then to (5,1), (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, cannot, so need to go up.\n\nIt's messy, and I can't reach F2 or F3 in time if I eat F1 first.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat F2 or F3 first, which are closer and on the left, then go to F1.\n\nF3 might be risky, so eat F2 first.\n\nSo for turn 0, move L to (2,3) to head towards F2.\n\nThen as in the second sequence.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat F2\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen from there, I can go to F1.\n\nF1 at (6,2), life span 10, I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 3 at (3,5), to (6,2), I can go.\n\nFor example, turn 3: at (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,2) eat F1.\n\nOn turn 8, eat F1, life span 10-8=2, present.\n\nF3 at (2,1) can be eaten if I go, but not necessary, or if I have time.\n\nBut with the snake growing, I might not go back.\n\nSince I ate F2, and F1, I have score 2.\n\nF3 might expire, but I can ignore if not reachable.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 8 at (6,2), I can go to other places.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAfter eating F2 on turn 2, I have a body, but I moved to (3,5) safely.\n\nThen to F1.\n\nNow for turn 0, action: move L to (2,3)\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state is at turn 0, and I output for turn 0, turn 1, etc., up to some turns.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I should output a sequence of actions starting from turn 0.\n\nSince it's a plan, but I need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut the future turns depend on the state, so I should plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nSince no new food spawns mentioned, and no other changes, I can plan a fixed sequence.\n\nBut food might be eaten, so the state changes.\n\nIn this case, after I eat food, it disappears.\n\nSo for the plan, I can assume I follow the path.\n\nSo for turn 0: move L\n\nThen turn 1: from (2,3), move U to (2,4) (since I want to go to (2,5))\n\nBut on turn 1, from (2,3), I could move other directions, but I plan to go U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat F2\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,5)\n\nNow, from (3,5), for turn 4, I can move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 5 or so.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and t1=0, so Turn 0, Turn 1, etc.\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nIn this case, for the first few turns.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, move L.\n\nBut let's see if moving U is better.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) on turn 0, then I can go to F2 or to F1.\n\nTo F2: from (3,4) move L to (2,4) turn 1, then U to (2,5) turn 2 eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr to F1, but as we saw, I might not eat F2 later.\n\nBut if I go to F2 first from there, same as moving L first.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving L directly to (2,3) is efficient for F2.\n\nMoving U to (3,4) adds a step if I go to F2.\n\nFor example, to reach (2,3) from (3,3), moving L directly in one step.\n\nMoving U to (3,4), then to (2,4), then to (2,5), same number to F2, but I'm at (3,4) instead of (2,3) after turn 0.\n\nBut (3,4) is closer to the right.\n\nBut for eating F2, it's similar.\n\nI think moving L to (2,3) is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 0\n\n**Current State (Turn 0):**\n- **Snake Position**: Only the head at (3,3), no body segments. Length is 1.\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L), so moving left is the current direction.\n- **Possible Moves from (3,3)**:\n  - U (up) to (3,4): Free (no wall or obstacle).\n  - D (down) to (3,2): Free (no wall or obstacle).\n  - L (left) to (2,3): Free (no wall or obstacle).\n  - R (right) to (4,3): Not allowed (instant reverse from current direction L is forbidden).\n- **Food**: \n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 10 (will disappear after turn 10 if not eaten).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 10 (will disappear after turn 10).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 10 (will disappear after turn 10).\n- **Obstacles and Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). These cells are blocked.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize Survival and Score**: With the snake length 1, no immediate collision risk. Eat positive food to grow, but avoid positions that could trap the snake. The left side (low x) has multiple obstacles (e.g., at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6)), increasing risk. The right side (higher x) is more open, so head right after eating one food to access safer areas.\n- **Target Selection**: \n  - (2,5) is closest (Manhattan distance 2 from (3,3)) and can be eaten quickly (in 2 turns). Eating it first allows growth to length 2 and positions the snake to escape right.\n  - (2,1) is risky: After eating, the snake could be trapped near walls and obstacles (e.g., at (2,1), moves are limited, risking collision on subsequent turns).\n  - (6,2) is farther (distance 4) but accessible from the right side. Eat it after (2,5) to avoid missing it due to life span (must be eaten by turn 9).\n- **Life Span Consideration**: All food has life span 10. After turn 0, life span decreases to 9. To eat both (2,5) and (6,2):\n  - Eat (2,5) by turn 2 (life span 8 remaining).\n  - Eat (6,2) by turn 8 (life span 2 remaining on turn 8, eaten before it disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,1) may expire but is lower priority due to risk; ignore if not reachable safely.\n- **Path to (2,5)**: \n  - Turn 0: Move L to (2,3) to start toward (2,5).\n  - Turn 1: Move U to (2,4) (direct path to (2,5)).\n  - Turn 2: Move U to (2,5) to eat food. Snake grows to length 2 (head at (2,5), body at (2,4)).\n- **Escape Right After Eating (2,5)**:\n  - From (2,5), only safe move is R to (3,5) (turn 3) to avoid obstacles and walls.\n- **Path to (6,2) from (3,5)**:\n  - Turn 4: Move R to (4,5).\n  - Turn 5: Move R to (5,5).\n  - Turn 6: Move D to (5,4).\n  - Turn 7: Move D to (5,3).\n  - Turn 8: Move D to (5,2), then R to (6,2) to eat (but turn 8 action is D to (5,2); R to (6,2) is on turn 9—adjust below).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - After eating (2,5), moving right avoids the obstacle-rich left side.\n  - The path to (6,2) stays clear of obstacles and walls.\n  - With life span 10, (6,2) is reachable by turn 8 (life span 2 on turn 8).\n- **5-Turn Plan Focus**: Output actions for turns 0-4 as a concrete plan based on current state. Full sequence to turn 8 is considered for decision-making.\n\n**Turn-by-Turn Actions (0 to 4):**\n- Turn 0: Move L to (2,3) — direct path to (2,5).\n- Turn 1: Move U to (2,4) — continue to (2,5).\n- Turn 2: Move U to (2,5) — eat food, grow to length 2.\n- Turn 3: Move R to (3,5) — only safe move; escape right.\n- Turn 4: Move R to (4,5) — continue toward open area and path to (6,2).\n\n**Full Sequence to Eat Both Foods (Turns 0-8):**\n- Turn 5: Move R to (5,5) — head to (5,5), body follows.\n- Turn 6: Move D to (5,4) — descend toward y=2.\n- Turn 7: Move D to (5,3) — continue descent.\n- Turn 8: Move D to (5,2) — prepare to eat (6,2).\n- Turn 9: Move R to (6,2) — eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nThis plan eats two high-value foods by turn 9, maximizes score early, and ensures long-term survival by moving to safer areas. (2,1) is not targeted due to risk and life span constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 2: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the current turn is t1 = 1. The snake is at position (2,3) and it's just the head, since the positions are given as [(2,3)]. That means the snake has a length of 1, so no body segments yet.\n\nThe head direction is left (L), so the snake is facing left.\n\nNow, the walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, with walls on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all these to avoid moving into them.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,2) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (5,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and no negative food mentioned.\n\nSince the snake has length 1, eating any food will increase its length to 2. But I need to be careful with the tail reward danger later when the snake is longer.\n\nCurrent position: head at (2,3), direction L. So from (2,3), moving left would go to (1,3). But I need to check if that's valid.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,3), I can go U, D, L, R, but since current direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R, but since there's no body, reverse might not be an issue except for the rule.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So since direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid mentally. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n\nList them:\n\n- (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — all in x=1\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nNow, snake at (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\n- L: (1,3)\n\n- R: (3,3) but cannot because opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, so not allowed this turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since this is turn 1, and direction is given as L, moving R now would be instant reverse, so not allowed.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check if these cells are free.\n\nFirst, L to (1,3): is (1,3) a wall or obstacle? Walls: border x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — so (1,3) is not listed, so should be free. But (1,3) might be occupied? Snake is only at (2,3), no body, so (1,3) is empty.\n\nU to (2,4): (2,4) — not border, not in obstacles: obstacles at (2,6), but (2,4) should be free.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) — not border, obstacles: (1,2) but that's different, (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, food locations: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1), (5,1)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nSince snake length is 1, eating any food will make it longer, so I need to plan a path to eat food without getting stuck.\n\nAlso, food life span: all have high life span, 9 or 10, so not disappearing soon.\n\nCurrent turn t=1.\n\nList the grid for clarity. Make a mental grid.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles:\n\n- (1,2), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (4,1), (4,2), (4,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\nAnd (1,2) is listed, which is x=1,y=2.\n\nNow, snake at (2,3).\n\nFood: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1), (5,1)\n\n(2,5) is above, (2,1) below, (5,1) right-down, (6,2) far right.\n\nSince head is at (2,3), direction L.\n\nI need to choose a move for turn 1.\n\nOptions: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nNow, from there, I need to plan multiple steps.\n\nAlso, since snake is short, I can go for nearby food.\n\n(2,5) is at same x, y=5, so up from (2,3) to (2,4) then (2,5) but (2,5) is food, so if I go U to (2,4) on turn 1, then on turn 2 I can go U to (2,5) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is down, so D to (2,2) then D to (2,1) to eat.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so from (2,3), I need to go right and down, but right is not allowed now.\n\n(6,2) is even farther.\n\nNow, eating at (2,5) or (2,1) seems quick.\n\nBut let's think about after eating.\n\nIf I eat at (2,5), on turn 2, I move to (2,5), length becomes 2, with tail at previous position.\n\nAssume turn 1: move to (2,4), then turn 2: move to (2,5), eat food, so snake becomes head at (2,5), tail at (2,4)? Positions: after move to (2,5), the head is there, and since it ate, body segment added, so positions: [(2,5), (2,4)] or [(2,5), (2,3)]? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn 1 start: snake at [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move to new position, say (2,4). Since no food there, snake moves, head to (2,4), and since no body, it's just [(2,4)].\n\nThen turn 2: move to (2,5), which has food, so eat, head to (2,5), and body segment added at previous head position, so now snake is [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,1): turn 1 to (2,2), no food, so snake to [(2,2)], then turn 2 to (2,1), eat, snake to [(2,1), (2,2)].\n\nNow, from there, I need to move further.\n\nBut there is a risk of tail reward danger later, but for now, snake is short.\n\nAlso, food at (2,1) and (2,5) are both close.\n\n(2,1) is down, (2,5) is up.\n\nNow, looking at the obstacles, in row x=1, there are obstacles at y=2,4,5, so (1,3) might be free, but if I go left to (1,3), what's there? No food, so I need to go elsewhere to find food.\n\nGoing left might not be efficient since no food nearby except (2,1) and (2,5).\n\n(5,1) and (6,2) are farther.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake has a body, so I need to avoid colliding with it.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (2,5), snake at [(2,5),(2,4)], then I can move, say, left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) or down to (2,4) but (2,4) is the tail, so moving down to (2,4) would collide with body? But at the moment of move, the tail will move away if I move, so it might be ok.\n\nThe rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail moves away.\n\nTherefore, moving to the tail cell is safe, as long as after the move, the head doesn't collide with the new body positions.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a cell, if that cell was occupied by the tail and only the tail, then since the tail moves, it becomes free, so head can move there without collision, because at the new state, tail is elsewhere.\n\nCollision happens if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, or if it doesn't move away.\n\nBut for the tail, it's safe.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (2,5), snake [(2,5),(2,4)], head at (2,5).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), but (2,6) is an obstacle! (2,6) is listed as internal obstacle.\n\nD to (2,4), which is the tail.\n\nL to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is obstacle, so U is invalid.\n\nD to (2,4): since it's the tail, and tail will move, it should be safe.\n\nL to (1,5): is (1,5) free? (1,5) is an obstacle! Internal obstacles include (1,5), so wall.\n\nSimilarly, R to (3,5): (3,5) should be free, no obstacles listed, and not border.\n\nx=3,y=5, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,5) is within, and obstacles: (1,5) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is tail, so moving down to (2,4) is ok.\n\nBut (2,4) is not a wall, and it's the tail, so safe.\n\nNow, from (2,5), if I move D to (2,4), head moves to (2,4), and the body segment at (2,4) was tail, but since head moves to (2,4), and tail was there, but when head moves to (2,4), the body segment that was at (2,4) moves to where? Let's sequence.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,5), (2,4)] head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nMove head to (2,4). Since it moves to the tail cell, and no food there (assuming), so head moves to (2,4), then the body segment at (2,4) must move, but it was the tail, so it disappears? No.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment ahead. So the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: head moves to new position, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to old first body, and so on, tail moves to the position of the previous tail-1.\n\nIn this case, snake segments: index 0: head, index 1: body (which is also tail since length 2).\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,4), which was the position of segment 1. Then segment 1 (the tail) must move to where? But the head is moving to its position, so segment 1 should move to the old position of segment 0, which is (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is where the head was.\n\nSo new positions: head at (2,4), and body at (2,5). So snake is now [(2,4), (2,5)].\n\nAnd since no food at (2,4), length same.\n\nBut now head is at (2,4), which was previously body, but after move, it's head, and body is at (2,5).\n\nNow, from here, I can move again.\n\nBut back to choosing where to go from start.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,1) first.\n\nBut let's consider the options for turn 1.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,4) on turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (2,5), eat food, snake becomes [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nThen from there, as above, I can move D to (2,4) or L, R, but U is obstacle, L to (1,5) is obstacle, so only D or R.\n\nD to (2,4): as above, after move, head to (2,4), body to (2,5), so positions [(2,4), (2,5)].\n\nR to (3,5): head to (3,5), body to (2,5)? Before move: [(2,5),(2,4)], move head to (3,5), no food, so head to (3,5), body segment moves to old head position (2,5), so snake [(3,5), (2,5)].\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\nFood at (2,1) is below.\n\nIf I go D on turn 1 to (2,2), then turn 2 to (2,1), eat, snake [(2,1),(2,2)].\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2) which is tail, so safe; D to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid; L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1): is it free? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed, so should be free, but x=1,y=1, border walls are at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,1) is not border, and not in internal list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) should be free.\n\nBut (2,0) is y=0, wall.\n\nAlso, food at (5,1) and (6,2).\n\n(5,1) has value 1, life 10.\n\nNow, if I go to (2,1) first, I can then go to (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5) first, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut there is also food at (2,1), which is close.\n\nAnother option: go left to (1,3) on turn 1.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go U, D, L, but direction would be L if I moved left.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3), no food, so snake to [(1,3)].\n\nThen direction now L? Head at (1,3), came from left, so direction L? The head direction is based on the move.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3) from (2,3) left, so direction is L.\n\nThen turn 2: from (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,4).\n\nD to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle.\n\nL to (0,3), but x=0 is border wall.\n\nR to (2,3), but (2,3) is where I came from, and since direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed? Current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nLet's see: from (1,3), with direction L, I can move U, D, L, but not R.\n\nBut U to (1,4): obstacle\n\nD to (1,2): obstacle\n\nL to (0,3): wall\n\nAll invalid moves! So if I go to (1,3) on turn 1, on turn 2 I have no valid moves, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, moving L to (1,3) is very bad, should be avoided.\n\nSo for turn 1, L is not a good choice because it leads to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, only U or D are viable for turn 1.\n\nNow, between U and D.\n\nIf I go U to (2,4) on turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (2,5), eat food, snake to [(2,5),(2,4)]\n\nNow, from (2,5), as before, can move D or R.\n\nIf move D to (2,4), which is tail, so after move, head to (2,4), body to (2,5), snake [(2,4),(2,5)]\n\nThen from (2,4), direction D? Since moved down.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5) which is body, not tail? Positions: head at (2,4), body at (2,5), so (2,5) is body segment.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), which is occupied by body, and it's not the tail, because tail is at (2,5), but when I move, if I move to (2,5), it is the position of the body segment, which is not the tail? In this case, length 2, so body segment is also the tail.\n\nSnake positions: segment 0: head (2,4), segment 1: tail (2,5)\n\nIf I move head to (2,5), which is where segment 1 is.\n\nSince segment 1 is the tail, and head moves to that cell, it should be safe because the tail will move away.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,5), then the body segment (tail) moves to the old head position (2,4), so new snake: head at (2,5), body at (2,4). So it swapped positions.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIf it were a body segment not tail, it would collide.\n\nBut here it is tail, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3), or L to (1,4), or R to (3,4).\n\n(1,4) is obstacle, so L invalid.\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) should be free.\n\nR to (3,4): free.\n\nBack to after eating at (2,5): [(2,5),(2,4)]\n\nMove R to (3,5): head to (3,5), no food, so snake to [(3,5),(2,5)]\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, not border, obstacles: (2,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) not listed, so free? (3,6) x=3,y=6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), but not (3,6), so should be free.\n\nD to (3,4)\n\nL to (2,5) which is body, but tail? Positions: head (3,5), body at (2,5), so (2,5) is tail.\n\nMoving L to (2,5) should be safe.\n\nR to (4,5)\n\n Etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,1) which is below.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D on turn 1 to (2,2), then turn 2 to (2,1), eat, snake [(2,1),(2,2)]\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2) which is tail, safe; L to (1,1); R to (3,1)\n\nD to (2,0) wall, invalid.\n\n(1,1) should be free, as earlier.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\nFood at (5,1) is at (5,1), which is to the right and down.\n\nAlso, (6,2) at (6,2).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should plan to eat multiple food.\n\nBut there are obstacles, so I need to find a path.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,1) and (2,5) are symmetric, but let's see the surroundings.\n\nRow x=1 has many obstacles, so it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) or (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, but then from (1,1), I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle.\n\nD to (1,0) wall.\n\nL to (0,1) wall.\n\nR to (2,1) but that's where I came from, and direction: if I moved to (1,1) from (2,1) left, direction L, then moving R to (2,1) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I move L to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen at (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen moves: U to (1,2) obstacle, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) opposite, not allowed. So stuck, die.\n\nTherefore, from (2,1), moving L to (1,1) is bad.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (2,2) is safe but leads back.\n\nOr move R to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, for the upper part.\n\nSo to avoid dead ends, I should not go towards the left where x=1 is blocked.\n\nTherefore, for the first move, going U might be better than D, because if I go to (2,5), I can move right to (3,5) which is open area.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), I can move right to (3,1) to open area.\n\nBut at (2,1), if I go down, it's wall, so only up, left, or right, but left is dead end, up is back, so only right is good.\n\nSimilarly at (2,5), down or right.\n\nNow, food at (5,1) and (6,2) are both in the bottom-right area.\n\n(5,1) y=1, (6,2) y=2.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (4,1) and (4,2), so around (4,1) might be blocked.\n\n(4,1) is obstacle, (4,2) obstacle.\n\n(5,1) is food, so I can go there.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nSuppose on turn 1, I move U to (2,4).\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5), eat, snake [(2,5),(2,4)]\n\nNow, from here, I need to move. I can move R to (3,5) for safety, avoiding potential dead ends.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), no food, so snake head to (3,5), body to (2,5)? Before move: [(2,5),(2,4)], move head to (3,5), no food, so new positions: head (3,5), body at old head (2,5), so [(3,5),(2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) which is tail, safe, or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is free, as I thought.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nBut I want to eat more food, like (5,1) or (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is down and right.\n\nFrom (3,5), I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is further.\n\nFood at (2,1) is still there, but I'm at (3,5), far.\n\nLife span is high, so ok.\n\nBut let's see if I can go directly to (5,1).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) on turn 4.\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4), move D to (3,3), or other.\n\n(3,3) is where? Free, I think.\n\nThen down to (3,2), (3,1), but (3,1) is not food, food at (5,1).\n\nSo need to go right.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move R to (4,4) or something.\n\nBut there are obstacles at (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), etc.\n\n(4,1) and (4,2) are obstacles, so row x=4, y=1 and 2 are blocked.\n\nBut (5,1) is food at (5,1), which is next to (4,1) obstacle.\n\nSo to eat (5,1), I need to approach it from above or side, but not from left if x=4 is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) at (6,2).\n\nNow, let's consider the path to (5,1).\n\nFor example, from current, if I go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), then to (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, so cannot go right from (3,1) to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go R to (4,1) but obstacle, or U to (3,2), or D to (3,0) wall, or L to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is food, but if I go to (3,1), not food.\n\nAssume I go to (3,1) first.\n\nBut (3,1) is free.\n\nThen from (3,1), moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) obstacle. So only U or L.\n\nL to (2,1) which has food.\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), eat, then snake grows.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to the beginning, if I go U first to (2,5), I can then go right and down to approach (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go D first to (2,1), I can go right to (3,1), then up or something.\n\nBut at (2,1), if I eat, then snake at [(2,1),(2,2)], then move R to (3,1), for example.\n\n(3,1) has no food, so move to (3,1), head to (3,1), body to (2,1), so [(3,1),(2,1)]\n\nThen from (3,1), as above, can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1) which is body, tail? Positions: head (3,1), body at (2,1), so (2,1) is tail. Moving L to (2,1) safe, or U to (3,2).\n\nU to (3,2) free.\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to get to (5,1), I need to go right from (3,1), but (4,1) obstacle, so I have to go up first to y=2 or higher, then right.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) go U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., or to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, so cannot go directly right from (3,2) to (4,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) obstacle. So only U, D, L.\n\nR not possible.\n\nSo I can go U to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\nThen to (5,3), down to (5,2), but (5,2) not food, food at (5,1), so down to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at y=1, so from (5,2) to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,2) is free? No obstacles at (5,2), only (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) obstacle, but (5,2) free.\n\nSo path possible.\n\nSimilarly from the top.\n\nBut let's compare the two options for turn 1: U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), I eat food on turn 2, score +1.\n\nThen I can move to open area.\n\nIf I go D to (2,1), eat on turn 2, score +1, then move to open area.\n\nBut there is food at (2,1) and (2,5), both similar.\n\nHowever, there is also food at (5,1) which is closer to the bottom, so if I go to (2,1) first, I might reach (5,1) faster.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, I am at (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2), (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, so to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). That's more steps.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Similar number of steps.\n\nBut at (2,5), after eating, I can go directly down to (2,4), but that doesn't help much.\n\nAnother food at (6,2), which is at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) x=6,y=2.\n\nTo reach it, I need to go to x=6.\n\nWith obstacles, it might be tricky.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles at (4,1), (4,2), so around there.\n\nBut (6,2) is free.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to survive and eat as much as possible.\n\nBut with only 4 food, and high life span, I can eat all.\n\nBut I must avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, the area near x=1 is dangerous because of obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, near x=4 y=1-2.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 1.\n\nPerhaps I should go U to (2,4) on turn 1, then to (2,5) on turn 2, eat, then on turn 3 move R to (3,5) to get away from the left wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to approach (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go D first, to (2,1), then move R to (3,1) to avoid left.\n\nBut at (3,1), I am closer to y=1, so might be easier to reach (5,1).\n\nFor example, from (3,1), go U to (3,2), then since R to (4,2) blocked, go U to (3,3), then R to (4,3), then D to (4,2) but (4,2) obstacle, cannot, so to (5,3), then D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (5,1).\n\n(5,2) to (5,1) is down.\n\nSimilarly, from top, same.\n\nBut from (3,1), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut from (3,5), I go to (3,4), (3,3), same as above.\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut when I go to (2,1), I eat earlier? Turn 1 move to (2,2), no eat, turn 2 to (2,1) eat.\n\nSimilarly for up, turn 1 to (2,4), turn 2 to (2,5) eat.\n\nSame timing.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,1), on turn 2, I am at (2,1), then on turn 3 I can move R to (3,1), no eat, so positions [(3,1),(2,1)]\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), move U to (3,2), no eat, snake to [(3,2),(3,1)]\n\nThen turn 5: move U to (3,3), no eat, snake to [(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (4,3), no eat, snake to [(4,3),(3,3)]\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (5,3), no eat, snake to [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (5,2), no eat, snake to [(5,2),(5,3)]\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (5,1), eat food, score +1, snake grows to [(5,1),(5,2),(5,3)]\n\nThen I can go to (6,2) or other.\n\nSimilarly, if I went up first, I would be at (3,5) on turn 3, then down to (3,4) turn 4, (3,3) turn 5, (4,3) turn 6, (5,3) turn 7, (5,2) turn 8, (5,1) turn 9, same as above, but from (3,5) to (3,4) is down, so turn 3 at (3,5), turn 4 to (3,4), turn 5 to (3,3), turn 6 to (4,3), etc., same as above, reach (5,1) on turn 9.\n\nBut in the down-first scenario, I ate (2,1) on turn 2, then (5,1) on turn 9.\n\nIn up-first, I ate (2,5) on turn 2, then (5,1) on turn 9.\n\nThen I have food at (6,2) and (2,5) is eaten, but (2,5) was eaten, so only (6,2) left? Food positions: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1), (5,1). I ate one on turn 2, so three left.\n\n(6,2) is still there.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I can go to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,1), head at (5,1), snake [(5,1),(5,2),(5,3)]\n\nMove to (6,2)? (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, from (5,1), I can move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2), etc.\n\n(6,1) is x=6,y=1, not border? x=7 is border, so x=6 is not wall.\n\ny=1 not wall.\n\nBut (6,1) has no food, food at (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,1), moves: U to (5,2) which is body? Positions: head (5,1), body at (5,2), so (5,2) is not tail, tail is at (5,3).\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), it is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nBecause the body segment at (5,2) will not move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head moves.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment doesn't move until after the head moves, but the head is moving into it.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when moving to the tail cell.\n\nSo here, (5,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (5,2) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle.\n\nR to (6,1), which should be free.\n\nSo only R to (6,1) is possible from (5,1).\n\nMove to (6,1), no food, so head to (6,1), body segments move: first body to old head (5,1), tail to old first body (5,2)? Positions: before move, [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] head (5,1), body (5,2), tail (5,3).\n\nMove head to (6,1), no food, so new head (6,1), first body to old head position (5,1), second body to old first body position (5,2), tail disappears? No, the tail moves to the position of the previous tail-1, but since length 3, segments: after move, head at (6,1), body segment 1 at (5,1), body segment 2 (tail) at (5,2). So [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nThen from (6,1), I can move U to (6,2), which has food.\n\nSo on turn 10, move U to (6,2), eat, snake grows to [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)] head (6,2), then body (6,1), (5,1), tail (5,2).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut back to the choice.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat two food by turn 10 or so.\n\nBut if I go down first, I eat (2,1) early, then (5,1).\n\nIf up first, eat (2,5) early, then (5,1).\n\nBut there is also (6,2) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence above, I ate it.\n\nBut in the down-first case, after eating (5,1) on turn 9, I am at (5,1), then to (6,1) turn 10, to (6,2) turn 11.\n\nSimilarly in up-first.\n\nBut when I go to (2,5) first, I am at top, and (2,5) is eaten, so no issue.\n\nBut there is food at (2,1) which I didn't eat in the up-first scenario.\n\nIn up-first, I ate (2,5) on turn 2, then went to (5,1) on turn 9, then (6,2) on turn 11.\n\nBut (2,1) is still there, I can go back to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, in down-first, I ate (2,1) on turn 2, then (5,1) on turn 9, then (6,2) on turn 11, and (2,5) is still there.\n\nSo I can eat all four food.\n\nBut I need to see which is better for survival and path.\n\nNotice that in the left side, x=1 has obstacles, so going to (2,1) might be riskier because from (2,1), if I don't move right, I can get stuck, but I can move right.\n\nSimilarly for (2,5).\n\nBut at (2,5), there is obstacle above at (2,6), so I cannot go up, but I can go down or right.\n\nAt (2,1), I cannot go down, but can go up or right.\n\nAlso, the area around (4,1-2) has obstacles, so when going to (5,1), I need to approach from above, like (5,2).\n\nIn terms of the grid, the bottom row has fewer free cells because y=0 wall, and obstacles at (4,1), (1,2), etc., but (2,1) is food, so it's ok.\n\nBut let's consider the life span: all food has life span 9 or 10 at turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: food life span decreases each turn, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 1, life span decreases by 1 for each food.\n\nFood at turn 1:\n\n(6,2): life 9, after turn 1, life 8? Let's see.\n\nThe state is at turn 1, before action.\n\n\"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" given at turn 1.\n\nThen after each turn, life span decreases.\n\nSo at start of turn 1, food has given life span.\n\nAfter turn 1 action, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nFor example, (6,2) life 9 at turn 1 start.\n\nAfter turn 1, if not eaten, life 8.\n\nAfter turn 2, life 7, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life 9, (2,1) life 9, (5,1) life 10.\n\nSince all high, and I can eat within few turns, no immediate risk of disappearing.\n\nFor turn 1, I think either U or D is fine, but to avoid the left dead end, and since direction is L, moving U or D is better.\n\nPerhaps I should choose D to go to (2,1) because (5,1) is also at bottom, so shorter path to cluster.\n\nFrom (2,3), going D to (2,2), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nGoing U to (2,4), (2,5), then to (3,5), then down.\n\nThe vertical distance to (5,1) is larger from (2,5) than from (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,1) is delta x=3, delta y=4, so Manhattan distance 7.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (5,1) is delta x=3, delta y=0, distance 3.\n\nSo much closer.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,2) from (2,1) is delta x=4, delta y=1, distance 5, from (2,5) is delta x=4, delta y=3, distance 7.\n\nSo from bottom, it's closer to the other food.\n\nTherefore, going down first might be better to reach (5,1) and (6,2) faster.\n\nAlso, (2,1) is eaten early.\n\nThen (2,5) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nBut with obstacles, I need to see if I can go back.\n\nSince life span is 9, at turn 1, after 9 turns, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nTurn 1 start, life 9, after turn 1, life 8, ..., after turn 9, life 0, so disappears before turn 10? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, before action, life span is L, after action, if not eaten, life span decreases to L-1.\n\nWhen life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,5), life span 9 at turn 1 start.\n\nAfter turn 1: life 8\n\nAfter turn 2: life 7 (after eating, if eaten on turn 2, it's eaten)\n\nIf not eaten, after turn 9: life 0, so before turn 10, it disappears, so on turn 10 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn my earlier plan, if I go down first, I eat (2,1) on turn 2, (5,1) on turn 9, then (6,2) on turn 11.\n\n(2,5) life span: at turn 1, life 9, after turn 1, life 8; after turn 2, life 7; ... after turn 9, life 0, so it disappears before turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, before action, life span is 1? Let's index.\n\nTurn k: before action, food life span S_k.\n\nAfter action, if not eaten, S_{k+1} = S_k - 1.\n\nWhen S_k = 1, after turn, if not eaten, S=0, disappears.\n\nFor (2,5), S_1 =9\n\nS_2=8 (after turn 1)\n\n...\n\nS_10 = 9 - 9 =0 after turn 9, so on turn 10, it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, to eat (2,5), I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nIn down-first plan, on turn 9 I am at (5,1) eating, so on turn 10, I am at (5,1) or moving to (6,1), far from (2,5), and on turn 10 (2,5) is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nSimilarly, in up-first plan, I eat (2,5) on turn 2, so it's eaten.\n\nThen (2,1) might disappear if not eaten.\n\n(2,1) life 9 at turn 1, after turn 9, life 0, gone on turn 10.\n\nIn up-first plan, on turn 9 I am at (5,1) eating, far from (2,1), so cannot eat (2,1) by turn 9, so it disappears.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, I can only eat two food: the one I eat first and (5,1), and then (6,2), but (2,1) or (2,5) will disappear.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn down-first:\n\n- Turn 2: eat (2,1)\n\n- Turn 9: eat (5,1)\n\n- Turn 11: eat (6,2) approximately\n\n(2,5) disappears before turn 10, so not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, in up-first:\n\n- Turn 2: eat (2,5)\n\n- Turn 9: eat (5,1)\n\n- Turn 11: eat (6,2)\n\n(2,1) disappears.\n\nNow, (6,2) life span 9 at turn 1, after turn 9, life 0, gone on turn 10.\n\nBut I eat it on turn 11, which is after turn 10, so it might be gone.\n\n(6,2) S_1=9\n\nAfter turn 1: S=8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9: S=0, so before turn 10, it disappears. On turn 10, it is not there.\n\nI plan to eat on turn 11, which is too late.\n\nSimilarly for (5,1), life 10 at turn 1.\n\nS_1=10\n\nAfter turn 1:9\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 10:0, gone on turn 11.\n\nI eat (5,1) on turn 9: on turn 9 before action, S= ? S_1=10, after turn 1:9, after turn 2:8, ..., after turn 8:2, before turn 9: S_9=2? Let's define.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has life span L_t.\n\nAfter the action:\n\n- If eaten, removed.\n\n- If not eaten, L_{t+1} = L_t - 1\n\nIf L_{t+1} = 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (5,1), L_1=10\n\nAt turn 1 start, L=10\n\nAfter turn 1 action, if not eaten, L=9 for turn 2.\n\nAt turn 2 start, L=9 if not eaten.\n\n...\n\nAt turn 9 start, L=10 - 8 =2? From turn 1 to turn 9, 8 turns passed? Turns: after turn 1, L=9; after turn 2, L=8; ... after turn k, L = initial - k.\n\nAt turn t start, L_t = initial - (t-1)\n\nBecause at turn 1 start, L_1 = initial.\n\nAfter turn 1, L decreases to initial -1 for turn 2 start.\n\nSo at turn t start, L_t = initial - (t-1)\n\nFor (5,1), initial life 10, so at turn t, L_t = 10 - (t-1)\n\nIt can be eaten on turn t if L_t >0.\n\nAfter eating, it's gone.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn t, L decreases.\n\nIt disappears when L_t =1 and not eaten, then after turn, L=0, gone.\n\nSpecifically, if on turn t, L_t =1, and not eaten, then after turn, it disappears.\n\nIf L_t >1, it stays for next turn.\n\nFor (5,1), L_t = 10 - (t-1) = 11 - t\n\nAt turn t, if 11-t >0, can be eaten.\n\nFor example, at t=1, L=10\n\nt=2, L=9\n\n...\n\nt=10, L=10-9=1\n\nt=11, L=10-10=0, but at t=11 start, L=0, so not present.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) initial life 9, L_t = 9 - (t-1) =10-t\n\nAt t=1, L=9\n\nt=2, L=8\n\n...\n\nt=9, L=10-9=1\n\nt=10, L=0, not present.\n\n(2,1) same as (2,5).\n\n(6,2) initial life 9, same as above.\n\nNow, in down-first plan:\n\n- Turn 1: move to (2,2), no eat\n\n- Turn 2: move to (2,1), eat (2,1), score +1\n\nThen at turn 3: move to (3,1), no eat\n\nTurn 4: move to (3,2), no eat (assuming U from (3,1))\n\nTurn 5: move to (3,3), no eat\n\nTurn 6: move to (4,3), no eat\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,3), no eat\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,2), no eat\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,1), eat (5,1), score +1\n\nAt turn 9, (5,1) L_t = 11-9 =2, so can be eaten.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,1), move to (6,1), no eat\n\n(6,2) at turn 10: L_t = 9 - (10-1) =9-9=0, so not present, gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) gone on turn 10.\n\nSo I only eat two food.\n\nIn up-first plan:\n\nTurn 1: move to (2,4), no eat\n\nTurn 2: move to (2,5), eat (2,5), score +1\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,5), no eat\n\nTurn 4: move to (3,4), no eat\n\nTurn 5: move to (3,3), no eat\n\nTurn 6: move to (4,3), no eat\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,3), no eat\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,2), no eat\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,1), eat (5,1), score +1\n\nThen (2,1) gone on turn 10, (6,2) gone on turn 10.\n\nSame, only two food eaten.\n\nBut I can eat (6,2) if I go directly, but it has less life.\n\n(6,2) life 9, disappears on turn 10.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be there before turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 9 I am at (5,1), so on turn 10 I can move, but (6,2) is gone.\n\nIf I go to (6,2) earlier.\n\nFor example, after eating the first food, go directly to (6,2) instead of (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) has longer life, so I can eat (6,2) first if possible.\n\n(6,2) life shorter.\n\nIn down-first: after eating (2,1) on turn 2, at (2,1), I can instead go to (3,1), then to (4,1) but (4,1) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nGo to (3,1), then to (3,2), then to (4,2) obstacle, no, so must go up to (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, on turn 3 move R to (3,1), then on turn 4 move U to (3,2), then on turn 5 move U to (3,3), then on turn 6 move R to (4,3), then on turn 7 move R to (5,3), then on turn 8 move D to (5,2), then on turn 9 move D to (5,1) for (5,1), or on turn 8 from (5,3) move R to (6,3), then D to (6,2) for (6,2).\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 7 (in down-first), positions [(5,3),(4,3)] or something.\n\nDown-first:\n\nTurn 2: at (2,1) after eat\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1), snake [(3,1),(2,1)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2), snake [(3,2),(3,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3), snake [(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,3), snake [(4,3),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3), snake [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nNow, from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2) on turn 8, snake to [(5,2),(5,3)]\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move D to (5,1) on turn 9 to eat (5,1), or move R to (6,3) on turn 8, but from (5,3), move R to (6,3) on turn 8.\n\n(6,3) should be free.\n\nThen snake to [(6,3),(5,3)]\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,3), move D to (6,2), eat (6,2), since (6,2) food.\n\nAt turn 9, (6,2) L_t = 9 - (9-1) =9-8=1, so can be eaten.\n\nThen score +1 for (6,2).\n\nBut I missed (5,1), which has life until turn 10.\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (6,2) after eating, snake [(6,2),(6,3),(5,3)] or something.\n\nThen I can go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,2), move D to (6,1), or L to (5,2), etc.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so from (6,2), move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,2) is free.\n\nOn turn 10: from (6,2), move to (5,2)? But (5,2) is not food.\n\nHead at (6,2), after eating, positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (5,3)? Before move to (6,2): at turn 9 start, head at (6,3)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 8: after move to (6,3), snake [(6,3),(5,3)]\n\nTurn 9: move to (6,2), eat, so head to (6,2), body added at (6,3), so snake [(6,2),(6,3),(5,3)]\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,2), move to (5,2), for example.\n\n(5,2) free, no food, so move to (5,2), head to (5,2), body to (6,2), tail to (6,3)? Positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nMove head to (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), first body to old head (6,2), second body to old first body (6,3), tail gone? Length 3, segments 0,1,2.\n\nAfter move: head (5,2), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3) tail.\n\nSnake [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,2), move D to (5,1), eat (5,1), since L_t at turn 11: for (5,1), initial 10, L_t=10-(11-1)=10-10=0, so not present! Gone.\n\nL_t at turn 11: 10 - (11-1) =10-10=0, so not there.\n\nAt turn 10, L_t=10-(10-1)=10-9=1, so on turn 10, (5,1) can be eaten.\n\nBut on turn 10, I am at (6,2), moving to (5,2), not to (5,1).\n\nSo I miss it.\n\nFrom (6,2) on turn 10, I can move directly to (5,1)? From (6,2) to (5,1) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not possible. Moves are only U,D,L,R.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1) or U to (6,3) which is body, or R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nL to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nNeither is (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,2) on turn 11, I can move D to (5,1), but (5,1) gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,2) first, I eat it on turn 9, but miss (5,1) if not careful.\n\nTo eat both, I need to eat (5,1) before turn 11 and (6,2) before turn 10.\n\n(6,2) must be eaten by turn 9, since at turn 10 it is gone.\n\n(5,1) by turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, after eating first food, I can go to (6,2) first.\n\nFor example, in down-first: after eating (2,1) on turn 2, at (2,1), then:\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,2), eat (6,2)\n\nThen on turn 10, from (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), but (5,1) is at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move D to (6,1), then L to (5,1) on turn 11, but (5,1) gone on turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, from (6,2), move to (6,1), no eat, snake to [(6,1),(6,2),(6,3)] or something.\n\nThen turn 11: move L to (5,1), but (5,1) not there.\n\nSo cannot eat (5,1).\n\nIf from (5,3) on turn 7, I move D to (5,2) on turn 8, then to (5,1) on turn 9, eat (5,1), then to (6,2) on turn 10 or 11, but (6,2) gone on turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, after eating (5,1), on turn 10 move to (6,1), then to (6,2) on turn 11, gone.\n\nSo I can only eat two food: the first one and either (5,1) or (6,2), but not both, because of the path and life span.\n\nUnless I eat the first one faster or choose a different first move.\n\nBut the first food is eaten on turn 2 in both cases.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,1) first directly, but it's far.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (5,1), minimum distance 3+2=5 moves, so eat on turn 6 or later.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move R, but not allowed, direction L, cannot move R.\n\nTurn 1 move U or D or L, but L bad.\n\nSay move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2 move D to (2,1) eat, but that's (2,1), not (5,1).\n\nTo go to (5,1), from (2,3) move D to (2,2), then D to (2,1), but (2,1) food, so if I go there, I eat it.\n\nI cannot avoid eating (2,1) if I go down.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up, I eat (2,5).\n\nSo I have to eat one of the close food first.\n\nThen the other close food will disappear.\n\nSo the maximum I can eat is two food: the close one and (5,1) or (6,2), but not all.\n\n(5,1) has life 10, so can be eaten later.\n\nIn down-first: eat (2,1) on turn 2, then go to (5,1) on turn 9, eat, then (6,2) is gone.\n\nOr eat (2,1) on turn 2, then go to (6,2) on turn 9, eat, then (5,1) on turn 10 if possible, but from (6,2) to (5,1) not direct.\n\nSo better to eat (5,1) since it has longer life.\n\nSimilarly in up-first.\n\nBut let's confirm with numbers.\n\nFor (6,2): must be eaten by turn 9, because at turn 10 it is gone.\n\nL_t at turn 9: 9 - (9-1) =1, so can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nAt turn 10, not present.\n\nFor (5,1): can be eaten on turn 10, L_t=10-(10-1)=1.\n\nAt turn 11, gone.\n\nSo I can eat (5,1) on turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, for example, down-first:\n\nTurn 2: eat (2,1) at (2,1)\n\nThen go to (5,1) via (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n\nTurn 3: to (3,1)\n\nTurn 4: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: to (5,1) eat (5,1)\n\nOn turn 9, eat (5,1), L_t=10-(9-1)=10-8=2, yes.\n\nThen on turn 10, I can go to (6,2)? From (5,1), move to (6,1) or something, but (6,2) is at (6,2), not adjacent to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), move R to (6,1), then on turn 11 to (6,2), but (6,2) gone on turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, from (5,1), move U to (5,2), but (5,2) may not be food, and I might collide or something.\n\nPositions after eating (5,1): on turn 9, after move to (5,1), eat, snake grows to [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]? Before move: at turn 9 start, head at (5,2) or where?\n\nTurn 8: at (5,2) after move from (5,3)? Let's:\n\nTurn 7: at (5,3), snake [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,2), no eat, so head to (5,2), body to (5,3), tail to (4,3)? Snake to [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] length 3.\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,1), eat (5,1), so head to (5,1), body added at (5,2), so snake [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,1), move to (6,1) or U to (5,2) but (5,2) body, collision, or D invalid, L to (4,1) obstacle, so only R to (6,1)\n\nMove to (6,1), no eat, snake moves: head to (6,1), body1 to (5,1), body2 to (5,2), tail to (5,3) or something. Positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nMove head to (6,1), no food, so new head (6,1), body1 to old head (5,1), body2 to old body1 (5,2), body3 to old body2 (5,3), tail gone? Length 4, segments 0,1,2,3.\n\nAfter move: head (6,1), body1 (5,1), body2 (5,2), body3 (5,3) tail.\n\nSo [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 11: from (6,1), move U to (6,2), but (6,2) gone, not there.\n\nSo no eat.\n\nThus, I can only eat two food.\n\nSimilarly for other choices.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5) which I can eat if I go up first, but then (2,1) disappears.\n\nSame thing.\n\nSo maximum two food eaten.\n\nNow, to choose which one, since (5,1) has life 10, it can be eaten later, so I should eat the one with shorter life first, but all except (5,1) have life 9, (5,1) life 10.\n\n(2,1), (2,5), (6,2) life 9, (5,1) life 10.\n\nSo I should eat one of the life 9 food first, then (5,1).\n\nFor example, eat (2,1) or (2,5) on turn 2, then eat (5,1) on turn 9.\n\n(6,2) will disappear, but I can't eat it anyway.\n\nSo for turn 1, I can choose either U or D.\n\nBut to make a choice, let's go D to (2,2) on turn 1, then to (2,1) on turn 2.\n\nOr U to (2,4) then to (2,5).\n\nSince the grid might have asymmetry, but in this case, similar.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (1,4) and (1,5), but for (2,5), it's ok.\n\nAt (2,1), there is obstacle at (1,2), but not affecting directly.\n\nSo I think both are fine.\n\nPerhaps go D to be closer to (5,1).\n\nSo for turn 1, move D.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current turn and future turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut how many turns to output? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, perhaps output a sequence.\n\nBut for the response, I should provide the action for turn 1, and perhaps for a few turns, but it says \"maximize score\" and \"prioritize long-term\", so maybe output a plan for several turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output for turn 1 only, but the format shows multiple.\n\nPerhaps output the action for the current turn and the next few.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll provide for turn 1 and turn 2.\n\nOr for 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, for turn 1, I decide to move D to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 2 move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 3 move R to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can start with that.\n\nSince the snake is short, and to avoid risk, move D.\n\nSo action for turn 1: D (down)\n\nThen for turn 2: D to (2,1)\n\nBut in the box, I need to write the sequence.\n\nPerhaps: Turn 1: D, Turn 2: D, etc.\n\nBut let's formalize.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 1):**\n- Snake position: Head at (2,3), length 1 (no body segments).\n- Head direction: Left (L).\n- Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n- Food:\n  - (6,2): value +1, life span 9\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 9\n  - (2,1): value +1, life span 9\n  - (5,1): value +1, life span 10\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:**\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 1):** Current head direction is L, so reverse move (R) is not allowed. Possible moves: U (to (2,4)), D (to (2,2)), or L (to (1,3)). \n  - L to (1,3) leads to a dead end: From (1,3), all moves (U, D, L, R) are invalid due to obstacles or walls, risking death on turn 2. Thus, L must be avoided.\n  - U to (2,4) or D to (2,2) are viable. Both allow reaching nearby food on turn 2: (2,5) for U or (2,1) for D.\n- **Food Lifespans:** All food has high initial life span, but decreases each turn. Critical deadlines:\n  - (2,1) and (2,5) must be eaten by turn 9 (disappear before turn 10).\n  - (6,2) must be eaten by turn 9 (disappear before turn 10).\n  - (5,1) must be eaten by turn 10 (disappear before turn 11).\n- **Path Efficiency and Survival:**\n  - Eating (2,1) or (2,5) on turn 2 is optimal for early score and growth.\n  - (5,1) has longer life (10) and is farther; it should be targeted after the first food.\n  - (6,2) has shorter life and is difficult to reach without sacrificing (5,1) due to path constraints and obstacles.\n  - Moving to (2,1) first (via D) positions the snake closer to (5,1), reducing Manhattan distance (from (2,1) to (5,1) is 3 moves vs. from (2,5) it is 7). This allows eating (5,1) by turn 9 with a safe path.\n  - Moving U to (2,5) first also works but leaves (2,1) uneaten and wasted, with similar outcomes for (5,1). However, D is preferred for proximity to (5,1) and to avoid the congested left-top area.\n  - After eating the first food, the snake must navigate obstacles (e.g., avoid x=1 row and move right to open areas). Tail collision is avoidable since the snake is short initially.\n- **Risk Avoidance:** Prioritize moves that avoid obstacles and dead ends. The left side (x=1) is high-risk due to multiple obstacles, so moving right early is safer. After eating, immediately head toward (5,1) via (3,1), (3,2), etc., to stay clear of walls.\n- **Score Maximization:** Aim to eat two food: (2,1) on turn 2 and (5,1) on turn 9. (6,2) and the other close food ((2,5) if D is chosen) cannot be eaten without missing (5,1) due to life span and path constraints. Maximum score is 2 with this plan.\n\n**Chosen Plan for Turns 1-5 (Extendable):**\n- **Turn 1:** Move D to (2,2) – Avoids dead end, positions for (2,1), and direction changes to D.\n- **Turn 2:** Move D to (2,1) – Eat (2,1), score +1, snake grows to length 2: head (2,1), tail (2,2).\n- **Turn 3:** Move R to (3,1) – Escape left-side risks; direction now R. No food, snake moves: head (3,1), tail (2,1).\n- **Turn 4:** Move U to (3,2) – Navigate toward open area; avoid moving left/down into traps. No food, snake: head (3,2), tail (3,1).\n- **Turn 5:** Move U to (3,3) – Continue to open space; prepare for rightward move to (5,1). No food, snake: head (3,3), tail (3,2).\n\n**Long-Term Extension (Turns 6-10):**\n- Turn 6: Move R to (4,3)\n- Turn 7: Move R to (5,3)\n- Turn 8: Move D to (5,2)\n- Turn 9: Move D to (5,1) – Eat (5,1), score +1 (total score 2).\n- (6,2) disappears by turn 10 and cannot be eaten safely.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Survival Focused:** Avoids all walls/obstacles and dead ends (e.g., no left moves after turn 1).\n- **Efficient Scoring:** Eats (2,1) immediately and (5,1) by deadline; misses (2,5) and (6,2) but they are unattainable with the 2-food maximum.\n- **Direction Handling:** After turn 1, direction updates based on move (e.g., turn 1 D sets direction D, enabling U/R on turn 2).\n- **5+ Turn Viability:** Path to (5,1) is clear and safe, with no collision risks due to short length.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 2: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up) \\\\\n}",
