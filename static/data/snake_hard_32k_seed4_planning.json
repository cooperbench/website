        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls are at the borders and internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is just the head, no body yet. So length is 1.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So currently moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,4) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food has value +1, so no negative food here. And life span 10 means they'll disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so I have 9 more turns to eat them? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 10 at turn t, it will disappear after turn t+9? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life span is N, then at turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it exists for N turns from now. For example, life span 10 at turn 0 means it will be there from turn 0 to turn 9, and disappear at turn 10? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it will be gone. But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" suggests that at turn t, with life span L, at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and when L=0, it disappears. So for life span 10 at turn 0, it will be present at turn 0 with life span 10, turn 1 with life span 9, ..., up to turn 9 with life span 1, and then disappear at turn 10. So I can eat it up to and including turn 9.\n\nBut in terms of availability, from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive, I can eat it.\n\nNow, since the snake has only one segment, the head, at (3,3), and direction left.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I have to consider no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from left, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles: I need to list all wall cells to avoid moving into.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. But since it's grid from 0 to 7, inclusive, (0,y) and (7,y) are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7).\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo all wall cells:\n\n- All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (x,0) for x=0 to 7? No, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, but (x,0) is y=0, which is border.\n\nSimilarly, (x,7) for x=0 to 7.\n\nPlus internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nNow, snake is at (3,3), so adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,4)  y+1 is up? In coordinates, usually y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is up, lower y is down. So (x,y), U to (x,y+1), D to (x,y-1), L to (x-1,y), R to (x+1,y).\n\nSo from (3,3):\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2)\n\n- L: (2,3)\n\n- R: (4,3)\n\nNow, check if these are valid moves, no walls or collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: (3,4) is not in wall list. Wall cells: (3,6) is wall, but (3,4) is not listed. Similarly, (3,2): y=2, not border, not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc. (3,2) not there.\n\n(2,3): is in internal obstacles? (2,3) is listed: (2,3) is an internal obstacle, so wall.\n\n(4,3): not in walls.\n\nAlso, since snake has only head, no body, so no collision with body possible.\n\nNow, food: food at (6,4), (4,5), (6,6). None adjacent to (3,3), so no immediate food to eat.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating any positive food will increase length to 2.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,3) with direction L:\n\nCan move U, D, or L (since not R, opposite).\n\nMove L to (2,3): but (2,3) is wall, as per internal obstacles. So cannot move left, because (2,3) is blocked.\n\nSo invalid move.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are U to (3,4) or D to (3,2).\n\nCannot move R because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction L, so moving R would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, U to (3,4) or D to (3,2).\n\nI need to evaluate which is better.\n\nThink ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\nInternal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- (0,0) to (0,7)\n\n- (7,0) to (7,7)\n\n- (0,0) to (7,0) — (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n\n- (0,7) to (7,7) — (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n\nPlus: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nNow, (1,3) and (2,3) are walls, (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) walls, etc.\n\nFood: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6)\n\nSnake: (3,3)\n\nNow, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) or D to (3,2)\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then position is (3,4), and since I moved up, new direction is U.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), new direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can plan further.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to food or safe areas.\n\nFirst, let's see where the food is relative to current position.\n\n(4,5) is at x=4,y=5, which is up and right from (3,3). (3,3) to (4,5) is Δx=1, Δy=2, so not adjacent.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, Δx=3, Δy=1\n\n(6,6) at x=6,y=6, Δx=3, Δy=3\n\nAll are to the right and up, but I have obstacles.\n\nAlso, there are walls around, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nNow, since the snake is short, I can go for food, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nMoreover, the tail reward danger: but currently no tail, so not an issue yet.\n\nLet's consider moving up to (3,4).\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), new head position (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: since direction U, I can move U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nFrom (3,4):\n\n- U: (3,5)\n\n- D: (3,3) — but (3,3) was previous position, but now since snake was only head, after moving to (3,4), the body is... snake positions: initially [(3,3)], after moving to (3,4), the snake will be [(3,4), (3,3)]? No.\n\nSnake positions: head first. When I move, the head moves to new position, and the body follows, but since only one segment, after eating food, length increases.\n\nCurrently, no food eaten, so moving to a new cell without food, snake remains length 1, so after moving to (3,4), positions: [(3,4)], since no body, tail is gone? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves to an empty cell, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward, but since only head, moving to new cell, the old position is vacated, so snake is now at new position only.\n\nFor example, start: head at (3,3), length 1.\n\nMove to (3,4): now head at (3,4), and since no body, the snake is just [(3,4)], effectively the tail was there but since no length, it disappears. So positions become [(3,4)].\n\nSimilarly, if I eat food, then when I move to food, head moves to food cell, and since I eat, length increases, so the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at food, and previous position becomes body.\n\nBut here, no food at (3,4) or (3,2), so moving to either, snake will still be length 1 at new position.\n\nSo after move to (3,4), snake at [(3,4)], direction U.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2).\n\nNow back to possible moves from (3,4) with direction U.\n\nCan move U, L, R, not D.\n\nCells:\n\n- U: (3,5)\n\n- L: (2,4)\n\n- R: (4,4)\n\nNow, check walls: (3,5) not wall, (2,4) not wall? Walls: internal (1,3), (2,3), etc. (2,4) not listed, should be free. Similarly (4,4) not wall.\n\n(4,4) is not in obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (5,3), (5,4), etc., but (4,4) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2) if I go down.\n\nFirst, let's consider both options.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1: position (3,4), dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nAll seem free.\n\nNow, food: (4,5) is at (4,5), which is adjacent to (4,4)? From (4,4) to (4,5) is U, but (4,4) is not current.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (4,4) by moving R, then from there to (4,5) by U.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), which is to the right.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, (5,3) and (5,4) are walls, so I cannot go to x=5 at y=3 or y=4.\n\n(5,3) and (5,4) are walls, so cells (5,3) and (5,4) are blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) wall, but not relevant yet.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,4), then say I move R to (4,4).\n\nThen at (4,4), dir R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (4,4), can move U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nU to (4,5), which has food! (4,5) has positive food.\n\nSo if I go to (4,5), I eat it, snake grows to length 2.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4), I could go other ways.\n\nBut let's think the path.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4) dir U, move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,4) dir R, move U to (4,5) — eat food, snake now head at (4,5), body at (4,4), length 2.\n\nDirection now U.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5) dir U: U, L, R, not D.\n\nU: (4,6)\n\nL: (3,5)\n\nR: (5,5)\n\nNow, walls: (5,5) not wall? (5,3) and (5,4) walls, but (5,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), so (5,5) is not wall, free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) not wall, (3,5) not wall.\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, but (3,5) is fine.\n\nNow, if I go to (4,6), or etc.\n\nBut this is one path to get food quickly.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (6,4) and (6,6), but (6,4) is at (6,4), which is far.\n\n(6,6) also.\n\nBut life span 10, so I have time.\n\nNow, back to turn 0, I could move D to (3,2).\n\nIf move D to (3,2), then snake at (3,2), dir D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (3,2) dir D, can move D, L, R, not U (opposite).\n\nD: (3,1)\n\nL: (2,2)\n\nR: (4,2)\n\nNow, walls: (3,1) not wall, but y=1, not border. Internal walls: (2,1) is wall, but (2,2) not, (3,1) not, (4,2) not.\n\n(2,1) is wall, so (2,2) is adjacent but not wall.\n\nNow, from here, food is at (4,5), etc., which is up, so I have to go up eventually, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), if I go R to (4,2), then to (4,3), but (4,3) is not wall? (5,3) is wall, but (4,3) is free? Walls: internal (5,3), so (4,3) should be free.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,3) U, then to (4,4), etc., but I can go to (4,5) from (4,4) as before.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could go up from (3,2) but cannot directly, since dir D, can only move D, L, R, not U immediately.\n\nFrom (3,2) dir D, I can move to (4,2) R, then from (4,2) dir R, then I can move U to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut compared to moving up first, it might be slower to get to food.\n\nNow, also, there is a wall at (2,1) and (2,3), so the left side might be dangerous.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (3,2), and then left to (2,2), but (2,2) is free, but (2,1) is wall below, (2,3) wall above, so (2,2) is a bit trapped, but I can move R or D from there.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I go, say, to (2,2) from (3,2) by L, then at (2,2) dir L, then can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU: (2,3) but (2,3) is wall! Cannot.\n\nD: (2,1) but (2,1) is wall! Cannot.\n\nL: (1,2) — but (1,2) not wall? Borders: x=0 is wall, but (1,2) x=1 not 0, so should be free, unless internal wall. Internal walls: (1,3) and (1,6), so (1,2) not wall, free.\n\nSo from (2,2) dir L, I can only move L to (1,2), since U and D blocked by walls.\n\nThen at (1,2), I can move, etc., but this seems to go left, away from food, and might be risky if I get stuck.\n\nWhereas food is on the right.\n\nSo probably moving down is less desirable because it might lead to dead ends or take longer to reach food.\n\nMoreover, with life span 10, I have time, but since all food is +1, I should aim to eat as many as possible, but need to survive.\n\nNow, back to moving up.\n\nFrom (3,4), I have options.\n\nEarlier I thought of going to (4,4) then (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 2, I eat at (4,5).\n\nNow, after that, snake is at (4,5) head, (4,4) body, dir U.\n\nThen I need to move.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6) is free? Walls: (3,6) is wall, but (4,6) not listed, should be free. Internal walls: (3,6), (5,6), but not (4,6), so (4,6) free.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\n(5,5) free, as (5,5) not wall.\n\nNow, if I go to (4,6), then I can go further, but (4,6) is y=6, close to top wall y=7.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (4,6) to U (4,7) is wall, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, other directions.\n\nBut I have food at (6,6) and (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at top-right.\n\nFrom (4,6), I could go R to (5,6), but (5,6) is wall! Internal obstacle (5,6), so cannot.\n\n(5,6) wall, so from (4,6), I cannot go R to (5,6).\n\nCan go L to (3,6), but (3,6) wall, cannot.\n\nCan go D to (4,5), but (4,5) is body now? Snake positions: head at (4,5), body at (4,4), so (4,5) is head, moving from there.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is the body segment, so I would collide with my own body.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment.\n\nSo if I move to (4,4), which is occupied by body, I die.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any cell with body is deadly.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,6): free, not body\n\n- L to (3,5): free, not body\n\n- R to (5,5): free, not body\n\n- D to (4,4): but (4,4) is body, so collision, invalid.\n\nSo cannot move down.\n\nNow, U to (4,6): as above, then from (4,6), I can only move U, but (4,7) is wall (y=7), or D to (4,5) which is now body? After moving to (4,6), head at (4,6), body at (4,5) and (4,4).\n\nAt (4,6), dir U (since moved up).\n\nThen moves: U to (4,7) — wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5) — body, collision.\n\nL to (3,6) — wall, invalid.\n\nR to (5,6) — wall, invalid.\n\nAll moves invalid? That means from (4,6), I have no safe move, I die next turn.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nIf I go to (4,6) after eating at (4,5), I get stuck and die.\n\nBecause from (4,6), surrounded by walls or body.\n\n(4,6) has:\n\n- U: (4,7) wall\n\n- D: (4,5) body\n\n- L: (3,6) wall\n\n- R: (5,6) wall\n\nAll blocked, so if I move there, I die immediately when I try to move from there.\n\nSo that's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, from (4,5), I should not move up to (4,6).\n\nInstead, move left to (3,5) or right to (5,5).\n\nNow, (3,5): free, not body.\n\n(5,5): free.\n\nNow, if I move to (3,5) from (4,5), by moving L.\n\nThen at (3,5), dir L (since moved left).\n\nThen snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4)\n\nPositions: after moving to (3,5), head at (3,5), previous head (4,5) becomes body, and body (4,4) is still there, so [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]? No.\n\nSequence: before move, snake at [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nMove head to (3,5), so new head (3,5), and tail moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the tail at (4,4) moves to where the body was, but since only two segments, when head moves to new cell, the body segment becomes the tail, and since no growth, the tail position is vacated.\n\nStandard snake: when moving to empty cell, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away.\n\nHere, from positions: head at A, body at B.\n\nMove head to C (empty), then new head at C, and body moves to where head was, so now snake at [C, A], and B is empty.\n\nIn this case: at (4,5) head, (4,4) body.\n\nMove head to (3,5), which is empty, no food, so after move, head at (3,5), body at (4,5), and (4,4) is vacated.\n\nSo positions: [(3,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (5,5), same thing.\n\nNow back to (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), dir L.\n\nThen at (3,5), I can move U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nU: (3,6) — but (3,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,4)\n\nL: (2,5)\n\nR: not possible.\n\n(3,4) is free? But is it body? Currently, body is at (4,5), so (3,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) free.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free now.\n\nAt (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): wall, invalid\n\n- D to (3,4): free, not body\n\n- L to (2,5): free, not body\n\n- R to (4,5): but (4,5) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nIf move D to (3,4), then head to (3,4), body at (3,5), (4,5)? Move to (3,4), new head (3,4), body moves to (3,5), and (4,5) vacated? Positions: before move, head (3,5), body (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), new head (3,4), body moves to previous head position (3,5), so snake at [(3,4), (3,5)], and (4,5) empty.\n\nThen direction D (since moved down).\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 0 decision.\n\nI was considering moving up to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4) dir U, I can go to (4,4) by R, then turn 2 to (4,5) by U to eat.\n\nBut after eating at (4,5), I need to avoid (4,6) as it's a dead end.\n\nSo from (4,5), I should go to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\n(5,5) might be better to reach other food.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), and (5,3) and (5,4) are walls, so (5,5) is ok.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (5,6)? (5,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nU: (5,6) wall\n\nD: (5,4) wall\n\nL: (4,5) body? After moving to (5,5), let's see.\n\nIf at turn 2 I eat at (4,5), head at (4,5), body at (4,4)\n\nThen move R to (5,5), new head (5,5), body at (4,5), and (4,4) vacated.\n\nDir R.\n\nThen at (5,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,6): wall, invalid\n\nD to (5,4): wall, invalid\n\nL to (4,5): body, collision\n\nR to (6,5): not wall, should be free.\n\n(6,5) is not border or internal wall, so free.\n\nAnd not body.\n\nSo can move R to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), etc.\n\nNow, food at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is down from (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) up.\n\nBut (6,6) has food.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) to eat, or U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut need to be careful with tail.\n\nFirst, let's outline the sequence from turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) — snake at (3,4), dir U\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4) — snake at (4,4), dir R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) — eat food, snake grows to length 2, head at (4,5), body at (4,4), dir U\n\nNow, from here, instead of U to (4,6), move R to (5,5) — as above, possible.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5) — now head at (5,5), body at (4,5), dir R\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (6,5) — head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (4,5)? Positions: after move to (5,5), snake [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nMove to (6,5), new head (6,5), body moves to (5,5), so snake [(6,5), (5,5)], and (4,5) empty. Length 2.\n\nDir R.\n\nNow, at (6,5), food at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is down, (6,6) up.\n\nI can move to either.\n\nBut need to avoid tail collision when eating.\n\nFirst, move D to (6,4): (6,4) has food, so I eat it, head moves to (6,4), and since eat, length increases, so tail doesn't move, so body: new head (6,4), body at (6,5), and previous body (5,5) becomes part, so snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: head (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nMove to (6,4): which has food, so head moves to (6,4), eat food, length increases by 1, so tail stays, so the body remains, and new head added, so positions: [ (6,4) head, (6,5) body, (5,5) tail ]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection D (since moved down).\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (6,6), eat food there.\n\nBut (6,6) also has food.\n\nNow, from (6,5), if I move D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen head at (6,4), body at (6,5) and (5,5).\n\nDir D.\n\nNow, possible moves: since dir D, can move D, L, R, not U.\n\nD: (6,3) — not wall? Borders: y=0, but (6,3) y=3, not border. Internal walls? None at (6,3), so free.\n\nL: (5,4) — but (5,4) is wall! Invalid.\n\nR: (7,4) — x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nU: not possible, opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,3).\n\nThen move to (6,3), new head (6,3), body moves to (6,4), (6,5), so tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5)? Positions: before move, head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (6,3), empty cell, no food, so head to (6,3), body moves: (6,5) to (6,4)? The segment that was at (6,5) moves to where head was (6,4), and (5,5) moves to where (6,5) was.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,3), body at (6,4), and (6,5). Tail at (6,5).\n\nDir D.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2), etc., but I'm at bottom, with walls.\n\ny=0 at bottom, so (6,2) to D (6,1), then (6,0) wall.\n\nAlso left, (5,3) wall, but (5,3) is wall, so from (6,3), L to (5,3) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,3) wall.\n\nSo only D or U, but U to (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (6,3), only D to (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) wall, dead.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf from (6,5) I move U to (6,6) instead.\n\n(6,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nTurn 4: at (6,5), move U to (6,6) — eat, head at (6,6), body at (6,5), and (5,5), length 3.\n\nDir U.\n\nNow, from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5) — body, collision.\n\nL to (5,6) — wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,6) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nAll invalid! Dead immediately.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo from (6,5), I cannot eat either food directly because it leads to death.\n\nBecause after eating, I'm stuck.\n\nFor (6,4): if I eat, I have to go down to (6,3), then stuck.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nBut I don't have to eat immediately.\n\nFrom (6,5), I could move to another cell first.\n\nAt (6,5), dir R, possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) invalid.\n\n(7,5) wall.\n\nL to (5,5): but (5,5) is the body segment! Currently body at (5,5), so moving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nSo cannot move left.\n\nOnly U, D, or R, but R invalid, U and D have food, but eating them leads to death as above.\n\nU to (6,6) eat, then stuck.\n\nD to (6,4) eat, then stuck.\n\nNo other moves? (6,5) has only three possible directions since left is body or wall, but L is (5,5) body, so only U and D, which have food or could be.\n\nBut if I move to (6,6) without eating? (6,6) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4).\n\nSo from (6,5), I have to move to U or D, both have food, so I eat, and then get stuck.\n\nBut that can't be right; I must have a way to avoid this.\n\nFrom earlier, at turn 3, I am at (5,5) with body at (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), instead of moving R to (6,5), I could move other ways, but at (5,5), moves: U (5,6) wall, D (5,4) wall, L (4,5) body, R (6,5) free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,5), no choice.\n\nThen at (6,5), I must move to (6,6) or (6,4), both eat and die.\n\nSo this path leads to death after eating the food at (4,5) and then getting to (6,5).\n\nBut I ate one food, but then died, so not good for long-term.\n\nI need to choose a different initial move or path.\n\nAt turn 1, from (3,4), instead of going R to (4,4), I could go other directions.\n\nFrom (3,4) dir U, I can go U to (3,5), or L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go U to (3,5) at turn 1.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5) — snake at (3,5), dir U\n\nThen at (3,5), as before, can move U, but (3,6) wall, invalid; D to (3,4); L to (2,5); R to (4,5) which has food.\n\nSo I can move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5) — eat, head at (4,5), body at (3,5), dir R? Moved right, so dir R.\n\nThen from (4,5), same as before, can move U to (4,6) dead end, or L to (3,5) body, collision, or R to (5,5), or D to (4,4) but (4,4) is free? No body yet.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (3,5)\n\nMove to (5,5): free, not body.\n\nOr to (4,4): free.\n\nOr to (4,6): free.\n\nBut (4,6) dead end as before.\n\nIf move to (5,5), then same as before, to (6,5), stuck.\n\nIf move to (4,4), from (4,5) dir R, move D to (4,4).\n\nThen new head (4,4), body moves to (4,5), so snake [(4,4), (4,5)], dir D.\n\nThen from (4,4), can move U to (4,5) body, collision; D to (4,3); L to (3,4); R to (5,4) wall.\n\n(5,4) wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,3): free? (4,3) not wall, but (5,3) wall, but (4,3) free.\n\nL to (3,4): free.\n\nU to (4,5) body, invalid.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nSay move D to (4,3), then to (4,2), etc., but food is elsewhere.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nBack to turn 0, I have another choice: move D to (3,2).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) — snake at (3,2), dir D\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2) dir D, can move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1) free, (2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nFood at (4,5), so I need to go up.\n\nSay move R to (4,2) at turn 1.\n\nThen at (4,2), dir R.\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (4,3) — free? (4,3) not wall.\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (4,4) — free.\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (4,5) — eat food.\n\nSo turn 4 eat at (4,5).\n\nSimilar to before, but later.\n\nThen same problem as before.\n\nFrom (4,2), I could go other ways, but still, I need to get to the food.\n\nBut the issue is after eating (4,5), I might get stuck if I go to (4,6).\n\nTo avoid that, from (4,5), I should not go up, but go to (3,5) or (5,5), but (5,5) leads to (6,5) problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,5) first.\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5), as I thought earlier.\n\nThen at (3,5), dir L.\n\nThen can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5), as U and R invalid or body.\n\nMove D to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut not towards other food.\n\nMove L to (2,5), then to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut food at (6,4) and (6,6) are far.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time, but I need to plan a path to eat multiple food.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (4,5) immediately and go for other food first.\n\nFor example, go for (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), which is near the right wall.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then I can go right, but with obstacles.\n\nAt turn 0, move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1, instead of R to (4,4), move U to (3,5)\n\nThen at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) to eat, or D to (3,4).\n\nIf I don't eat, say move R to (4,5) to eat at turn 2, same as before.\n\nOr move L to (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nThen at (2,5), dir L.\n\nThen can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU: (2,6) — free? Walls: (1,6) wall, but (2,6) not listed, should be free.\n\nD: (2,4) — free\n\nL: (1,5) — free, not wall\n\nR: not possible.\n\nSo move, say, to (1,5) L.\n\nThen at (1,5), etc., but this is left, away from food.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo reach (6,4), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) to eat, but then stuck with body.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,5) later.\n\nBut it has life span 10, so I can come back.\n\nBut let's think about the grid layout.\n\nList the wall cells to see free space.\n\nGrid:\n\nRows y=7 to y=0, but y=7 top, y=0 bottom.\n\nColumns x=0 left to x=7 right.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Left: x=0, all y\n\n- Right: x=7, all y\n\n- Bottom: y=0, all x\n\n- Top: y=7, all x\n\nInternal: (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (3,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6)\n\nSo for example, at y=3, walls at (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), (5,4) is at y=4, etc.\n\nFree cells are limited.\n\nFor instance, to go to (6,4), from (3,3), I can go via (4,3) but (4,3) is free, then (5,3) wall, so cannot.\n\n(5,3) wall, so I cannot go directly right at y=3.\n\nI have to go above or below.\n\nBelow, y=2, (4,2) free, (5,2) free? (5,2) not wall, yes.\n\nThen to (6,2), etc.\n\nAbove, y=4, (4,4) free, but (5,4) wall, so cannot go to x=5 at y=4.\n\nAt y=5, (4,5) free, (5,5) free, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nSo to reach (6,4), I can go to (6,5) then down, or (6,3) then up, but (6,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nBut with the snake, after growing, it might block.\n\nSince the snake is short now, I can go for (6,4) or (6,6) first.\n\nLet's try to go for (6,4) from start.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,4) — as before.\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (4,3) — (4,3) free? Yes.\n\nThen at (4,3), dir D.\n\nThen turn 3: move D to (4,2) — free.\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (5,2) — (5,2) free? Walls: (5,3) wall, but (5,2) not, so free.\n\nThen turn 5: move R to (6,2) — free.\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (6,3) — free.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,4) — eat food at (6,4).\n\nNow, at turn 7, eat at (6,4), snake grows to length 2, head at (6,4), body at (6,3)? Before move, head at (6,3)? Let's trace positions.\n\nStart turn 0: move U to (3,4) — snake at (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4) — snake at (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3) — snake at (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (4,2) — snake at (4,2)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,2) — snake at (5,2)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,2) — snake at (6,2)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (6,3) — snake at (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,4) — eat food, so head at (6,4), body at (6,3), length 2. Dir U.\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) body, collision, L to (5,4) wall, R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo only U to (6,5).\n\nMove to (6,5), new head (6,5), body moves to (6,4), so snake [(6,5), (6,4)], dir U.\n\nThen at (6,5), as before, can move U to (6,6) eat, or D to (6,4) body, collision, L to (5,5), or R to (7,5) wall.\n\nL to (5,5): free, not wall or body.\n\nSo I can move L to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), as before, can move R to (6,5) body, collision, U to (5,6) wall, D to (5,4) wall, L to (4,5) which may be free.\n\n(4,5) has food, but it might be eaten or not.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, food at (4,5) life span 10, so at turn 7, life span decreased by 7, so 10-7=3? Life span at turn 0 is 10, so at turn 1, life span 9, ..., at turn 7, life span 10-7=3, so still there for 3 more turns.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 10, at turn 7, life span 3.\n\nSo (4,5) is still available.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has food, so I eat it.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (4,5) — eat, head at (4,5), body at (5,5), and (6,4)? Before move, head (5,5), body (6,4)\n\nMove to (4,5), eat food, so head to (4,5), body: since eat, length increases, so body remains, new head, so snake [(4,5), (5,5), (6,4)]? Positions: head was (5,5), body (6,4), move to (4,5), so new head (4,5), body at (5,5), and since eat, tail doesn't move, so (6,4) is still there, so snake [(4,5), (5,5), (6,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDir L.\n\nThen from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) body, collision.\n\n(4,6) free, (4,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nBut (4,6) is dead end as before.\n\nIf I go to (4,4), or (3,5).\n\n(6,6) food is still there.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (3,5) L.\n\nThen at (3,5), dir L, then to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is far.\n\nMove to (4,4) D.\n\nThen from (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I can go to (4,6) but dead.\n\nSo not good.\n\nFrom (6,5), after eating (6,4), I moved to (6,5), then to (5,5), then ate (4,5), but then I have the body at (6,4), which is far, so when I'm at (4,5), the tail is at (6,4), so I have space.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n\nU to (4,6) is dangerous because from (4,6), only down to (4,5) which is body, or other walls, so dead.\n\nSo better to move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\nSay move D to (4,4).\n\nThen head to (4,4), body moves to (4,5), (5,5), so tail at (6,4) moves to (5,5)? Positions: before move, head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (6,4)\n\nMove head to (4,4), empty, no food, so head to (4,4), body moves: (5,5) to (4,5), (6,4) to (5,5), so snake [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nDir D.\n\nThen from (4,4), can move U to (4,5) body, collision; D to (4,3); L to (3,4); R to (5,4) wall.\n\nSo move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut there is food at (6,6), which I can go for later.\n\nLife span of (6,6) at turn 7 is 3, so by turn 10 it disappears.\n\nAt turn 8 I am at (4,4), turn 9 move to say (4,3), etc., it might take time to reach (6,6).\n\nFor example, from (4,4) to (6,6): via (5,5), but (5,5) is body now? In the positions, at some point (5,5) is occupied.\n\nIn this state, at turn 8 after move to (4,4), snake at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), so (5,5) occupied.\n\nTo go to (6,6), I need to move to (5,5) but it's body, or go around.\n\nFor example, move to (4,3) D, then to (5,3) but (5,3) wall, cannot.\n\nMove to (3,4) L, then to (3,5), but (3,5) may be free or not.\n\nComplicated.\n\nPerhaps for the initial choice, moving down to (3,2) is better to avoid the dead end area.\n\nLet's try move D at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) — snake at (3,2), dir D\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,2) — snake at (4,2), dir R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) — snake at (4,3), dir U\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,4) — snake at (4,4), dir U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (4,5) — eat food, head at (4,5), body at (4,4), dir U\n\nThen from here, instead of U, move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nSay move L to (3,5) at turn 5.\n\nHead to (3,5), body to (4,5), so snake [(3,5), (4,5)], dir L\n\nThen at (3,5), move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\nMove D to (3,4) turn 6.\n\nHead to (3,4), body to (3,5), snake [(3,4), (3,5)], dir D\n\nThen turn 7: move D to (3,3) — free, snake at (3,3), but (3,3) is free, no food, so head to (3,3), body to (3,4), snake [(3,3), (3,4)], dir D\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut no food eaten since, and (6,4) and (6,6) are still there.\n\nLife span at turn 7: for (6,4) and (6,6), life span at turn 0 is 10, so at turn 7, 10-7=3, so available until turn 9.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at (3,3), I can go to (4,3), then (5,2), etc., to reach (6,4) by turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut turn 9 is the last turn to eat, since life span 10 at turn 0, disappears after 10 turns, so at turn 10 it's gone, so I can eat up to turn 9.\n\nAt turn 7, position (3,3), to (6,4): need 3 moves right and 1 up, but with obstacles, so path like (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) but (6,4) food, so eat at (6,4) on turn 11? Turn 7 to turn 11 is 4 turns, turn 7 to 8,9,10,11, so turn 11 is too late, as food disappears at turn 10.\n\nTurn 0: life span 10, so:\n\nTurn 0: life span 10\n\nTurn 1: life span 9\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: life span 1\n\nTurn 10: life span 0, disappears, so not available at turn 10.\n\nSo I can eat up to turn 9.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at (3,3), to reach (6,4) in 2 moves: minimum Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| =3+1=4, so at least 4 moves, but I need to eat by turn 9, so from turn 7 to turn 9 is 2 moves, so I can reach in 2 moves only if adjacent, but not, so impossible to eat (6,4) or (6,6) by turn 9 from (3,3) at turn 7.\n\nFor example, turn 7: at (3,3), move R to (4,3) turn 8\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,4) or something, not to (6,4).\n\nTo (6,4) in 2 moves from (3,3): impossible, min 3 moves, e.g. (4,3), (5,3) wall, so not direct.\n\nVia (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then to (6,3) on turn 9, then turn 10 to (6,4) but turn 10 food gone, so I can't eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nSo if I go down first, I might miss the other food.\n\nBut with the first approach, I can eat (6,4) by turn 7, as I did earlier.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (6,4) at turn 7, then (4,5) at turn 8, and (6,6) is still there, but at turn 8, (6,6) life span 2, so can eat by turn 9.\n\nAfter eating (4,5) at turn 8, I am at (4,5) with body at (5,5) and (6,4), so positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,4)\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (3,5) L or (4,4) D.\n\nSay move to (3,5) L.\n\nThen at (3,5), dir L, snake head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), so (6,4) moves to (5,5)? After move to (3,5), head to (3,5), body moves: (4,5) to (4,5)? Positions: before move, head (4,5), body (5,5), tail (6,4)\n\nMove head to (3,5), empty, no food, so head to (3,5), body moves: (5,5) to (4,5), (6,4) to (5,5), so snake [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nDir L.\n\nThen at (3,5), can move D to (3,4), L to (2,5), U wall, R body.\n\nMove D to (3,4) turn 9.\n\nHead to (3,4), body to (3,5), (4,5), so snake [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nDir D.\n\nThen turn 10: move to (3,3) D, etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), I can go to it.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 9, I can move to (4,5) but body, or other.\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (3,5) at turn 9: Manhattan distance 3+1=4, need 4 moves, but turn 9 to turn 12, but food disappears at turn 10, so I can't eat it.\n\nAt turn 8, after eating (4,5), I am at (4,5), turn 8.\n\n(6,6) life span at turn 8: 10-8=2, so can eat by turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 8, to (6,6) in 1 move? Not adjacent, min 2 moves, e.g. to (5,5) then to (6,6), but (5,5) is body at that time.\n\nIn the positions, body at (5,5) and (6,4), so (5,5) occupied, so I cannot move to (5,5).\n\nOther paths: to (4,6) U, then to (5,6) but (5,6) wall, cannot.\n\nTo (3,5) L, then to (2,5), not towards (6,6).\n\nSo no way to reach (6,6) in one move from (4,5), and in two moves, the only path is via (5,5) which is occupied, so impossible to eat (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, in the first path, I ate (6,4) and (4,5), but missed (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is also positive food, so I should try to eat all.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,6) first.\n\nLet's go back to turn 0.\n\nMove U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move U not possible, so move R to (4,5) to eat or not.\n\nIf not eat, move L to (2,5)\n\nBut then I waste turns.\n\nTurn 2 move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nThen at (4,5), head, body (3,5)\n\nThen move R to (5,5) turn 3.\n\nThen move R to (6,5) turn 4.\n\nThen at (6,5), move U to (6,6) to eat at turn 5.\n\nThen at (6,6), head, body (6,5), (5,5)\n\nBut from (6,6), as before, all moves invalid, die immediately.\n\nSo I eat but die.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid dying, from (6,5), don't eat, but I have to move, and only U or D, both have food, so I must eat and die.\n\nSo the problem is that (6,6) and (6,4) are at the edge, and after eating, I have no escape if the body is behind.\n\nBut if the body is not directly behind, I might have space.\n\nFor example, if I approach (6,6) from the left or below with the tail elsewhere.\n\nBut with short snake, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps for now, since the snake is short, I can eat (4,5) first, then avoid the edge food if it's risky.\n\nBut all food is +1, so I should eat when possible.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, move D to (3,2), then go to the bottom, but food is all at top, so not good.\n\nOr, from (3,3), move U to (3,4), then at turn 1 move L to (2,4), then to (2,5), etc., but not towards food.\n\nI think the best is to eat (4,5) and then go for (6,4) or something, but as in the first path, I can eat both (6,4) and (4,5) without dying immediately, and then I have a length 3 snake, and I can explore other areas.\n\nIn the first path, after eating (6,4) at turn 7 and (4,5) at turn 8, I am at (4,5) with body at (5,5) and (6,4), so I can move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5), and then I have the bottom and left areas to explore, and no other food, so I can survive for a while.\n\nThe food will respawn or something? The state doesn't say, but I think for now, with the given food, I can eat two and then survive.\n\nThere is also (6,6), but I may not be able to eat it in time.\n\nLife span 10, at turn 8, (6,6) life span 2, so if I can eat it at turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 8, I can only move to (3,5) or (4,4), both not towards (6,6), so impossible.\n\nSo I can eat two out of three food items.\n\nThen with length 3, I can continue moving.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) turn 8, move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,4) move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4)\n\n etc.\n\nAnd avoid walls.\n\nSo for turn 0, I think moving up is better to reach food faster.\n\nSo I'll go with move U at turn 0.\n\nThen for turn 1, move R to (4,4) to set up for (4,5).\n\nThen turn 2 move U to (4,5) to eat.\n\nThen from there, to avoid dead end, move R to (5,5) at turn 3.\n\nThen turn 4 move R to (6,5).\n\nThen at (6,5), move L to (5,5) but body, or U to (6,6) eat and die, or D to (6,4) eat and then stuck.\n\nBut if I move D to (6,4) to eat, then at (6,4), I can move D to (6,3), as before, then to (6,2), etc., down to the bottom.\n\nFrom (6,4) after eating, head at (6,4), body at (6,5), (5,5)\n\nThen move D to (6,3), head to (6,3), body to (6,4), (6,5), so tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,3), move D to (6,2), and so on, down to (6,0) wall, but I can move left when possible.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nSo I can survive, but in a limited space.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,6), I die immediately, so better to go down.\n\nSo in the sequence, from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat, then move D to (6,3), etc.\n\nSo for turn 0, move U.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many to list, but probably for the immediate turns, say 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the current and future turns in the answer.\n\nBut since the state changes, I need to output a sequence.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan the first few moves.\n\nSo turn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nBut at turn 5, move D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (6,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 5 or so.\n\nSince head direction changes, I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, from (4,5) to (5,5), move R.\n\nTurn 4 from (5,5) to (6,5), move R.\n\nTurn 5 from (6,5) to (6,4), move D.\n\nNow, at turn 5, after eating (6,4), I am at (6,4), then move D to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think listing 5 turns is sufficient.\n\nThe current turn is t1=0, so actions for turn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 2 I eat (4,5), turn 5 I eat (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is not eaten, but I can't reach it safely.\n\nSo for the initial action, move U at turn 0.\n\nThen for turn 1, move R.\n\n etc.\n\nBut in the state, there is also (6,6) food, but with the path, I can't eat it, so I'll ignore for now.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (4,5) later and go for (6,6) first, but it's riskier.\n\nI think the above is fine.\n\nSo for turn 0: move U\n\nTurn 1: move R\n\nTurn 2: move U\n\nThen for turn 3, from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4)\n\nBut at turn 5, move D to (6,4), which has food, so eat.\n\nThen for future, but I can stop at turn 5.\n\nSince the snake is at (6,5) at turn 4, I could move U to (6,6) at turn 5, but that causes death, so better not.\n\nSo move D to (6,4).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nBut at turn 2, when I move U to (4,5), I eat, so the action is U.\n\nSimilarly, turn 5 move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the grid layout, food positions, and potential risks. The current state at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) has the snake at position (3,3) with direction left, and no body segments. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). Food is at (6,4), (4,5), and (6,6), all with value +1 and life span 10.\n\n### Key Planning Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 0)**: From (3,3) with direction left, possible moves are up (U), down (D), or left (L), but not right (R, instant reverse). Left to (2,3) is blocked by a wall, so only U to (3,4) or D to (3,2) are valid. Moving up (U) is prioritized to access the food at (4,5) quickly and avoid the riskier bottom area near obstacles like (2,1).\n- **Food Access**: The food at (4,5) is reachable in 2 turns (e.g., via (3,4) and (4,4)). Eating it early grows the snake to length 2, enabling more efficient scoring. The food at (6,4) can be eaten later, but (6,6) is riskier due to edge constraints and may not be reachable safely within its life span.\n- **Risks and Dead Ends**: After eating at (4,5), moving up to (4,6) leads to a dead end (surrounded by walls/body). Instead, moving right to (5,5) and then to (6,5) provides access to (6,4) while avoiding immediate traps. From (6,5), moving down to (6,4) to eat is safe, as the snake can then proceed down to open areas.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has life span 10 at turn 0, disappearing after turn 9. The path ensures (4,5) is eaten by turn 2 and (6,4) by turn 5, utilizing the life span efficiently. (6,6) is not targeted due to high risk of death after eating and insufficient time to reach it safely from other positions.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence below covers turns 0 to 5, ensuring the snake eats two food items, grows to length 3, and positions itself for survival:\n  - **Turn 0**: Move U to (3,4) – Starts path toward (4,5), avoids down direction which leads away from food.\n  - **Turn 1**: Move R to (4,4) – Positions to eat (4,5) next turn; no risk as snake is short.\n  - **Turn 2**: Move U to (4,5) – Eats positive food; snake grows to length 2 (head at (4,5), body at (4,4)).\n  - **Turn 3**: Move R to (5,5) – Avoids dead end at (4,6); heads toward (6,4) with body trailing.\n  - **Turn 4**: Move R to (6,5) – Approaches (6,4); safe as (6,5) is open.\n  - **Turn 5**: Move D to (6,4) – Eats positive food; snake grows to length 3. Then, the snake can move down to (6,3) for survival.\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 5 and ensures long-term survival by:\n- Avoiding walls and body collisions (e.g., no move to (4,6) or (6,6)).\n- Leaving open paths for movement after turn 5 (e.g., down to (6,3), then left or down).\n- Prioritizing safe food access over risky edge food like (6,6).\n\n### Answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up)  \nTurn 1: R (right)  \nTurn 2: U (up)  \nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the grid size.\n\nThe border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, but the cells inside are from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). But (0,0) to (7,7) are the coordinates, and walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n\nSnake positions: only one segment? [(3,4)] That means the snake has only a head, no body. Because it's a list with one position: (3,4). And head direction is Up.\n\nSnake head direction: U, which is up.\n\nFood positions: three with value 1 and life span 9, 9, 10? Let's list them:\n\n- (6,4,9,1) — I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). So (6,4) with life 9, value +1\n\n- (4,5,9,1) — (4,5) life 9, value +1\n\n- (6,6,9,1) — (6,6) life 9, value +1\n\n- (3,1,10,1) — (3,1) life 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, no negative food mentioned. And life spans are 9,9,9,10, so they'll disappear after that many turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=1.\n\nNow, snake is at (3,4), head direction up. Since it's only one segment, it has no body, so no collision risk with itself yet. But when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,4): Up, Down, Left, Right. But since head direction is Up, and there's no instant reverse, I cannot move Down immediately because that would be opposite to current direction. Current direction U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move Down this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, what are the adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,5) — y+1 since U is (x,y+1)\n\nIn the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nSo from (3,4):\n\n- U: (3,5)\n\n- D: (3,3) — but cannot move D because of no instant reverse\n\n- L: (2,4)\n\n- R: (4,4)\n\nNow, check for walls or obstacles.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells like (0,y) or (x,0) etc. are invalid.\n\nBut (3,5): x=3, y=5, both between 1 and 6? y=5, min y is 1? Grid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so snake can be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Therefore, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo for (3,5): x=3, y=5. Is this a wall? Borders: x=3 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): x=2,y=4, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), etc. (2,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4, no obstacle.\n\n(3,3): cannot move there anyway.\n\nAlso, since snake has only head, no body to collide with.\n\nNow, food positions: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6), (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is food, but that's far.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all cells.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\ny=1 bottom? Usually in grids, y=0 might be bottom, but here walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y from 1 to 6. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut head direction U, which is increasing y? U is (x,y+1), so if y increases up, then y=6 is top, y=1 bottom.\n\nIn the movement, U (x,y+1), so y+1 means up if we consider y=0 bottom, but since walls at y=0 and y=7, and y=7 is top? Let's see coordinates.\n\nFor example, food at (3,1), which is low y, so probably y=1 is bottom row, y=6 top row.\n\nSimilarly, snake at (3,4), which is middle.\n\nHead direction U, so moving to higher y.\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nNow, let's see what's around.\n\nFirst, food at (4,5) which is one step right and one up? From (3,4), (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,5) up, (2,4) left, (4,4) right, (3,3) down but invalid.\n\n(4,5) is food, but not directly adjacent; to reach it, I need to go right then up or up then right, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is to the right, same y, x=6.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\n(3,1) is down left, but far.\n\n(6,6) is top right.\n\nSince snake has no body, I can go to any direction except down.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, life spans: food at (6,4) life 9, (4,5) life 9, (6,6) life 9, (3,1) life 10. All have many turns left, so no immediate expiration.\n\nNow, for the snake, since it's only head, eating food will make it grow to length 2.\n\nBut in this case, when it eats, it grows, so the tail becomes the previous position, but since it was only head, after eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so positions become [new head, old head].\n\nFor example, if I move to a food cell, snake grows.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, no tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but no body now.\n\nI should consider moving towards food, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nFirst, internal obstacles: list them:\n\n(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo:\n\n- (3,6): x=3,y=6\n\n- (2,1): x=2,y=1\n\n- (1,3): x=1,y=3\n\n- (2,3): x=2,y=3\n\n- (5,6): x=5,y=6\n\n- (5,3): x=5,y=3\n\n- (5,4): x=5,y=4\n\n- (1,6): x=1,y=6\n\nNow, border walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells outside playable area.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nNow, let's mark obstacles on grid:\n\nRow y=6: x=1: obstacle (1,6), x=2: free? x=3: obstacle (3,6), x=4: free, x=5: obstacle (5,6), x=6: free? But y=6, not border wall since border is y=7.\n\nBorder walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so y=6 is playable if not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: x=1: free? (2,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) is at x=2,y=1. So for y=1: x=1: free? No obstacle listed, so free. x=2: obstacle (2,1), x=3: free, etc.\n\nList all playable cells and obstacles.\n\nCreate a grid mentally:\n\nColumns x=1 to 6, rows y=1 to 6 (y=1 bottom, y=6 top)\n\n- y=6: (1,6) obstacle, (2,6) free? Not listed, so free. (3,6) obstacle, (4,6) free, (5,6) obstacle, (6,6) free but has food? (6,6) is food, but food is on free cell, obstacles are separate.\n\nFood positions are on free cells, I assume.\n\n(6,6) has food, and it's not obstacle, so cell is free but has food.\n\nSimilarly, obstacles are blocked.\n\nSo for y=6 row:\n\nx=1: obstacle (1,6)\n\nx=2: free\n\nx=3: obstacle (3,6)\n\nx=4: free\n\nx=5: obstacle (5,6)\n\nx=6: free and has food (6,6)\n\ny=5: no obstacles listed, so all free except where food? Food at (4,5) and (6,4) but (6,4) is y=4.\n\ny=5: x=1 to 6 all free? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4) are at y=3 and y=4, not y=5. So y=5: all x free.\n\nBut food at (4,5), so (4,5) has food.\n\ny=4: snake at (3,4), food at (6,4), obstacles: (5,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) blocked.\n\ny=4 row:\n\nx=1: free\n\nx=2: free? (2,3) is y=3, not here.\n\n(2,3) is at y=3.\n\ny=4: x=1 free, x=2 free, x=3 snake, x=4 free, x=5 obstacle (5,4), x=6 food (6,4)\n\ny=3: obstacles (1,3), (2,3), (5,3)\n\ny=3 row: x=1 obstacle (1,3), x=2 obstacle (2,3), x=3 free, x=4 free, x=5 obstacle (5,3), x=6 free\n\ny=2: no obstacles listed, so all free.\n\ny=1: obstacles (2,1), and x=1 free, x=2 obstacle (2,1), x=3 free, x=4 free, x=5 free, x=6 free? And food at (3,1)\n\ny=1 row: x=1 free, x=2 obstacle (2,1), x=3 food (3,1), x=4 free, x=5 free, x=6 free\n\nAlso, border walls around, but not playable.\n\nSnake at (3,4), head U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nNow, (2,4): at y=4, x=2, free, no food.\n\n(3,5): at x=3,y=5, free, no food.\n\n(4,4): at x=4,y=4, free, no food.\n\nNone of the adjacent cells have food directly. Food is at (4,5), which is from (3,4), not adjacent; (4,5) is one right, one up.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is right, but (4,4) is to the right, then I can go to (5,4) but (5,4) is obstacle, so cannot go to (5,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), R to (4,4), then from there, possible moves: U to (4,5) which has food, or L back to (3,4), or R to (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, so cannot, or D to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, x=4, which is free.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4) U to (3,5), then from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, or D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) which has food.\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\nFrom (3,4) L to (2,4), then from (2,4), I can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3) but (2,3) obstacle, L to (1,4), or R to (3,4).\n\n(1,4) is free? y=4,x=1, no obstacle, so free.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should aim to eat food to grow, but carefully to avoid traps.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their positions:\n\n- F1: (6,4) value +1, life 9\n\n- F2: (4,5) value +1, life 9\n\n- F3: (6,6) value +1, life 9\n\n- F4: (3,1) value +1, life 10\n\nAll have high life, so I have time.\n\nBut the snake is small, so eating food will grow it.\n\nI should move towards the nearest food or one that is easy to get.\n\n(4,5) is close: from (3,4), if I go R to (4,4), then U to (4,5) to eat it on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), from (3,4) I can go R to (4,4), then I need to go to (5,4) but (5,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly right. I have to go down or up to bypass.\n\n(6,4) is at same y, x=6, but (5,4) blocked, so to reach (6,4), I need to go via other paths, like down to (4,3) or up to (4,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is far, (3,1) is far.\n\n(4,5) is the closest food, only two moves away: move right to (4,4) then up to (4,5).\n\nBut after eating, snake will grow.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1, snake at (3,4), direction U.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 1.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (4,4)\n\nThen, on turn 2, from (4,4), direction now R? After move, head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), head direction is R (right).\n\nThen, from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) which has food, D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: since I moved R, I cannot move L immediately next turn? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent direction after move is the direction I just moved.\n\nAfter moving R to (4,4), head direction is R.\n\nThen next turn, I cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite to R.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R. But R to (5,4) obstacle, so only U, D possible.\n\nU to (4,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nD to (4,3) no food.\n\nSo if I move R on turn 1, then on turn 2 I can move U to (4,5) and eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: positions were [(3,4)], after move to (4,4) on turn 1, positions: head at (4,4), but when I move to (4,4), since no food there, snake doesn't grow, so still length 1, position [(4,4)].\n\nThen on turn 2, move to (4,5), which has food, so eat, grow to length 2: positions now [(4,5), (4,4)] head at (4,5), tail at (4,4).\n\nHead direction after move to (4,5) is U.\n\nLife span of that food decreases each turn, but we eat on turn 2, life was 9, so it was there.\n\nNow, after eating, I have a body.\n\nThen I need to move on.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nIf I move U on turn 1 to (3,5).\n\nThen head direction U.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) but obstacle, cannot; D to (3,4) but no instant reverse? Current direction U, moving D would be opposite, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (2,5), or R to (4,5) which has food.\n\n(4,5) has food, so I can move R to (4,5) on turn 2 and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,4) on turn 1.\n\nThen head direction L.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves: U to (2,5), D to (2,3) but (2,3) obstacle, cannot; L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but no instant reverse, since moved L, cannot move R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L. But D to (2,3) obstacle, so only U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n\nNo food at (2,5) or (1,4), so I don't eat immediately.\n\nBut (2,5) is free, (1,4) free.\n\nThen later I can go to food.\n\nBut moving to (4,5) is faster to eat food.\n\nSimilarly, from R move, I can eat on turn 2.\n\nFrom U move, I can also eat on turn 2 by moving R to (4,5).\n\nFrom L move, I cannot eat on turn 2.\n\nSo moving L on turn 1 delays eating.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I am at (4,5) with body at (4,4), head direction U.\n\nThen I need to move.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) is tail, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nHead at (4,5), tail at (4,4).\n\nIf I move D to (4,4), that is where tail is, but when I move, head goes to (4,4), and tail moves away? When head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, else just moves.\n\nBut moving to tail cell: since the tail will move forward, if I move head to the current tail position, and since the tail moves, it might not collide, but in this case, (4,4) is the tail, and if I move head to (4,4), at the same time, the tail should move to the next, but since it's only one body segment, after head moves to (4,4), the body segment at (4,4) would be, let's think.\n\nPositions: before move, head (4,5), body [(4,5), (4,4)] no, positions: head (4,5), tail (4,4), so segments: index 0 head (4,5), index 1 tail (4,4).\n\nWhen I move head to a new position, say to (4,6), then new positions: head at (4,6), and tail moves to where the head was? In snake, when moving, the head moves to new cell, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, but if no growth, tail moves off.\n\nBut when growing, a new segment is added.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, if food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows. If no food, tail is removed, so snake moves.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,5) on turn 2, positions: [(4,5), (4,4)] head (4,5), tail (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 3, I move, say to (4,6). Since (4,6) has no food (assuming), so no growth, head moves to (4,6), and tail is removed, so positions become [(4,6), (4,5)]? Let's see: the body segment that was at (4,4) is removed, and the head moves to (4,6), so the new tail is the previous head position (4,5).\n\nSo positions: head (4,6), body (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,4) from (4,5), but (4,4) is the current tail position.\n\nIf I move head to (4,4), which is where tail is, but at the same time, since no food, tail should move off. But when head moves to (4,4), and tail is at (4,4), it might cause collision.\n\nIn snake, moving head to the tail cell is usually safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n\nBut in this rules, it says: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it should be safe.\n\nBut only if it's the tail, not other body parts.\n\nHere, (4,4) is tail, so moving to (4,4) should be ok, but after move, head at (4,4), and tail was at (4,4), but since tail moves to the next, but in this case, since it's only one body segment, after head moves to (4,4), the tail segment is removed, so positions become head at (4,4), and no body, but that means the snake shrinks? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nInitial: positions [(4,5), (4,4)] length 2.\n\nI move head to (4,4). Since (4,4) has no food (we ate the food earlier, so no food there now), so no growth. Therefore, head moves to (4,4), and the tail segment at (4,4) is removed? But the tail is at (4,4), and head is moving to it.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new cell, and if no food, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo if head moves to the current tail cell, since the tail is leaving that cell, it should be empty when head arrives, so no collision.\n\nPositions: before move: head at (4,5), tail at (4,4)\n\nMove head to (4,4): now head is at (4,4), and since no growth, the tail is removed, so the snake now has only head at (4,4), length 1 again? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake movement:\n\n- When the head moves to a new cell:\n\n  - If the cell has food, the snake grows: the new head is at the food cell, and the tail remains, so the body extends; positions: new head at food, then previous head, then body.\n\n  - If no food, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed from its current position, so the body shifts; positions: new head at new cell, then the previous head becomes neck, and the tail segment is discarded.\n\nIn this case, with two segments: positions [head, tail]\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without food:\n\nNew positions: [new_head, old_head]  because the tail was removed, and old head becomes the body.\n\nExample: positions [(4,5), (4,4)] head at (4,5), tail at (4,4)\n\nMove head to (4,6), no food: new head at (4,6), and since no growth, tail is removed, so the body is only the previous head, which is (4,5), so new positions [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nNow, if I move head to (4,4) from (4,5):\n\nHead at (4,5), moving to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is the current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,4), and since no food there (assume), no growth, so tail is removed. The tail was at (4,4), so it is removed, and the new body is the previous head (4,5), but the previous head is now the body segment.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,4), and the only body segment is at (4,5), so [(4,4), (4,5)]\n\nSo the snake is now at (4,4) and (4,5), with head at (4,4), which is below the body.\n\nAnd no collision because the tail was removed before head moved in, or simultaneously.\n\nIn terms of collision, during the move, head enters (4,4) as tail leaves, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly in this case.\n\nBut in this position, head at (4,4), body at (4,5), so the body is above the head.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFirst, at turn 1, I can choose to move to (4,4) or (3,5) or (2,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,4), I can eat (4,5) on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,5), I can move to (4,5) on turn 2 to eat.\n\nIf I move to (2,4), I don't eat immediately.\n\nSince eating quickly is good to grow, I should go for (4,5) soon.\n\nBut let's see the grid after eating.\n\nAfter eating at (4,5) on turn 2, positions: [(4,5), (4,4)] head at (4,5), direction U (since I moved up to it).\n\nThen on turn 3, I need to move.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,6): y=6, x=4, which is free? y=6 row: x=4 is free, no obstacle, no food mentioned, so free.\n\nD to (4,4): which is the tail, but as we said, it should be safe, but (4,4) is the current tail position.\n\nL to (3,5): free\n\nR to (5,5): but (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which should be free, no obstacle.\n\nBut (5,4) is obstacle, but (5,5) is different cell.\n\ny=5, all free as per earlier.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction U, so I cannot move D (down) immediately.\n\nSo cannot move D to (4,4).\n\nAllowed: U, L, R.\n\nNow, (4,6) is free, (3,5) free, (5,5) free.\n\nNo food adjacent.\n\nFood at (6,4), (6,6), (3,1)\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is top right.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), but to reach it, from (4,5), I can go R to (5,5), then down to (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nOr go L or U.\n\n(3,1) is bottom left.\n\nI need to think of a path to other food.\n\nAlso, after moving, the food life decreases.\n\nBut all have high life.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should consider the board state.\n\nAnother food at (6,6), which is at (6,6), and it's free.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), then from (4,6), I can go R to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or L to (3,6) obstacle, or D to (4,5) but reverse, or U not possible y=6 top, but y=6 is not wall, wall at y=7, so U to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: since y=6, U not possible (y+1=7 wall), D to (4,5), L to (3,6) obstacle, R to (5,6) obstacle, so only D to (4,5), but that is back.\n\nBut current direction: if I move U to (4,6), head direction U.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can only move D to (4,5), but D is opposite to U, so no instant reverse, I cannot move D immediately.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6) on turn 3 from (4,5).\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), head direction U.\n\nThen on turn 4, I need to move, but from (4,6), the only possible move is D to (4,5), but D is opposite to U, so I cannot move D because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nAnd other directions blocked: L to (3,6) obstacle, R to (5,6) obstacle, U to (4,7) wall.\n\nSo I am stuck, cannot move, and die.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) is a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, so row y=6, only x=2,4,6 free, but (2,6) and (6,6) free, but (4,6) is free but surrounded.\n\n(4,6) has no obstacles north, but y=7 wall, so it's a dead end if entered from south.\n\nSpecifically, from (4,5) moving U to (4,6), then next turn, I must move down but cannot because of reverse rule, and other directions blocked, so death.\n\nTherefore, I must not move to (4,6) when it is a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, for other cells.\n\nSo from (4,5), moving U to (4,6) is fatal.\n\nI should not do that.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells that might lead to dead ends.\n\nBack to turn 3 choices from (4,5): U is bad, so only L or R.\n\nL to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, (5,5) free.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5) but reverse, or U to (3,6) obstacle, or D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but same.\n\nBut after moving, head direction changes.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) from (4,5), head direction L.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) obstacle, cannot; D to (3,4), but current direction L, moving D is not opposite, opposite would be R, so I can move D.\n\nL to (2,5), R to (4,5) but no instant reverse, since moved L, cannot move R immediately.\n\nSo allowed: D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or U impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,5) from (4,5), head direction R.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) obstacle, cannot; D to (5,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (4,5), but no instant reverse, cannot; R to (6,5), which is free? x=6,y=5, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\ny=5 row all free, so (6,5) free.\n\nAlso, since moved R, cannot move L, so only possible move is R to (6,5).\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I can only go R to (6,5) next.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, if I move R to (4,4), then turn 2 move U to (4,5) eat food.\n\nThen turn 3 from (4,5) head U, I cannot move U to (4,6) as it's dead end, so I must move L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), then head direction L.\n\nThen turn 4 from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is where the tail was, but now it might be free.\n\nOr L to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,1) is below.\n\nAnother option at turn 1: move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 2, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) to eat food, same as before.\n\nOr move L to (2,5), but no food.\n\nSo moving U to (3,5) then R to (4,5) is similar to moving R then U.\n\nAfter eating at (4,5) on turn 2, I am at same position.\n\nIf at turn 1 I move L to (2,4), then turn 2, from (2,4) head L, I can move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n\nSay move U to (2,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 3 from (2,5), head U, I can move U to (2,6), or D to (2,4), or L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, (1,5) free, (3,5) free.\n\nBut to eat food, I need to go to (4,5) or other.\n\nBut (4,5) life 9, if I don't eat soon, it might disappear, but 9 turns, I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat as soon as possible.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has life 10.\n\nBut let's consider the dead end at (4,6).\n\nAlso, there might be other dead ends.\n\nFor example, (1,6) is obstacle, (1,5) might be ok.\n\nBut (1,6) obstacle, so from (1,5), I can go down, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid areas where I can get trapped.\n\nAnother food at (6,6), which is at (6,6), and it's free, but to reach it.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) if I get there.\n\n(6,6) is at y=6, x=6.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U not possible, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) obstacle, R to (7,6) wall, so only D to (6,5).\n\nBut if I enter from south, moving U to (6,6), then head direction U, then next turn I must move D but cannot because reverse, so same dead end as (4,6).\n\n(6,6) is also a dead end if entered from below.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) might be similar.\n\n(2,6): at x=2,y=6.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) obstacle, R to (3,6) obstacle, so only D to (2,5).\n\nIf I move U to (2,6) from (2,5), then head U, next turn must move D but cannot, die.\n\nSo all cells at y=6 except those with obstacles on sides are dead ends if entered from below.\n\nSpecifically, (2,6) can only be entered from south, and if I go U to it, I die next turn.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) and (6,6) same.\n\n(6,6) can be entered from left or below? L to (5,6) obstacle, so only from below or right, but right wall, so only from below.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) only from below, (2,6) only from below.\n\nSo I should avoid moving up to any y=6 cell, as it will kill me next turn.\n\nTherefore, from positions below, I should not move U to y=6.\n\nBack to turn 3 from (4,5), I cannot move U to (4,6).\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, if I move L to (3,5), head direction L.\n\nThen turn 4 from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) or U impossible, or R but no reverse.\n\nSay move D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, no food.\n\nThen positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,5)? After move from (3,5) to (3,4), no food, so head at (3,4), body at (3,5), head direction D.\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,4), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, moved D, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) is at y=3,x=3, free? y=3 row: x=3 free, as per earlier.\n\n(2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nFood at (3,1) is below, so I can go down to eat it eventually.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 4 from (3,5) I move L to (2,5), then head L, and so on.\n\nBut let's think of a plan to get multiple food.\n\nSince (4,5) is easy to eat, I should eat it on turn 2.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to other food without dying.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), but (5,4) obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), if I move R to (5,5) on turn 3.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,5), I can only move R to (6,5) because U obstacle, D obstacle, L reverse not allowed.\n\nMove to (6,5).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 5, from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) but (6,6) has food, and if I move U to (6,6), I eat it, but then I am at (6,6), head U, and next turn I must move D but cannot, so I die.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I eat (6,6) by moving U to it, I grow, but then stuck.\n\nPositions: before move to (6,6), say at (6,5), head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nMove U to (6,6), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nNew positions: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), length 2.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen on next turn, I need to move, but from (6,6), only possible move is D to (6,5), but D is opposite to U, so no instant reverse, cannot move D.\n\nOther directions blocked, so I die.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (6,6) if it means entering from below, because I will be trapped.\n\nSimilarly for any food at y=6, I cannot eat it by moving up to it; I must approach from another direction, but since y=6 has no cells above, and obstacles on sides, it's impossible to enter from side for (6,6), because left is obstacle, so only from below, which is deadly.\n\nTherefore, (6,6) is inedible; I should avoid it, or it will kill me when I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is at y=5, not top.\n\nBut (6,6) is a trap.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) has no food, but if I go there, same issue.\n\nSo for (6,6), since it has food, but eating it causes death, so I should not eat it.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, it's not that; here, the issue is that after eating, I am in a dead end.\n\nBut in this case, for (6,6), if I eat it, I am at (6,6) with no exit, and I cannot move next turn.\n\nSo it's a collision with wall or self? With wall because I cannot move, or self if I try to move but collide.\n\nBut specifically, since I cannot make a move, it's like wall collision or something.\n\nThe rules say deadly collisions include wall collision and body collision.\n\nHere, if no move is possible, it should be death.\n\nSo (6,6) should be avoided as a food to eat, because eating it traps me.\n\nSimilarly, any cell at y=6 except if I can enter and leave, but I can't.\n\nFor example, (2,6) no food, but if I go there, I die.\n\nSo I should stay away from y=6 row.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,6), same.\n\nSo back to turn 1.\n\nIf I eat (4,5) on turn 2, then on turn 3 from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), then turn 4 to (6,5), then turn 5 I can move to (6,6) and die, or move other directions.\n\nFrom (6,5), head at (6,5), direction R (after moving from (5,5) to (6,5)).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall, cannot.\n\nNo instant reverse: moved R, so cannot move L.\n\nAllowed: U, D, R. R wall, so U or D.\n\nU to (6,6) has food, but if I eat, I die next turn.\n\nD to (6,4), which has food? (6,4) has food with life 9.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, not top.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4), I can eat it if it's still there.\n\nLife span 9, turn 5, it might be there.\n\nBut let's sequence turns.\n\nTurn 1: move to (4,4) or (3,5), say (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) eat, positions [(4,5), (4,4)] head U\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5) head R\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5) head R\n\nTurn 5: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) which has food, so eat (6,4).\n\nThen after eating, head at (6,4), body at (6,5), positions [(6,4), (6,5)] head direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 6, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) which is body, but (6,5) is the body segment, so if I move U to (6,5), I collide with body.\n\nD to (6,3), L to (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, cannot, R to (7,4) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at y=3,x=6, free? y=3 row: x=6 free, no obstacle.\n\nSo I can move D to (6,3).\n\nThen no issue.\n\nBut on turn 5, I ate (6,4), so I grew.\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), tail removed, so positions: head (6,3), body (6,4).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I ate two food, length 3 now? Let's count.\n\nStart length 1.\n\nEat (4,5) on turn 2, length 2.\n\nEat (6,4) on turn 5, length 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go down to (3,1) or other.\n\nBut (3,1) is food.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is there, but I cannot eat it safely.\n\nNow, back to turn 1 choice.\n\nIf I move U on turn 1 to (3,5), then turn 2 move R to (4,5) eat, same as above.\n\nOr if I move L on turn 1 to (2,4), then I don't eat immediately.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move L to (2,4) head L.\n\nTurn 2, from (2,4), move U to (2,5) head U (since U is not opposite, moved L, so U allowed).\n\nThen at (2,5), no food.\n\nTurn 3, from (2,5) head U, I can move U to (2,6) but (2,6) is dead end, if I move U, I die next turn.\n\nMove D to (2,4) but reverse, cannot since head U.\n\nMove L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n\nSay move R to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), I can then go to (4,5) to eat on turn 4 or later.\n\nBut (4,5) life 9, turn 4, it decreases by 3 turns? From turn 1 to turn 4, life decreases by 3, so if life span 9, on turn 4 it has 6 left, still there.\n\nBut I eat later, so I might miss other opportunities.\n\nTo maximize, eating sooner is better to grow and be able to reach other food.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might not be faster.\n\nAnother food at (3,1), which is close to (2,4) or (3,4).\n\nFor example, from start (3,4), if I move L to (2,4) turn 1, then turn 2 move D to (2,3) but (2,3) obstacle, cannot.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves: U to (2,5), D to (2,3) obstacle, L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but no reverse.\n\nSo cannot move D.\n\nMove U or L.\n\nIf move L to (1,4), then from (1,4), I can go U to (1,5), D to (1,3), but (1,3) obstacle, so D cannot, L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4), but no reverse.\n\nSo from (1,4), head L, can move U or R? Allowed: U, D, but D obstacle, so U to (1,5) or R to (2,4) but reverse not allowed? Moved L to (1,4), direction L, next turn cannot move R.\n\nSo only U to (1,5) possible.\n\nThen at (1,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), I need to go down, but from (1,5), I can go to (1,4) but then stuck or something.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo probably, best to eat (4,5) early.\n\nThen from there, go to (6,4) as I thought.\n\nIn the sequence I had: turn 1 move R to (4,4), turn 2 move U to (4,5) eat, turn 3 move R to (5,5), turn 4 move R to (6,5), turn 5 move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (6,3), etc.\n\nNow, after that, I have food at (3,1) and (6,6), but (6,6) is dangerous.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), life 10, so on turn 6, it has 4 left? Turn 1: food life 10, each turn decreases, so turn 2:9, t3:8, t4:7, t5:6, t6:5, etc.\n\nOn turn 6, (3,1) has life 10 - 5 = 5 left? From turn 1 to turn 6, 5 turns passed? Turn 1 to turn 2 is one turn, so decreases by number of turns.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current when spawned, but in state, at turn 1, life span given, so on turn 1, it decreases to life-1? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut in input, at turn t1, life span is given, so on turn t1, it is present, and at end of turn, life decreases, I think.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn, food has life span, after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut for eating, during the turn, if head moves to it, it is eaten before disappearing.\n\nAssume that on each turn, before action, food life is as given, and after move, if eaten, removed, else life decreases by 1.\n\nIn the state, at turn 1, food has life span, so for example (3,1) life 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, so on turn 10 it is still there, turn 11 gone.\n\nSimilarly, life span N, disappears after N turns from now.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n\nAnd \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, countdown is C, after the turn, C decreases by 1, and when C=0, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t, C = life_span, after turn t, C = life_span - 1, and so on, until C=0, after the turn it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, if on turn t, head moves to food, it is eaten, and food removed.\n\nIf not eaten, after the turn, C decreases.\n\nSo for (3,1) at turn 1, life 10, so countdown 10, after turn 1, countdown 9, ..., after turn 10, countdown 0, disappears, so it is present from turn 1 to turn 10 inclusive? On turn 10, before move, countdown 1, if not eaten, after move it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nIf eaten on turn 10, it is consumed.\n\nSimilarly, for life span 10, it can be eaten on turns 1 to 10.\n\nIn this case, all food has high life, so no immediate risk.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) on turn 5, I am at (6,4) with body at (6,5), head direction D.\n\nThen turn 6, move D to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), tail removed, positions [(6,3), (6,4)] head D.\n\nThen turn 7, from (6,3) head D, I can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or R to (7,3) wall cannot, U to (6,4) but body, collision if I move U.\n\nMoved D to (6,3), direction D, so no instant reverse to U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R. R wall, so D or L.\n\nD to (6,2), or L to (5,3).\n\n(6,2) is free? y=2 row, no obstacles, so free.\n\n(5,3) is obstacle? (5,3) is obstacle, so cannot move L to (5,3).\n\nObstacles include (5,3), so (5,3) blocked.\n\nSo from (6,3), I can only move D to (6,2).\n\nMove to (6,2).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (6,2), move D to (6,1), or U to (6,3), or L to (5,2), or R wall.\n\nBut no instant reverse, moved D, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R. R wall, so D or L.\n\nD to (6,1), L to (5,2).\n\n(6,1) is free, (5,2) free.\n\nSay move D to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), etc.\n\nBut food at (3,1) is at (3,1), so I need to go left.\n\nFrom (6,2), I could move L to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc. to reach (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) has life 10, on turn 8, countdown 10 - 7 = 3? Turn 1: countdown 10, after turn 1:9, t2:8, ..., after turn 7:3, so on turn 8, countdown 3, still there.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (3,1).\n\nBut let's see the initial choice.\n\nI could go directly to (3,1) from start.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, from (3,4), move L to (2,4), then turn 2 move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4), but not down.\n\nTo go down, from (2,4), I cannot move D because obstacle, so I have to go to (2,5) or (1,4), then from there down.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move L to (2,4) head L.\n\nTurn 2 move U to (2,5) head U.\n\nTurn 3 move L to (1,5) head L? From (2,5), after moving U, direction U, then move L to (1,5), allowed, not opposite.\n\nAt (1,5), head L.\n\nThen turn 4, from (1,5), move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6) but (1,6) obstacle, or L wall, or R to (2,5) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (1,4).\n\nMove to (1,4), head D.\n\nThen turn 5, from (1,4), move D to (1,3) but (1,3) obstacle, cannot; L wall; R to (2,4); U to (1,5) reverse not allowed.\n\nMoved D to (1,4), direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed D, L, R. L wall, D to (1,3) obstacle, so only R to (2,4).\n\nMove to (2,4), head R? Direction to (2,4) from (1,4), moving R, so head R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,4), move U to (2,5), D to (2,3) obstacle, L to (1,4), R to (3,4), but no instant reverse, so cannot move L.\n\nAllowed U, D, R. D obstacle, so U or R.\n\nU to (2,5) or R to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is where we started, but no food.\n\nTo reach (3,1), I need to go down from (3,4) or other.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), but at turn 1 I didn't.\n\nIn this path, I am at (2,4) on turn 6, not near (3,1).\n\nSo it takes many turns to reach (3,1), and (4,5) might expire.\n\n(4,5) life 9, on turn 6, countdown 9-5=4, still there, but I am not near.\n\nWhereas in the first path, I ate two food by turn 5.\n\nSo better to go for (4,5) and (6,4).\n\nNow for (3,1), I can go after.\n\nBut in the first path, after turn 5, I am at (6,4), then to (6,3), (6,2), etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), then to (4,2), (3,2), then to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at y=1, x=3.\n\n(3,2) is free, I assume.\n\nThen from (3,2), move D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) is at y=1, which is bottom row.\n\nMoving to y=1 cells: similar to top, if I move D to (3,1), head direction D, then from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) obstacle, R to (4,1), but (2,1) obstacle, so only U or R.\n\nBut if I move D to (3,1), head D, then next turn I cannot move U because reverse.\n\nAnd D wall, L obstacle, R to (4,1), which is free.\n\nSo I can move R to (4,1).\n\nNot a dead end, since I can move right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is free, then I can go up.\n\nSo (3,1) is not a dead end like y=6.\n\nI can eat (3,1) by moving D to it, then next turn move R or L.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) move D to (3,1) eat, head D, then next turn move R to (4,1), etc.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), I ate by moving D to it, which is fine.\n\nBut for y=6, moving U to it is bad.\n\nSo in general, avoid moving to y=6 or y=1 with directions that trap, but y=1 I can escape.\n\nNow, back to turn 1.\n\nI think moving to eat (4,5) is good.\n\nBut at turn 1, I have three choices: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), then U to (4,5) eat on turn 2.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), then R to (4,5) eat on turn 2.\n\nIf I move L to (2,4), then I don't eat until later.\n\nSo moving U or R both allow eating on turn 2.\n\nMoving L delays.\n\nSince the grid is symmetric, but with obstacles, moving R might be better because after eating, I can go right to (5,5), etc. to reach (6,4).\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), then after eating at (4,5), I am at (4,5), and if I move L to (3,5), then I go left, which is away from (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is to the right.\n\nSo moving R on turn 1 might be better to position for (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is left, but I can go later.\n\nSo for turn 1, I should move R to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 2 move U to (4,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 3, from (4,5), I need to move L or R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), then turn 4 to (6,5), turn 5 to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (6,3).\n\nNow, from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) on turn 7.\n\nThen from (6,2), move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free, no obstacle.\n\nTo reach (3,1), I can go left.\n\nFor example, turn 8 from (6,2) move L to (5,2) head L.\n\nThen turn 9 move L to (4,2) head L.\n\nThen turn 10 move L to (3,2) head L.\n\nThen turn 11 move D to (3,1) eat.\n\n(3,1) life 10, on turn 11, countdown at turn 1:10, after turn 1:9, ..., after turn 10:0, so on turn 11, it is gone? After turn 10, countdown 0, disappears, so not available on turn 11.\n\nLife span: at turn t, countdown C.\n\nAfter each turn, C decreases by 1.\n\nWhen C=0 after the turn, it disappears.\n\nFor (3,1), turn 1: C=10\n\nAfter turn 1: C=9\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9: C=1\n\nAfter turn 10: C=0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 10, before move, C=1, I can eat it.\n\nIf not eaten, after move, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 10, I can eat (3,1) if I am there.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 11, it might be gone.\n\nTurn 1: C=10\n\nTurn 2: C=9 after turn 1\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: C=1 after turn 9, so on turn 10, C=1, I can eat.\n\nTurn 11: if not eaten, after turn 10, C=0, gone.\n\nSo to eat on turn 10.\n\nIn my path, on turn 10 I am at (3,2), and I can move to (3,1) on turn 10 to eat.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) eat, length 2\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4) eat, length 3\n\nTurn 6: move D to (6,3) no food, positions head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2) no food, head (6,2), body (6,3)\n\nTurn 8: from (6,2), move L to (5,2) head L\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,2) head L\n\nTurn 10: move L to (3,2) head L\n\nTurn 11: move D to (3,1) but on turn 11, (3,1) is gone if not eaten earlier.\n\nOn turn 10, at (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat on turn 10.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 10, move D to (3,1) eat.\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen next turn, I can move R to (4,1) or U to (3,2), but no reverse, moved D, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed D, L, R. D wall, L to (2,1) obstacle, so only R to (4,1).\n\nMove to (4,1), etc.\n\nAnd I ate three food.\n\n(6,6) I ignored because it's a trap.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,6)? Life 9, but I cannot eat it safely, so better to leave it.\n\nSimilarly, all food eaten except (6,6).\n\nNow for turn 1 action.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but I don't have to list all, just for the immediate turns, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term\", I should have a plan.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but probably for the next few turns, or until a decision point.\n\nSince the state might change, but for now, I can list a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the first 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list several.\n\nGiven that, for turn 1, I choose to move R.\n\nThen turn 2 U, turn 3 R, turn 4 R, turn 5 D.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U on turn 1 is similar.\n\nIf turn 1 move U to (3,5), turn 2 move R to (4,5) eat, same as before.\n\nThen turn 3, if I move R to (5,5), same as above.\n\nOr I could move L to (3,5), but that might not help for (6,4).\n\nBut (3,5) is same as after moving U.\n\nIn terms of position, after eating, same.\n\nSo both U or R on turn 1 lead to similar, but moving R directly might save a turn or something, no.\n\nIf move R to (4,4) turn 1, then U to (4,5) turn 2.\n\nIf move U to (3,5) turn 1, then R to (4,5) turn 2, same number of moves to eat.\n\nAnd position same after turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3 move R to (5,5) etc.\n\nSo either U or R on turn 1 is fine for eating (4,5).\n\nBut with moving R, I am at (4,4) which is right, so to go to (5,5) is natural.\n\nWith moving U, I am at (3,5), then moving R to (4,5) or to (5,5).\n\nBut after eating, I am at (4,5) in both cases.\n\nSo same.\n\nI can choose U or R.\n\nBut let's see the direction: head direction after turn 1.\n\nIf I move U, head U, then to (4,5) moving R, direction changes.\n\nBut not important.\n\nPerhaps moving R is better to avoid the left side obstacles, but no issue.\n\nAnother point: food at (3,1), but I can reach it later.\n\nSo for turn 1, I'll go with R.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nBut turn 5 D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen I can continue, but for the answer, list a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", list at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 1 to turn 5.\n\nThen in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut on turn 3, from (4,5) I move R to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nThe current state at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\):\n- Snake is a single segment at (3,4) with head direction Up.\n- Food locations: (6,4) value +1 (life 9), (4,5) value +1 (life 9), (6,6) value +1 (life 9), (3,1) value +1 (life 10).\n- Walls and obstacles: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n\nThe snake must maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, with a focus on long-term survival over 5+ turns. Key considerations:\n- **Immediate food targets**: (4,5) is the closest accessible food (2 moves away). Eating it on turn 2 grows the snake to length 2, enabling more efficient pathing.\n- **Dead ends**: Cells at y=6 (e.g., (4,6), (6,6)) are dead ends if entered from below due to movement constraints (no instant reverse and limited exits). Must avoid moving up to y=6 to prevent trapping.\n- **Path to other food**: After eating (4,5), head to (6,4) via (5,5) and (6,5). (6,4) can be eaten safely by moving down into it. (3,1) can be targeted later, but its life span (10) allows flexibility. (6,6) is unsafe to eat (entering from below traps the snake), so it should be avoided.\n- **Risk avoidance**: With no body initially, no collision risk. After growth, avoid moving into body segments. The grid has obstacles, so paths must be planned to avoid getting stuck (e.g., (5,4) obstacle blocks direct right from (4,4)).\n\n**5+ Turn Plan**:\n1. **Turn 1 (t=1)**: Move right (R) to (4,4). This positions the snake to eat (4,5) next turn and avoids the dead end at y=6. Moving up (U) is also possible but moving right aligns better with reaching (6,4) later.\n2. **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Move up (U) to (4,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 2 (positions: head (4,5), tail (4,4)).\n3. **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Move right (R) to (5,5). From (4,5), moving left (L) leads away from (6,4), and up (U) to (4,6) is a dead end (must be avoided).\n4. **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Move right (R) to (6,5). Only possible move from (5,5) due to obstacles and no instant reverse.\n5. **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move down (D) to (6,4) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 3. This is safe as (6,4) is not a dead end; exiting down is possible.\n6. **Beyond Turn 5**: Head to (3,1) for another food, e.g., via (6,3) → (6,2) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,1) on turn 10 (within life span). Avoid (6,6).\n\nThis plan eats two high-value foods by turn 5, growing the snake for better mobility, and sets up for (3,1) without risks. All actions prioritize open paths and avoid dead ends.\n\n### Answer\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: R (right)  \nTurn 2: U (up)  \nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: D (down)  \n}",

That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8 units wide and 8 high.\n\nCurrent turn is t=2.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment, [(4,4)]. That means the snake is just the head at (4,4), with no body. So length is 1.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,4,8,1) : position (6,4), life span 8, value +1 (since it's positive food, I assume, as value isn't specified but from context, it should be +1 unless stated otherwise. The food list says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the input, it's given as (x,y,life_span,value)? Let me check.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the list, it's written as (6,4,8,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value). I think there's a inconsistency in notation.\n\nLooking back: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6,4,8,1)\" and similarly for others. But in the description, it says \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\", so probably the order is (x,y, value, life_span) or what?\n\nIn the state input, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6,4,8,1)\" — this is ambiguous. But in the core rules, it's specified as ( (x,y), value, life_span ). So for (6,4,8,1), I think it's (x,y) = (6,4), value=8? That can't be right because food value should be +1 or -1.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the input format. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6,4,8,1)\"\n\nAnd in the core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nBut here it's listed as (6,4,8,1), which has four numbers. Probably, it's (x,y, life_span, value) or something. Let's see the values: all have 8 or 9, which are likely life spans, and 1 which is value.\n\nFor (6,4,8,1), I think it's x=6, y=4, life_span=8, value=1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5,8,1) : x=4,y=5, life_span=8, value=1\n\n(6,6,8,1) : x=6,y=6, life_span=8, value=1\n\n(3,1,9,1) : x=3,y=1, life_span=9, value=1\n\nAll have value=1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nValue=1 means +1, I assume.\n\nLife span: for first three, 8 turns, for last one, 9 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t=2, so food will disappear after N turns, including current, so life span decreases each turn.\n\nFor example, food at (6,4) has life_span=8, so it will disappear after 8 more turns, meaning at turn t=2+8=10? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present for turns t_current to t_current + N - 1? Let's think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t, and when it reaches 0, it disappears after that turn or at the end?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases on turn t, and when it becomes 0, it disappears at the end of turn t or before turn t+1.\n\nBut for simplicity, we can say that a food with life_span L at turn t will disappear at the start of turn t + L. But since countdown decreases including current turn, let's define.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t, life_span becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears after turn t.\n\nSo for food at (6,4) with life_span=8 at turn t=2, after turn 2, life_span=7; after turn 3, life_span=6; ... after turn 9, life_span=0, so it disappears at the start of turn 10 or after turn 9? I think it's safer to assume that it is available to be eaten during turns when life_span >0.\n\nAt turn t, if life_span >0, it can be eaten that turn.\n\nAfter being eaten or when life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=2, life_span=8, so it can be eaten on turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So grid is from x=1 to x=6? No.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. Similarly y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), so the border.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n\nSo these cells are also walls, cannot move there.\n\nNow, snake is at (4,4), head only, direction R.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite to R (right). Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1). Cannot move L.\n\nNow, let's list the grid.\n\nI'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but since borders are walls, the snake can only be on (1,1) to (6,6) I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. But x=0 and x=7 are walls, so snake can be on x=1,2,3,4,5,6. Similarly y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to x=6, that's 6 cells, but indices: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; similarly y=1,2,3,4,5,6. So 6x6 grid? But positions include (4,4), which is fine.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n(5,4) is an obstacle, but snake is at (4,4), so (5,4) is blocked.\n\nList of obstacle cells:\n\n- Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, or y=0, y=7.\n\n- Internal: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n(5,4) is internal obstacle, so snake cannot go there.\n\nFood at: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6), (3,1)\n\nAll with value +1.\n\nSnake at (4,4), direction R.\n\nNow, possible actions at turn t=2:\n\n- U: move to (4,5)\n\n- D: move to (4,3)\n\n- R: move to (5,4)\n\nBut (5,4) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot move R.\n\n- L: but cannot, instant reverse prohibited.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU: to (4,5) — there is food at (4,5)? Food positions include (4,5), yes.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut snake has no body, only head, so eating food will increase length to 2, with head at (4,5) and tail at (4,4)? When snake eats, it grows, so after eating, positions become [(4,5), (4,4)] or something.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves away; if food, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nHere, snake is length 1 at (4,4). If I move to a food cell, I eat it, so new head position, tail remains, so snake becomes length 2, with head at new position and tail at old position.\n\nIf I move to empty cell, snake moves, but since length 1, it just goes to new cell, no tail to move.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows to length 2: head at (4,5), tail at (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,3), which has no food, so snake moves to (4,3), still length 1.\n\nNow, (4,5) has food, so moving there I eat it.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) has life_span=8, so it can be eaten now.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves.\n\nAt (4,4), move U to (4,5): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (4,5), tail at (4,4)\n\nMove D to (4,3): no food, snake at (4,3), length 1.\n\nCannot move R to (5,4) because wall.\n\nCannot move L to (3,4) because instant reverse not allowed? Current direction is R, moving L would be opposite, so prohibited.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, after this turn, I need to plan for future turns.\n\nBut I have to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format is to output actions for turn t, t+1, t+2, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is for a sequence of actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should output at least 5 actions? But the game continues, so I need to decide based on state.\n\nSince the state changes after each action, I need to simulate or plan a path.\n\nBut for now, at turn t=2, I have to choose action.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nFirst, map the grid.\n\nLet me make a grid representation.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nFood: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6), (3,1)\n\nSnake: (4,4)\n\nPlayable cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 except the internal obstacles.\n\nList free cells.\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (3,6) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, (1,6) obstacle? (1,6) is internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles include (1,6), so (1,6) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: all x=1 to6 except? No internal obstacles at y=5, so all free except borders not included.\n\ny=4: x=1 to6, but (5,4) obstacle, so (5,4) blocked.\n\ny=3: x=1 to6, but (1,3) obstacle, (2,3) obstacle, (5,3) obstacle, so blocked cells: (1,3), (2,3), (5,3)\n\ny=2: all x=1 to6 free? Internal obstacles: (2,1) but y=1, not y=2. (2,1) is at y=1.\n\ny=1: x=1 to6, but (2,1) obstacle, and (3,1) has food, but not obstacle.\n\nFood is on free cells, I assume, but (3,1) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, other food cells.\n\nNow, back to turn t=2.\n\nOptions:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,5)\n\n- Eat food at (4,5), snake becomes length 2: positions [(4,5), (4,4)] head at (4,5), tail at (4,4)\n\n- Head direction: after moving U, new direction is U.\n\n- Food at (4,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\n- Other food still there.\n\nThen, at turn t=3, snake at (4,5) head, direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse: cannot move D (down), opposite to U.\n\nSo can move U (to (4,6)?), L (to (3,5)), R (to (5,5))\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(4,6): y=6, x=4, is it free? Internal obstacles: (3,6) and (5,6) are obstacles, but (4,6) is not listed, so should be free? Walls: y=6 is not border wall? y=7 is border, y=6 is inside.\n\nBorder walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, as long as not obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles at y=6: (3,6), (5,6), (1,6), so (4,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): x=3,y=5, no obstacles, free.\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5, no obstacles, free.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is tail, but when snake moves, tail moves, so at turn t=3, if I move, head moves to new position, and tail moves away from (4,4) to follow, but since snake is [(4,5), (4,4)], if head moves to (4,6), then tail moves to (4,5)? Let's think snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo for snake [head, body1, body2, ... tail]\n\nAfter move, new head position, body1 to old head, body2 to old body1, etc., tail moves away.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail is removed, so length same.\n\nIf food eaten, tail not removed, so new tail position added? Standard: when food eaten, after move, the tail does not move, so the cell where tail was remains, and head is at new position, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=2, after moving to (4,5) and eating, snake is [(4,5), (4,4)] with head at (4,5).\n\nNow at turn t=3, when I move, say to (4,6):\n\n- Head moves to (4,6), no food there (assuming), so snake moves: head to (4,6), body (which was head) to (4,5), but the tail was at (4,4), and since no food eaten, tail moves away, so it is removed, and new positions: head at (4,6), and the segment at (4,5) becomes body, so snake is [(4,6), (4,5)] with length 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten food at (4,6), but there is no food there.\n\nFood is at (6,4), (6,6), (3,1), (4,5) eaten.\n\n(6,6) is food.\n\nBut at (4,6), no food.\n\nSo after move to (4,6), snake [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow, back to turn t=3 options from (4,5) direction U.\n\nMove U to (4,6): as above.\n\nMove L to (3,5): (3,5) is free, no food.\n\nMove R to (5,5): (5,5) free, no food.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nNow, similarly, other options at t=2.\n\nBut I have another choice at t=2: move D to (4,3)\n\nThen, at (4,3), no food, snake still length 1 at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen at turn t=3, from (4,3) direction D, possible moves: L, R, D? Cannot move U, instant reverse prohibited.\n\nMove D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) is obstacle, internal wall, so cannot move R.\n\n(3,3): is it free? y=3, x=3, obstacles at y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), so (3,3) should be free? x=3,y=3, not listed, so free.\n\n(4,2): free, no obstacles.\n\nSo from (4,3) direction D, can move to (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3) but (5,3) wall, so only (4,2) or (3,3).\n\nNow, back to long-term planning.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nFood available: (6,4), (4,5), (6,6), (3,1)\n\n(4,5) is very close, at (4,5), which is adjacent up.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is two steps right, but (5,4) is wall, so I cannot go directly right to (6,4) because (5,4) is blocked.\n\nFrom (4,4), to reach (6,4), I need to go around.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) and (3,1) are farther.\n\nLife spans: all have life_span 8 or 9, at turn t=2.\n\n(6,4): life_span 8, disappears after turn 9? As I thought earlier, available until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5): life_span 8, available until turn 9.\n\n(6,6): life_span 8, until turn 9.\n\n(3,1): life_span 9, until turn 10.\n\nSince current turn 2, and life_span decreases each turn including current, so for (4,5) at turn 2, life_span=8, after turn 2 it becomes 7, so it can be eaten on turns 2 to 9, 8 turns.\n\nDisappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, if I eat (4,5) now at turn 2, I get +1, snake length 2.\n\nThen I need to plan where to go next.\n\nBut there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n\nBut in this case, after eating (4,5), tail is at (4,4), and head at (4,5), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nThe tail cell (4,4) has no food, food was eaten, so no issue.\n\nThe danger is if there is food on the tail cell and head moves to it after tail moves or something.\n\nBut here no food on tail.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nList all walls and obstacles to find a path.\n\nPlayable grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nObstacles:\n\n- y=1: cells (2,1) obstacle, others free except (3,1) has food.\n\n(3,1) is free, with food.\n\n- y=2: all free, no obstacles listed. Internal obstacles: (2,1) at y=1, not y=2. So y=2: all x=1,2,3,4,5,6 free.\n\n- y=3: obstacles at (1,3), (2,3), (5,3), so free cells: (3,3), (4,3), (6,3)\n\n- y=4: obstacles at (5,4), so free cells: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (6,4) but (4,4) snake, (6,4) food.\n\n(5,4) wall, so free: x=1,2,3,4,6 for y=4.\n\n- y=5: no obstacles, all free: x=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n- y=6: obstacles at (1,6), (3,6), (5,6), so free cells: (2,6), (4,6), (6,6) but (6,6) food.\n\n(2,6) free, (4,6) free, (6,6) food.\n\nFood at (6,4), (6,6), (3,1)\n\n(4,5) is to be eaten if I go there.\n\nNow, snake at (4,4).\n\nIf I move U to (4,5), eat food, score +1, snake length 2, positions [(4,5), (4,4)], head direction U.\n\nThen at turn t=3, I need to move.\n\nFrom (4,5), direction U, can go U to (4,6), L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\n(4,6): free, no food.\n\n(3,5): free, no food.\n\n(5,5): free, no food.\n\nIf I go to (4,6), then snake to [(4,6), (4,5)], head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nThen from there, at turn t=4, can go U, but y=6, U would be y=7, which is wall, so cannot go U.\n\nCan go L to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\nCan go R to (5,6), (5,6) obstacle.\n\nCan go D to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body, and moving there would cause collision.\n\nPositions: head at (4,6), body at (4,5). If I move D to (4,5), head touches body, collision, die.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: only L and R, but L to (3,6) wall, R to (5,6) wall, U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5) body collision. So no possible moves! Dead end.\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which is top row, but not border wall, but surrounded.\n\nx=4,y=6, neighbors: U (4,7) y=7 wall, D (4,5) which is body if snake is there, but in this case, when at (4,6), body is at (4,5), so (4,5) is occupied.\n\nL (3,6) obstacle, R (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo indeed, from (4,6), no safe move, death.\n\nTherefore, going to (4,6) is bad.\n\nFrom (4,5), I should not go to (4,6).\n\nInstead, from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nSay go L to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn t=3, move to (3,5), no food, snake moves: head to (3,5), tail moves from (4,4) to (4,5)? Snake positions: before move, [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nHead to (3,5), no food, so tail moves away: the segment at (4,4) moves to where? When head moves to new cell, the body segment (which was head) moves to the old head position? Standard: the body segment takes the position of the previous segment.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), head at (3,5), the body segment that was at (4,5) stays, but since tail was at (4,4), and no food, the tail moves off, so positions: head (3,5), and the only body segment at (4,5), so snake [(3,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength 2, head at (3,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at turn t=4, from (3,5) direction L, possible moves: U, D, L? Cannot move R, instant reverse prohibited.\n\nMove L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4)\n\n(2,5): is it free? y=5, x=2, no obstacles, free.\n\n(3,6): but (3,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\n(3,4): y=4, x=3, free? y=4, obstacles only (5,4), so (3,4) free.\n\nBut (3,4) is empty now, no food.\n\nSo can move to (2,5) or (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if from (4,5) I go R to (5,5) at t=3.\n\n(5,5) free, no food, snake to [(5,5), (4,5)] head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen at turn t=4, from (5,5) direction R, can move U, D, R? Cannot move L.\n\nMove R to (6,5), U to (5,6), but (5,6) obstacle, D to (5,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only R to (6,5) or D but D to (5,4) wall, U to (5,6) wall, so only R to (6,5) if possible.\n\n(6,5) is free? y=5, x=6, no obstacles, free.\n\nSo move to (6,5), no food, snake to [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut let's go back to t=2 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (4,5) at t=2, I eat and grow, but then from there, I need to avoid (4,6) as it's dead end.\n\nSo from (4,5), I should go to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is better because it's closer to other food, like (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is below (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go down to (6,4) to eat food.\n\nBut (6,4) has food.\n\nLife span is 8, at turn 2, so still time.\n\nNow, another option at t=2: move D to (4,3) instead of U.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3) at t=2, no food, snake at (4,3), length 1, direction D.\n\nThen at turn t=3, from (4,3) direction D, can move D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3) but (5,3) wall, so only (4,2) or (3,3).\n\nSay move to (4,2), no food, snake to (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, can go to (4,1), (3,2), (5,2), etc., but (4,1) has no food, (3,1) has food but not directly adjacent.\n\n(4,2) to (3,1) is diagonal, not adjacent, so need to move to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut (3,1) food can be reached.\n\nHowever, moving down might not be efficient for eating (4,5) which is closer.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is up, and if I don't eat it soon, I might miss it if life span low, but life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about the map.\n\nNotice that the upper part has many obstacles, especially at y=6, only (2,6), (4,6), (6,6) free, but (4,6) is a dead end as we saw, (2,6) and (6,6) are food positions? (6,6) is food, (2,6) is free but no food listed.\n\nFood at (6,6), so (2,6) is empty.\n\nBut from (4,6), it's trapped.\n\nSimilarly, lower part has (3,1) food.\n\nAlso, (6,4) food.\n\nNow, to reach (6,4) from (4,4), since (5,4) is wall, I need to go around, e.g., via (4,5) or (4,3) then to (5,5) or (5,3) but (5,3) wall, so via up or down.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\n(3,1) is at bottom left.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, since snake is short, I can eat food, but need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nIn the case where I go to (4,5) and then to (4,6), I die immediately, so I must avoid that.\n\nSo at t=2, if I move U to (4,5), I should not go to (4,6) later.\n\nBut I can choose to go left or right from (4,5).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (4,5). If I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later, but since no other snake, I can eat it anytime before it disappears.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might be better to grow and have more flexibility, but with risk of collision when longer.\n\nHere length 1, no risk.\n\nBut after eating, length 2, risk increases.\n\nAlso, the \"tail reward danger\" but not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no body, so all food is accessible.\n\nNow, let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn t=2, I have to choose between U and D.\n\nIf I choose U to (4,5), eat food, score +1, snake at [(4,5),(4,4)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=3, I must choose to go L or R, not U to (4,6).\n\nSay I go R to (5,5), no food, snake moves to [(5,5),(4,5)] head at (5,5) dir R.\n\nAt t=4, from (5,5) dir R, can only move R to (6,5) since U and D blocked or dangerous? U to (5,6) wall, D to (5,4) wall, so only R to (6,5).\n\nMove to (6,5), no food, snake to [(6,5),(5,5)] head at (6,5) dir R.\n\nAt t=5, from (6,5) dir R, can move U, D, R? But R to (7,5) x=7 wall, so cannot. U to (6,6), which has food, D to (6,4), which has food.\n\nCannot move L, instant reverse prohibited.\n\nSo can move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nIf move to (6,6), eat food, since food there, so grow, snake head to (6,6), tail stays, so positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), tail (5,5)? After eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nBefore move: snake [(6,5),(5,5)] head (6,5)\n\nMove to (6,6), which has food, so eat, head to (6,6), body segments: the previous head (6,5) becomes body, and tail (5,5) remains, so snake [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,4), eat, snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] or something.\n\nBut (6,4) and (6,6) both have food.\n\nLife span: both have life_span 8 at t=2, so at t=5, life_span decreased by 3, so 5 left, still available.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at corner, after eating, head at (6,6), then possible moves: from (6,6), direction U (since moved up? From (6,5) to (6,6) is U, so dir U.\n\nThen neighbors: U to (6,7) y=7 wall, D to (6,5) body, L to (5,6) obstacle, R to (7,6) wall. So no safe moves, death.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,4) from (6,5), move D to (6,4), eat food, head at (6,4), dir D.\n\nThen neighbors: U to (6,5) body, D to (6,3), L to (5,4) obstacle, R to (7,4) wall.\n\n(6,3): is it free? y=3, x=6, obstacles at y=3: (1,3),(2,3),(5,3), so (6,3) free? x=6,y=3, not listed obstacle, so free.\n\nSo can move D to (6,3).\n\nU to (6,5) body collision, L to (5,4) wall, R to (7,4) wall, so only D to (6,3).\n\nMove to (6,3), no food, snake moves: head to (6,3), body (6,4) to (6,4)? Positions before move: after eating (6,4), snake is [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), body (6,5) moves to old head (6,4)? The segment that was at (6,5) moves to the position of the head, which is now (6,4), and tail (5,5) moves to (6,5)? Let's clarify.\n\nSnake segments: index 0: head at (6,4), index 1: body at (6,5), index 2: tail at (5,5)\n\nAfter moving head to new position (6,3), no food eaten, so the tail is removed, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new head at (6,3), segment 1 moves to old head position (6,4), segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (6,5), but since no food, tail is removed, so only two segments: head at (6,3), and body at (6,4). Tail at (5,5) is gone.\n\nSo snake [(6,3), (6,4)]\n\nThen head at (6,3), dir D.\n\nThen can move, etc.\n\nBut back to the choice.\n\nIn the path where I go to (6,6) from (6,5), I die immediately because trapped.\n\nSo I should not go to (6,6) when at (6,5); instead go to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, in the earlier step, from (4,5) I went to (5,5) then to (6,5).\n\nBut at (6,5), I can go down to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen after eating (6,4), I go to (6,3) as above.\n\nNow, what about the food at (3,1)? It has longer life span, 9, so can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's see the other choice at t=2: moving D to (4,3).\n\nIf at t=2 move D to (4,3), no eat, snake at (4,3) dir D.\n\nThen t=3, from (4,3) dir D, can move to (4,2) or (3,3) (since R to (5,3) wall).\n\nSay move to (4,2), no food, snake to (4,2) dir D.\n\nThen t=4, from (4,2) dir D, can move D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,1): y=1, x=4, free? y=1, obstacle (2,1), so (4,1) free, no food.\n\n(3,2): free, no food.\n\n(5,2): free, no food.\n\nSay move to (3,2), then snake to (3,2) dir L (since moved left? From (4,2) to (3,2) is L, so dir L.\n\nThen t=5, from (3,2) dir L, can move U, D, L? Cannot move R.\n\nMove L to (2,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1) which has food.\n\n(3,1) has food, so if move to (3,1), eat, grow.\n\nBut (3,1) is at bottom, after eating, head at (3,1), then possible moves: from (3,1) dir D? If moved from (3,2) to (3,1) is D, so dir D.\n\nNeighbors: U to (3,2) body, D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) obstacle, R to (4,1) free.\n\nSo only R to (4,1) possible.\n\nThen move to (4,1), no food, snake moves, etc.\n\nBut I can eat (3,1) at t=5.\n\nIn the first path, I can eat (4,5) and (6,4) or something.\n\nBut let's compare scores.\n\nIf I move U at t=2, eat (4,5) at t=2, score +1.\n\nThen go to (5,5) at t=3, no eat.\n\nTo (6,5) at t=4, no eat.\n\nThen to (6,4) at t=5, eat, score +1, total +2.\n\nSnake length 2 or 3? After t=2, length 2; after t=5, eat (6,4), length 3.\n\nThen from (6,4), after eating, head at (6,4), dir D (since moved down from (6,5)? At t=5, from (6,5) move D to (6,4), so dir D.\n\nThen only move D to (6,3) as U, L, R blocked.\n\nMove to (6,3) at t=6, no eat, snake to [(6,3), (6,4)] head at (6,3) dir D.\n\nThen from (6,3) dir D, can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3) but (5,3) wall, R to (7,3) wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) free, move to (6,2), no food, snake to (6,2) dir D.\n\nThen to (6,1), but (6,1) is free, y=1, x=6, no obstacle.\n\nMove to (6,1), no food, snake to (6,1) dir D.\n\nThen from (6,1), neighbors: U to (6,2) body if present, but let's see positions.\n\nAt (6,1), dir D, but y=1, D to (6,0) wall, U to (6,2), which may be body, L to (5,1), R to (7,1) wall.\n\n(5,1): y=1,x=5, free? No obstacle, free.\n\nSo can move L to (5,1).\n\nBut not food.\n\nNow, the food at (3,1) is still there, life_span 9 at t=2, at t=6, life_span decreased by 4, so 5 left, still available.\n\nBut I am at (6,1), need to go to (3,1), which is left, but path may be blocked.\n\ny=1, obstacles: (2,1) wall, so from (6,1) to (3,1), I can go via (5,1), (4,1), but (3,1) is adjacent to (4,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path where I go down first, I can eat (3,1) sooner.\n\nFor example, at t=2 move D to (4,3), no eat.\n\nt=3 move to (4,2), no eat.\n\nt=4 move to (3,2), no eat? Or to (4,1) etc.\n\nt=3 from (4,3) move to (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nSay move to (3,3) at t=3.\n\n(3,3) free, no food, snake to (3,3) dir L (moved left from (4,3)).\n\nThen t=4 from (3,3) dir L, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3) but (2,3) obstacle, so only U or D.\n\nMove D to (3,2), no food, snake to (3,2) dir D.\n\nThen t=5 from (3,2) dir D, can move D to (3,1) which has food, eat, score +1.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2, head at (3,1), body at (3,2).\n\nDir D.\n\nThen only move R to (4,1) as U to (3,2) body, D wall, L to (2,1) obstacle.\n\nMove to (4,1) at t=6, no food, snake to [(4,1), (3,1)] or something.\n\nBut in this case, I ate only one food so far.\n\nWhereas in the first path, I ate two.\n\nBut in first path, after eating (6,4), I am at (6,3), etc., and can go to eat (3,1) if possible.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), I am at (6,3), need to go left and down, but y=1 has obstacles at (2,1), but I can go to (5,1), (4,1), then to (3,1) from (4,1) or (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is adjacent to (3,2), (4,1), (2,1) but (2,1) wall, so from (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) may be occupied or not.\n\nSince snake is short, possible.\n\nBut life span of (3,1) is longer, 9, so at turn 10 it disappears, so I have time.\n\nNow, back to t=2 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (4,5), I can eat it immediately and have a chance to eat (6,4) or (6,6), but (6,6) is risky as it causes death.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can only eat (6,4), not (6,6).\n\nAnd after eating (6,4), I am at (6,4) then (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go left instead of right.\n\nAt t=2 move U to (4,5), eat.\n\nt=3 move L to (3,5), no eat, snake to [(3,5), (4,5)] head at (3,5) dir L.\n\nt=4 from (3,5) dir L, can move U, D, L? Cannot move R.\n\nMove L to (2,5), U to (3,6) wall, D to (3,4)\n\n(2,5) free, (3,4) free.\n\nSay move to (2,5), no food, snake to [(2,5), (3,5)] head at (2,5) dir L.\n\nThen t=5 from (2,5) dir L, can move L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4)\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, free? Internal obstacles (1,6) and (1,3), but (1,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(2,6): free, no food.\n\n(2,4): free, no food.\n\nEtc. Not directly towards food.\n\nTo reach (6,4), it's far.\n\nSo the right path seems better to reach (6,4).\n\nNow, what about the food at (4,5)? If I don't eat it at t=2, I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, at t=2, move D to (4,3), then I can come back to eat (4,5) later.\n\nBut (4,5) life span 8, so at turn 10 it disappears, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut moving down first might delay eating.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can be flexible.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating (4,5) now is easy and safe, as long as I don't go to (4,6).\n\nThen I can go to (5,5) and then to (6,5), then to (6,4) to eat.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), I am at (6,4) with body, and I can go down to (6,3), then to (6,2), (6,1), then left to (5,1), etc., to reach (3,1).\n\nFood at (3,1) can be eaten later.\n\n(6,6) is also there, but it's a trap, as we saw, so better to avoid or eat only if safe, but from (6,5), going to (6,6) is death, so I should not eat it when adjacent to walls.\n\nSimilarly, if I can approach it from another way, but it's at corner with obstacles.\n\n(6,6) neighbors: U (6,7) wall, D (6,5), L (5,6) obstacle, R (7,6) wall. So only accessible from (6,5), but after eating, trapped, so it's a dangerous food, better not to eat unless necessary, but since it's positive, if I can eat and have escape, but here no escape, so I should avoid eating (6,6) to prevent death.\n\nSimilarly for other corner foods with no exits.\n\nSo in this case, (6,6) should be skipped.\n\nFood at (3,1) is also at corner, but let's see.\n\n(3,1) neighbors: U (3,2), D (3,0) wall, L (2,1) obstacle, R (4,1).\n\nSo accessible from (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nAfter eating, if head at (3,1), I can only move to (4,1) or (3,2), depending on direction.\n\nIf I move from (3,2) to (3,1), dir D, then from (3,1) I can move R to (4,1), as U to (3,2) body.\n\nSo not trapped, I can escape to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, if from (4,1) to (3,1), dir L, then from (3,1) I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), but R is reverse if dir L, but after moving, new direction.\n\nSo (3,1) is safer than (6,6).\n\n(6,6) has no safe exit after eating.\n\nTherefore, I should plan to eat (4,5), (6,4), and (3,1), but avoid (6,6).\n\nNow, for (4,5), I can eat it at t=2.\n\nThen go to (5,5) at t=3, to (6,5) at t=4, to (6,4) at t=5 to eat.\n\nThen at t=6, from (6,4) move D to (6,3), no eat.\n\nt=7, to (6,2), no eat.\n\nt=8, to (6,1), no eat.\n\nt=9, from (6,1) move L to (5,1), no food.\n\nt=10, from (5,1) move L to (4,1), no food.\n\nt=11, from (4,1) move L to (3,1)? But (3,1) has food, and life_span.\n\nAt turn t=2, (3,1) life_span=9, so available until turn 10? Disappears at turn 11 or something.\n\nLife_span=9 at t=2, after t=2, life_span=8, after t=3,7, ..., after t=10, life_span=0, disappears, so can be eaten on turns 2 to 10.\n\nAt turn t=11, it disappears.\n\nSo at t=11, if I move to (3,1), it may not be there, but at t=10, I can eat it if I reach.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=10, I am at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) to eat if available.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, move left.\n\nAt t=10, life_span of (3,1): at t=2, life_span=9, decreases each turn, at turn t, life_span = initial - (t - t_initial) but t_initial is t=2.\n\nAt turn t, for food present at turn 2, life_span decreases by (t - 2) at start of turn or end?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we process, countdown decreases.\n\nAt turn t=2, countdown is 9, after decrease, 8, so available.\n\nAt turn t=3, countdown 8, decrease to 7, available.\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=10, countdown 1, decrease to 0, then it disappears after being checked or something? But typically, if life_span >0 at start of turn, it can be eaten that turn.\n\nAfter eaten or life_span=0, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t=10, for (3,1), initial life_span=9 at t=2, so at start of t=10, life_span = 9 - (10-2) +1? Let's calculate remaining turns.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=10, 9 turns? Turns: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: that's 9 turns.\n\nAt t=2, life_span=9, after t=2, it becomes 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including the current? Confusion.\n\nBetter to think the countdown value.\n\nAt turn t, food has countdown C.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, if C>0, it is present.\n\nDuring the turn, it can be eaten.\n\nAfter the turn, C decreases by 1.\n\nIf C was 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (3,1) at t=2: C=9, present at t=2.\n\nAfter t=2, C=8.\n\nAt t=3, C=8, present, after t=3, C=7.\n\n...\n\nAt t=10, C=1 (since decreased from 9 by 8 times? t=2 to t=9: after t=9, C=9-8=1? Start t=2, C=9.\n\nAfter t=2, C=8.\n\nAfter t=3, C=7.\n\nAfter t=4, C=6.\n\nAfter t=5, C=5.\n\nAfter t=6, C=4.\n\nAfter t=7, C=3.\n\nAfter t=8, C=2.\n\nAfter t=9, C=1.\n\nAfter t=10, C=0, disappears.\n\nAt turn t=10, C=1 at start, so present, can be eaten.\n\nAfter t=10, C=0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, not present.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=10, I am at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) is present at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,5), at t=2 C=8, at t=10 C=8 - (10-2) = 8-8=0, but:\n\n(4,5) at t=2: C=8\n\nAfter t=2, C=7\n\n...\n\nAfter t=9, C=0, disappears, so at t=10 not present.\n\nBut I eat it at t=2, so no issue.\n\nNow in the plan, with move U at t=2, I eat (4,5) at t=2, then (6,4) at t=5, and (3,1) at t=10 if I reach.\n\nAt t=10, I can eat (3,1).\n\nBut in the path, from t=6 to t=9 I am moving down and left, not eating, but that's fine.\n\nI could eat more, but only three food, and (6,6) is dangerous.\n\nNow, if at t=2 I move D to (4,3), I might eat (3,1) earlier but miss (4,5) or eat later.\n\nFor example, at t=2 move D to (4,3)\n\nt=3 move to (3,3) or (4,2)\n\nSay t=3 move to (3,3) dir L\n\nt=4 move to (3,2) dir D (from (3,3) to (3,2) is D)\n\nt=5 move to (3,1) eat, score +1 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=6 move to (4,1) dir R? From (3,1) to (4,1) is R, so dir R.\n\nThen from (4,1) can go U to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut to eat (4,5), I need to go up.\n\nAt t=6 from (4,1) move U to (4,2), no food\n\nt=7 to (4,3), no food? But (4,3) may be free.\n\nThen t=8 to (4,4), no food\n\nt=9 to (4,5), but (4,5) at t=9, C for (4,5): at t=2 C=8, after t=8, C=0? After t=2 C=7, t=3 C=6, ..., after t=8 C=8-7=1? After t=8, C=8-7=1? Start t=2 C=8.\n\nAfter t=2, C=7\n\nAfter t=3, C=6\n\nAfter t=4, C=5\n\nAfter t=5, C=4\n\nAfter t=6, C=3\n\nAfter t=7, C=2\n\nAfter t=8, C=1\n\nAfter t=9, C=0, gone.\n\nAt turn t=9, C=1, present, can be eaten.\n\nSo at t=9, move to (4,5) from (4,4), eat.\n\nBut snake length: after eating (3,1) at t=5, length 2, then moving, at t=9 eat (4,5), length 3.\n\nAlso (6,4) can be eaten, but need to go right.\n\nFrom (4,5) at t=9, then I can go to (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) at t=12 or something, but (6,4) at t=12: C=8 at t=2, after t=11 C=0? After t=11 C=8-10=-2? Disappears after t=9, since C=1 at t=9, after eaten or not, after t=9 C=0 gone.\n\nAt t=10 not present.\n\nSo I can only eat two food: (3,1) and (4,5), missing (6,4).\n\nWhereas if I go up first, I can eat (4,5), (6,4), and (3,1).\n\nSo better to go up at t=2.\n\nTherefore, I think moving U at t=2 is better.\n\nThen the sequence: t=2: U to (4,5) eat.\n\nt=3: R to (5,5) no eat\n\nt=4: R to (6,5) no eat\n\nt=5: D to (6,4) eat\n\nThen t=6: D to (6,3) no eat (only choice)\n\nt=7: D to (6,2) no eat\n\nt=8: D to (6,1) no eat\n\nt=9: L to (5,1) no eat? From (6,1) to (5,1) is L, so dir L.\n\nt=10: L to (4,1) no eat\n\nt=11: L to (3,1)? But (3,1) at t=11 not present, as disappears after t=10.\n\nAt t=10, (3,1) present, but I am at (5,1) at t=9 end? Let's list positions.\n\nAfter t=5: snake after eating (6,4): positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? Earlier: at t=5 move from (6,5) to (6,4) eat, so head to (6,4), body: previous head at (6,5) becomes body, tail at (5,5) remains, so [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nt=6: move D to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), body: the segment at (6,5) moves to (6,4), segment at (5,5) moves to (6,5), and since no food, tail is removed, so new positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), and the tail was (5,5) moves to (6,5), but since no food, it is not added, so snake has two segments: head (6,3) and body at (6,4). The (5,5) cell is vacated.\n\nSnake: [(6,3), (6,4)]\n\nt=7: move D to (6,2), no food, snake to [(6,2), (6,3)]\n\nt=8: move D to (6,1), no food, snake to [(6,1), (6,2)]\n\nt=9: from (6,1) dir D, can move L to (5,1), U to (6,2) body, D wall, R wall. So move L to (5,1), dir L.\n\nSnake to [(5,1), (6,1)]\n\nt=10: from (5,1) dir L, can move L to (4,1), U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall. But U to (5,2) is possible, but I want to go to (3,1).\n\nMove L to (4,1), no food, snake to [(4,1), (5,1)]\n\nt=11: from (4,1) dir L, can move L to (3,1), but (3,1) not present, or U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall.\n\n(3,1) disappeared at turn 11, so not there.\n\nAt t=10, (3,1) is present, but at t=10 I am at (4,1), and I can move to (3,1) only at t=11? At t=10, from (4,1), I can move to (3,1) if I choose.\n\nAt t=10, I am at (4,1) with direction L (from moving L to (4,1) at t=10? Let's see.\n\nAt t=9, I moved to (5,1), so at start t=10, snake at [(5,1), (6,1)]? Positions after t=9: after move to (5,1), snake [(5,1), (6,1)] head (5,1) dir L.\n\nAt t=10, from (5,1) dir L, possible moves: L to (4,1), U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall.\n\nI can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), no food, snake to [(4,1), (5,1)]\n\nThen at t=11, from (4,1) dir L, can move L to (3,1) but not present, or U to (4,2).\n\nBut (3,1) gone.\n\nIf at t=10 I move directly to (3,1) from (5,1)? (3,1) is not adjacent to (5,1), it's diagonal or two steps away.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can only move to adjacent cells: (4,1), (5,2), (5,0) invalid.\n\n(3,1) is at distance 2, so I need two moves to reach from (5,1).\n\nAt t=10, I can move to (4,1), then at t=11 to (3,1) but not present.\n\nAt t=10, (3,1) is present, but I am at (5,1), not adjacent, so I cannot eat it at t=10.\n\nTo eat at t=10, I need to be adjacent at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, I am at (5,1), not adjacent to (3,1).\n\nThe closest I can be is at (4,1) at t=10, but (4,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, so if I move to (4,1) at t=10, I can then at t=11 move to (3,1) but it disappeared.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the plan, to eat (3,1) at t=10, I need to be at (3,2) or (4,1) at t=10 and move to (3,1) at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, from where?\n\nIn the sequence, I am at (6,1) at t=8, then at t=9 move to (5,1), at t=10 at (5,1), not at (4,1).\n\nI can adjust the path.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4) at t=5, instead of going down, I can go left earlier.\n\nAt t=6, from (6,4) after eating, head at (6,4) dir D, but I can only move D to (6,3).\n\nThen t=7 from (6,3) dir D, move to (6,2)\n\nt=8 from (6,2) dir D, move to (6,1)\n\nBut at t=8, from (6,2) I can move L to (5,2) instead of D.\n\nFrom (6,2) dir D, can move L to (5,2), U to (6,3) body, D to (6,1), R invalid.\n\nSo move L to (5,2) at t=8.\n\nThen snake: after move, head to (5,2), body to (6,2) or something.\n\nBefore move: snake at [(6,2), (6,3)] head (6,2) dir D? After t=7: at t=7 moved to (6,2), so positions [(6,2), (6,3)] head (6,2) dir D.\n\nt=8: move L to (5,2), no food, so head to (5,2), body (6,3) moves to (6,2), tail removed, so snake [(5,2), (6,2)]\n\nHead at (5,2) dir L.\n\nt=9: from (5,2) dir L, can move L to (4,2), U to (5,3) but (5,3) obstacle, D to (5,1)\n\nSo move to (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nSay move to (4,2), no food, snake to [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2) dir L.\n\nt=10: from (4,2) dir L, can move L to (3,2), U to (4,3), D to (4,1)\n\n(3,2) free, (4,3) free, (4,1) free.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I can move to (3,2) or (4,1), but not directly.\n\nIf move to (3,2), then at t=11, from (3,2) can move D to (3,1) but not present.\n\nAt t=10, (3,1) present, but from (4,2) I can move to (4,1) or (3,2), not to (3,1).\n\nThen at t=10, if at (3,2), I can move to (3,1) at t=10 only if I am at (3,2) at t=10 and move D.\n\nBut at t=10, I am at (4,2), so I can move to (3,2) at t=10, then at t=11 to (3,1) not present.\n\nIf at t=9 I go to (5,1) instead.\n\nAt t=9 from (5,2) move D to (5,1), no food, snake to [(5,1), (5,2)] head (5,1) dir D.\n\nt=10 from (5,1) dir D, can move L to (4,1), U to (5,2) body, D wall.\n\nSo move L to (4,1), no food, snake to [(4,1), (5,1)]\n\nThen at t=11, from (4,1) can move to (3,1) not present or U to (4,2).\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,1) because I arrive too late.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to be there by turn 10.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4) at t=5, I can go directly left and down.\n\nAt t=6 from (6,4) move to (6,3) only.\n\nt=7 from (6,3) move to (6,2)\n\nt=8 from (6,2) move to (5,2)  -- as above, but at t=8.\n\nThen at t=9 from (5,2) move to (4,2) or (5,1)\n\nIf move to (4,2) at t=9, snake at [(4,2), (5,2)]\n\nt=10 from (4,2) move to (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3)\n\nIf move to (3,2), then I can move to (3,1) at t=10? From (4,2) to (3,2) at t=10, then not at (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,2) at t=10, I can move to (4,1) or (3,2), not to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,2) at t=10, I can move to (3,1) at t=11 but gone.\n\nIf at t=10 I am at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) at t=10 only if I move from (4,1) to (3,1), which requires being at (4,1) at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, I can be at (4,1) if I move directly.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=10, 5 moves.\n\nFrom (6,3) at t=6, to (6,2) t=7, to (6,1) t=8, to (5,1) t=9, to (4,1) t=10.\n\nAt t=10, at (4,1), move to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut at t=10, (3,1) present, so I can eat at t=10.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=6: from (6,3) move D to (6,2)  -- head at (6,3) after t=6 move? After t=5: head at (6,4) with body.\n\nAfter t=5: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] but when moving at t=6 to (6,3), no eat, so head to (6,3), body: (6,5) to (6,4), (5,5) to (6,5), tail removed, so snake [(6,3), (6,4)]\n\nt=7: move D to (6,2), no eat, snake to [(6,2), (6,3)]\n\nt=8: move D to (6,1), no eat, snake to [(6,1), (6,2)]\n\nt=9: move L to (5,1), no eat, snake to [(5,1), (6,1)]\n\nt=10: move L to (4,1), no eat, but (4,1) no food, snake to [(4,1), (5,1)]\n\nNow at t=10, from (4,1) dir L, can move L to (3,1), which has food, eat, so move to (3,1), eat, snake grows.\n\nThen head at (3,1), body at (4,1), tail at (5,1)? After move: head to (3,1), body: previous head at (4,1) becomes body, tail at (5,1) remains, so [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] length 3.\n\nAnd (3,1) eaten at t=10.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo in this case, I eat all three food: (4,5) at t=2, (6,4) at t=5, (3,1) at t=10.\n\n(6,6) not eaten, but it's dangerous, so fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I need to output from turn t=2 to some turns, but since the state changes, I should output the sequence for the immediate actions.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but it might be long.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I can output 5 actions or more.\n\nIn this plan, I have a sequence.\n\nAt t=2: U\n\nt=3: R\n\nt=4: R\n\nt=5: D\n\nThen t=6: D\n\nt=7: D\n\nt=8: D\n\nt=9: L\n\nt=10: L\n\nBut at t=10 I move L to (4,1) from (5,1), but to eat (3,1) at t=10, I need to move from (4,1) to (3,1) at t=10, but at t=10 I am moving to (4,1), so at t=11 I would move to (3,1) but not present.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=10 I move to (4,1), so I am at (4,1) at the end of t=10.\n\nThen at t=11, I can move to (3,1) but it's gone.\n\nBut to eat at t=10, I need to be on (3,1) at t=10.\n\nIn the move at t=10, from (5,1) I move to (4,1), not to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is not adjacent to (5,1), so I cannot move directly.\n\nIn the path I described earlier for eating (3,1) at t=10, I need to be at (4,1) at t=9 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions at the start of each turn.\n\nTurn t=2: start, snake at (4,4), dir R\n\nAction U: move to (4,5), eat, end t=2: snake [(4,5), (4,4)] head (4,5) dir U\n\nTurn t=3: start, snake [(4,5), (4,4)] head (4,5) dir U\n\nAction R: move to (5,5), no eat, end t=3: snake [(5,5), (4,5)] head (5,5) dir R\n\nTurn t=4: start, snake [(5,5), (4,5)] head (5,5) dir R\n\nAction R: move to (6,5), no eat, end t=4: snake [(6,5), (5,5)] head (6,5) dir R\n\nTurn t=5: start, snake [(6,5), (5,5)] head (6,5) dir R\n\nAction D: move to (6,4), eat, end t=5: snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head (6,4) dir D\n\nTurn t=6: start, snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head (6,4) dir D\n\nAction D: move to (6,3), no eat, end t=6: head to (6,3), body (6,5) to (6,4), (5,5) to (6,5), tail removed, so snake [(6,3), (6,4)]\n\nTurn t=7: start, snake [(6,3), (6,4)] head (6,3) dir D\n\nAction D: move to (6,2), no eat, end t=7: snake [(6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTurn t=8: start, snake [(6,2), (6,3)] head (6,2) dir D\n\nAction D: move to (6,1), no eat, end t=8: snake [(6,1), (6,2)]\n\nTurn t=9: start, snake [(6,1), (6,2)] head (6,1) dir D\n\nAction L: move to (5,1), no eat, end t=9: snake [(5,1), (6,1)] head (5,1) dir L\n\nTurn t=10: start, snake [(5,1), (6,1)] head (5,1) dir L\n\nAction L: move to (4,1), no eat, end t=10: snake [(4,1), (5,1)]\n\nAt this point, (3,1) is present at start of t=10, but I am at (5,1), not adjacent. After move to (4,1), at end t=10, snake at (4,1), and (3,1) disappears after t=10, so at t=11 not present.\n\nTo eat at t=10, I need to move to (3,1) during t=10.\n\nBut from (5,1), I cannot reach (3,1) in one move.\n\nThe only way is to be at (4,1) or (3,2) at start of t=10 and move to (3,1).\n\nFor example, if at t=9 I am at (4,1), then at t=10 move to (3,1).\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=9 I am at (6,1), moving to (5,1).\n\nTo be at (4,1) at t=9, I need to move left faster.\n\nFor example, after t=5, at t=6 move to (6,3)\n\nt=7 move to (6,2)\n\nt=8 move to (5,2) instead of (6,1)\n\nAt t=8: from (6,2) dir D, move L to (5,2), no eat, end t=8: snake [(5,2), (6,2)] head (5,2) dir L\n\nt=9: from (5,2) dir L, move L to (4,2), no eat, end t=9: snake [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2) dir L\n\nt=10: from (4,2) dir L, can move L to (3,2), U to (4,3), D to (4,1)\n\nNow, to eat (3,1), I can move to (4,1) or (3,2), but not directly to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,2) at end t=10, I can move to (3,1) at t=11 but gone.\n\nMove to (4,1) at t=10, then to (3,1) at t=11 gone.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (3,1) with this path because I spent too many moves going down.\n\nFrom (6,4) at t=5, I can go left immediately, but I have to go down first because of the direction.\n\nAt t=6, from (6,4) only down to (6,3).\n\nThen at t=7, from (6,3) I can move to (6,2) or, since dir D, I can move L to (5,3) but (5,3) obstacle, or R invalid, U to (6,4) body, so only D to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, only down until (6,1).\n\nSo I cannot go left earlier; I am stuck going down the column.\n\nTherefore, I might not be able to eat (3,1) in time with this approach.\n\nBut (3,1) has life_span 9, so I have more time, but in the down-first approach, I can eat it earlier.\n\nPerhaps for maximizing score, eating two food is fine, but I can eat three if I go to (3,1) first or something.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can choose to eat (3,1) first.\n\nAt t=2, move D to (4,3)\n\nt=3 move to (3,3)  -- from (4,3) move L to (3,3)\n\nt=4 move to (3,2)  -- from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n\nt=5 move to (3,1) eat\n\nThen at t=6 move to (4,1)  -- from (3,1) move R to (4,1)\n\nThen t=7 move U to (4,2)\n\nt=8 move U to (4,3)\n\nt=9 move U to (4,4)\n\nt=10 move U to (4,5) eat\n\nThen I have eaten (3,1) and (4,5), but not (6,4) which disappeared.\n\n(6,4) at t=10 not present.\n\nSo only two food.\n\nI can after eating (3,1), go to (6,4) but it's far and time short.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) at t=6, move to (4,2) t=7, to (4,3) t=8, to (4,4) t=9, to (5,5) t=10, to (6,5) t=11, but (6,4) gone at t=10.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is to eat two food, either (4,5) and (6,4) or (3,1) and (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) and (6,4) are both in the right area, so better to eat them.\n\nAnd (3,1) is out of way, so I can skip it for survival.\n\nWith the first plan, I eat two and survive.\n\nSo for the action sequence, I can output for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's provide the actions.\n\nAt turn t=2: U\n\nThen t=3: R\n\nt=4: R\n\nt=5: D\n\nThat's 4 actions, but think 5+ turns ahead, so perhaps add one more.\n\nAt t=6: D\n\nBut in the sequence, after t=5, at t=6 I move D to (6,3)\n\nSo for the answer, I can output from t=2 to t=6 or more.\n\nBut the format is to list the actions.\n\nSince the state changes, but for this response, I think providing the initial actions based on the plan.\n\nSo for turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\n etc.\n\nBut to be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple turns ahead, considering food locations, life spans, obstacles, and movement constraints. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 2\\)) has the snake at position (4,4) with direction R, and available food at (6,4), (4,5), (6,6), and (3,1), all with value +1 and varying life spans. The grid has border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), and (1,6).\n\n### Key Planning Insights:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 2)**: The snake can move U (to (4,5)) or D (to (4,3)), as moving R is blocked by a wall at (5,4) and moving L is an instant reverse (prohibited). Moving U to (4,5) eats the food immediately, increasing length to 2 and scoring +1. This is prioritized as (4,5) is adjacent and avoids missing it later, though it has a life span of 8 (available until turn 9).\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - Moving to (4,6) from (4,5) leads to a dead end (no safe moves due to walls and body collision), so it must be avoided.\n  - Food at (6,6) is dangerous—eating it traps the snake with no escape—so it should be skipped.\n  - Food at (6,4) is safe to eat if approached from above (e.g., from (6,5)), allowing an exit downward.\n  - Food at (3,1) has a longer life span (9, available until turn 10) but is less accessible; it can be eaten later if possible, but the path to it may be time-consuming with risks of missing it.\n- **Long-Term Path**: \n  - Eat (4,5) at turn 2, then move right toward (6,4) via (5,5) and (6,5) to eat it by turn 5.\n  - After eating (6,4), move down to (6,3), (6,2), and (6,1) to avoid dead ends and open paths for survival.\n  - (3,1) is not eaten in this sequence due to distance and life span constraints; focusing on closer food maximizes early score and survival.\n- **Sequence Safety**: All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. After growing, the snake can navigate safely with the planned path.\n\n### Action Sequence for Turns 2 to 6 (5+ turns ahead):\n- **Turn 2**: Move U to (4,5) — Eats food (+1 score), snake grows to length 2, new positions: [(4,5), (4,4)], head direction U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (5,5) — No food, snake moves to [(5,5), (4,5)], head direction R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move R to (6,5) — No food, snake moves to [(6,5), (5,5)], head direction R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (6,4) — Eats food (+1 score), snake grows to length 3, new positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], head direction D.\n- **Turn 6**: Move D to (6,3) — No food, snake moves to [(6,3), (6,4)], head direction D (only safe move; U, L, R blocked).\n\n### Explanation Beyond Turn 6:\n- **Turns 7-10**: Continue moving down to (6,2), (6,1), then left to (5,1), (4,1) for survival. (3,1) is skipped as it disappears after turn 10 and is not reachable in time without risking the snake. This path ensures the snake survives with a score of +2 from the two eaten food items.\n- **Why Not Eat (3,1)?** Reaching (3,1) by turn 10 requires a detour that misses (6,4) or risks late arrival. With life spans, (6,4) disappears after turn 9, so eating it at turn 5 is optimal. (3,1) is low-priority due to distance and lower net gain compared to the safer path.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating two high-value foods early and prioritizes survival by avoiding dangerous cells and dead ends. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms no better path exists for both score and longevity.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid, since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns 0 and 7 are walls, and rows 0 and 7 are walls. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are given as border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]. So I need to avoid these as well.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,5), and the body is at (4,4). Since there are only two segments, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is Up, meaning it's facing upwards, so last move was Up.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nSince the snake is short, eating food will make it longer, which might increase risk later, but I need to eat to grow and score.\n\nCurrent turn is t=3. I need to output actions starting from turn 3, but the state is given for turn 3, so action for turn 3 is what I decide now.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn t1: action\n\nTurn t1+1: action\n\n...\n\n}\n\nAnd t1=3, so I need to specify actions for turn 3, turn 4, turn 5, etc. How many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be a sequence. I think I need to provide a sequence of actions for the next few turns, at least 5 actions or so.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but doesn't specify how many to output. In the answer format, it has \"Turn t1: action\", \"Turn t1+1: action\", etc., but no end specified. I think I should provide a sequence for, say, 5 turns to demonstrate the thinking.\n\nBut since the state might change after each action, I need to simulate based on the actions I choose.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 3, life spans are as given, then at turn 4, they decrease by 1, and so on.\n\nLet me list the food with their positions and remaining life:\n\nAt turn 3:\n\n- Food at (6,4): life 7, value +1\n\n- Food at (6,6): life 7, value +1\n\n- Food at (3,1): life 8, value +1\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), body at (4,4), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so I cannot instantly reverse to Down on the next turn. So for turn 3, I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n(5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, so row 5 has obstacles.\n\nSnake head at (4,5), which is row 4, column 5? Coordinates: (x,y), so (4,5) is x=4, y=5.\n\nDirection Up, so moving in increasing y-direction? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as we go up, I assume.\n\nStandard: U (x, y+1) means up, so higher y is up.\n\nD (x, y-1) down, lower y.\n\nL (x-1, y) left\n\nR (x+1, y) right\n\nWalls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Since U is y+1, if y=7 is top wall, then y=7 cannot be moved to.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nNow, snake at (4,5) head, (4,4) body.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,6)\n\n- D: to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, but it's the tail. Since the snake moves, when I move, the tail will also move, so moving to (4,4) might be possible if it's the tail.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to the tail cell is safe because after the move, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, body is only one segment, the tail at (4,4). So if I move Down to (4,4), it should be safe because after moving, the head is at (4,4), and the tail was at (4,4) but moves to where? When the head moves, the body follows.\n\nStandard snake movement: if head moves to a new cell, and if it doesn't eat, the tail moves off the last position, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a cell:\n\n- If the cell has food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\n- If no food, tail moves, so the previous tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut for collision: moving into a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because when you move onto it, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (4,5), moving Down to (4,4) is onto the tail. Since it's the tail, after move, head is at (4,4), and tail was at (4,4) but since we moved, the tail should move to... wait no.\n\nSequence: head moves to new position. If that position was occupied by tail, and since it's the only body segment, after head moves to (4,4), the tail segment (which was at (4,4)) needs to move, but it can't stay, so the snake effectively doesn't grow, and the tail position is updated.\n\nTypically, in snake games, when head moves to the tail cell, it doesn't collide because the tail moves away at the same time. So it's safe.\n\nSimilarly here, rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (4,4) is allowed and safe.\n\nAlso, if I move to (4,4) and there is food there, but in this case, no food at (4,4), so it would be just moving, no growth.\n\nBut let's see possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: to (4,6)\n\n- D: to (4,4) - tail, safe\n\n- L: to (3,5)\n\n- R: to (5,5)\n\nNow, check for walls and obstacles.\n\nFirst, (4,6): is it wall or obstacle? y=6 is not border, border is y=7 and y=0. y=6 is within 1 to 6? Playable y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n\n(4,6): x=4, y=6, which is within bounds. Obstacles: look at list, (3,6) is obstacle, (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nObstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n(4,6) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): is it obstacle? No, not listed.\n\n(3,5): x=3,y=5, not border, not in obstacles list.\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5, not border. Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), but (5,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,3) and (5,4) are obstacles, but (5,5) is fine.\n\nSo all four directions are possible in terms of movement, but since direction is Up, I cannot move Down instantly, but Down is to (4,4), which is tail, and it's allowed to move to tail, but the no instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move Down on this turn.\n\nTherefore, for turn 3, possible actions: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting food and avoiding risks.\n\nFood at (6,4), (6,6), (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is far, at x=3,y=1, head at (4,5), so quite a distance.\n\n(6,4) and (6,6) are closer, both at x=6.\n\ny=4 and y=6.\n\nHead at (4,5), so to reach (6,4) or (6,6), I need to go right and then down or up.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have high life, 7 and 8 turns, so no immediate expiration.\n\nBut I should plan a path to eat one of them.\n\nSince snake is short, eating food will make it longer, which might block paths later.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival, so maybe avoid eating if it causes immediate danger, but here no danger yet.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards the food.\n\nOption 1: Move Right towards (6,4) or (6,6)\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move R to (5,5), then I can go to (6,5), but (6,5) is not food, food is at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is below, (6,6) is above.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is obstacle, and (5,3), (5,4) obstacles.\n\n(5,3), (5,4) obstacles, so from (5,5), I cannot go down to (5,4) or (5,3), but I can go to (6,5), or up to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go up.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, so from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) but obstacle, not possible; D to (5,4) obstacle, not possible; L to (4,5); R to (6,5).\n\nSo only L and R, but R to (6,5) is possible.\n\n(6,5) is within bounds? x=6, y=5, x=6 not wall, since walls x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable? x from 1 to 6, I think.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable? x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, meaning you cannot be at x=0 or x=7.\n\nPlayable x: 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly y:1 to 6.\n\n(6,5): x=6,y=5, should be playable, not obstacle.\n\nObstacles: none at (6,5), so free.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go to (6,4) or (6,6), both food.\n\n(6,4) and (6,6) are food.\n\nBut (6,6) might be risky because of obstacles.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here tail at (4,4), no food on it.\n\nNow, back to turn 3.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,5), only moves possible: since (5,6) obstacle, (5,4) obstacle, so I can only move L or R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5).\n\nThen at (6,5), I can then move to food.\n\nBut (6,4) and (6,6) are both food, so I can choose.\n\nBut let's see the grid around.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (1,6), (2,1), etc., but not near here.\n\nAnother food at (3,1), which is left and down.\n\nNow, if I move L from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(3,6) obstacle, so from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) obstacle, not possible; D to (3,4); L to (2,5); R to (4,5) but that's where I came from, but it's not body yet? Snake positions after move.\n\nAfter turn 3, if I move L to (3,5), then head at (3,5), body at (4,5), since tail was (4,4), but when head moves to (3,5), no food eaten, so tail moves from (4,4) to... wait.\n\nAt start of turn 3, snake: head (4,5), body (4,4)\n\nAfter action, say move L to (3,5), then new head position (3,5), and since no food eaten, tail moves off (4,4), so new snake positions: head (3,5), body (4,5) — the segment that was at (4,5) is now the body.\n\nSo body at (4,5), and tail gone? Length 2, so after move, positions: [(3,5), (4,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (4,6), snake becomes [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nIf move R to (5,5), [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nIf I could move D, but cannot.\n\nNow, back to moving L to (3,5): from (3,5), as above, cannot go U to (3,6) obstacle, so possible moves: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but (4,5) is now body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), body is at (4,5), so (4,5) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,5) now, but when moving, if I try to move to (4,5), it is the tail? Let's see.\n\nAfter head is at (3,5), the segments are: head (3,5), and body (4,5). (4,5) is the only body segment, so it is the tail.\n\nIf I move back to (4,5), it is the tail cell, so it should be safe, because tail will move away.\n\nRule: you can move into tail cell.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (3,4) free, I think\n\n- L: (2,5) free\n\n- R: (4,5) tail, safe\n\n(3,4): is it free? x=3,y=4, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), etc., no (3,4), so free.\n\n(2,5): similarly free.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can go D, L, or R (to tail).\n\nBut going R back to (4,5) might not be progress.\n\nSimilarly, moving U from (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free, as established.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot; D to (4,5) which might be body or tail; L to (3,6) obstacle; R to (5,6) obstacle.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), snake: head (4,6), body (4,5)\n\nThen moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) which is body, but it's the tail? Positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), so (4,5) is tail.\n\nIf move D to (4,5), it is tail cell, so safe.\n\n- L: (3,6) obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (5,6) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D back to (4,5), which is tail.\n\nBut then I'm stuck, because from there, I can only go back or something.\n\nFrom (4,6), only move is down to (4,5), which is safe, but then I'm back to similar position.\n\nNot good for long term.\n\nTherefore, moving U on turn 3 might lead to a dead end or limited options.\n\nSimilarly, moving D is not possible because of reverse rule.\n\nSo best options are L or R.\n\nNow, moving R to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), as before, only moves L or R, since U and D blocked by obstacles.\n\nU (5,6) obstacle, D (5,4) obstacle.\n\nSo move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\n(4,5) might be body, but after moving to (5,5), snake is [(5,5), (4,5)], so (4,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), it is tail, safe.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), then I'm at (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go to food.\n\n(6,5) to (6,4) or (6,6), both possible and both have food.\n\n(6,4) is down, (6,6) up.\n\nAlso, (6,4) and (6,6) are food, so I can eat one.\n\nBut let's think about after eating.\n\nIf I go to (6,4), for example.\n\nFirst, sequence.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat food.\n\nWhen I move to (6,4), it has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n\nThen positions: head at (6,4), body at (6,5), tail at (5,5)? After move to (6,4) with eat, so head moves to (6,4), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so body segments: the previous head was at (6,5), now body, and (5,5) still body, so snake: head (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nPositions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, not tail, so collision if I move there.\n\n(6,5) is the second segment, not tail, tail is at (5,5).\n\nSo moving U to (6,5) would be collision with body.\n\nD to (6,3): is it valid? y=3, within 1-6, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (5,4) but (5,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), and so on.\n\nBut (6,3) might be ok, but the food at (6,6) is still there, but I didn't eat it.\n\nIf from (6,5) I go to (6,6) instead.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6) to eat food.\n\nThen head at (6,6), with food eaten, so snake grows: positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision; L to (5,6) obstacle; R to (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo no possible moves! Stuck and die.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (6,6) and eat, I die immediately because no escape.\n\nBut (6,6) has an obstacle at (5,6) and walls around.\n\nSpecifically, from (6,6), surrounded: up wall, down body, left obstacle, right wall. Only down is (6,5) but it's occupied by body, so indeed no move, death.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat (6,6) if I can, or avoid going there when snake is longer.\n\nIn this case, from (6,5), moving to (6,6) is fatal.\n\nMoving to (6,4) is possible, to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go D to (6,2), etc., but there might be other food.\n\nNow, back to the other food at (3,1).\n\nIf I move L from (4,5) to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) tail.\n\nSay I go D to (3,4) on turn 4.\n\nThen snake: after turn 3 move L to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 4 move D to (3,4), no food, so tail moves, snake [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,1) which has food.\n\n(3,1) is at y=1.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, tail? Positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), so (3,5) is tail.\n\nIf move U to (3,5), tail, safe.\n\nD to (3,3); L to (2,4); R to (4,4) etc.\n\n(3,3) free, I assume.\n\nThen to reach (3,1), I need to go down.\n\nBut there are obstacles: (2,1) and (1,3), (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,1) is food, and obstacles at (2,1), which is adjacent? (2,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) might be reachable.\n\nPath to (3,1): from (3,4) go D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then D to (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,2) and (3,3) should be free, no obstacles listed.\n\nObstacles: (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free.\n\nSo possible.\n\nLife span of (3,1) is 8 at turn 3, so it will disappear after 8 turns, but I can reach it in a few moves.\n\nBut let's compare to going right.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the tail reward danger, but no issue yet.\n\nAnother thing: if I eat food, snake grows, so it might block paths.\n\nBut currently short.\n\nAlso, since all food is positive, eating is good, but need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nIn the right path, if I eat (6,4), I go to (6,3), then I can go down or left, but left to (5,3) is obstacle, so only down to (6,2), etc., and the grid has obstacles, might be limited space.\n\nLet's list all obstacles to see the free space.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo row y=1: obstacles (2,1), so (1,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) should be free, but (2,1) blocked.\n\ny=2: (2,3) obstacle, so (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) but (2,2) might be free? (2,3) obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (5,3) obstacles, so (3,3), (4,3), (6,3) free.\n\ny=4: (5,4) obstacle, so (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (6,4) free? (6,4) is food, not obstacle.\n\nFood is separate.\n\ny=5: no obstacles listed, so all free except borders.\n\ny=6: (3,6), (5,6), (1,6) obstacles, so (2,6), (4,6), (6,6) free? (4,6) and (6,6) are free, but (6,6) is food.\n\n(2,6) not listed, should be free.\n\nx from 1 to 6.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I go right and eat (6,4), I end up at (6,4) with snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], then must go D to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go D to (6,2), or L to (5,3) but (5,3) obstacle, so only D or U, but U to (6,4) is body, not accessible.\n\nFrom (6,3), moves: U to (6,4) body, collision; D to (6,2); L to (5,3) obstacle; R to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nThen to (6,1), etc., but at bottom, might be ok, but the food at (3,1) is there, and I can go left from there, but it might take time.\n\nLife span: (6,4) life 7, if I eat on turn 5, it's fine.\n\n(3,1) life 8, will be there for 8 turns from turn 3, so until turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life 7, but if I don't eat it, it disappears later.\n\nBut eating (6,6) is dangerous as we saw.\n\nNow, if I go left towards (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,5) move L to (3,5) turn 3.\n\nThen say move D to (3,4) turn 4.\n\nThen move D to (3,3) turn 5.\n\nThen move D to (3,2) turn 6.\n\nThen move D to (3,1) turn 7 to eat.\n\nOn turn 7, life span of (3,1) is 8 at turn 3, so at turn 7, life span decreases to 8-4=4? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 3, life span 8, meaning it will disappear after N turns, so at turn 3+8=11 it disappears, but can be eaten on turn 10? Countdown decreases every turn.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span L, it has L turns left including current, so after L turns it disappears, meaning on turn t + L it is gone, so can be eaten up to turn t + L - 1.\n\nExample: at turn t, life_span L, then at turn t, countdown L, after turn t, countdown L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until countdown 0 at turn t+L, it disappears.\n\nSo can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n\nHere at turn 3, (3,1) life_span 8, so can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 3+7=10? Turn t to t+L-1.\n\nTurn 3: countdown 8, after turn, countdown 7 for turn 4.\n\nAt turn k, countdown = initial L - (k - t)\n\nFor (3,1), t=3, L=8, so at turn k, countdown = 8 - (k - 3)\n\nEaten if head on cell when countdown >=1, i.e., before turn t + L.\n\nDisappears after N turns, so on turn t + N it is gone.\n\nSo can be eaten on turns from t to t + N - 1.\n\nHere t=3, N=8, so can be eaten turn 3 to 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) and (6,6) L=7, t=3, can be eaten turn 3 to 9.\n\nIn my left path, I eat on turn 7, which is fine.\n\nBut during this, I'm not eating other food.\n\n(6,4) and (6,6) might expire if not eaten.\n\nBut I can choose to go for closer food.\n\nAnother option: from (4,5), I could go down, but I cannot because of reverse rule, direction up.\n\nUnless I do multiple moves.\n\nBut for turn 3, I have to choose U, L, or R.\n\nU is not good, as we saw.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail reward danger for future, but not now.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat immediately to keep snake short for maneuverability.\n\nBut I need to score.\n\nSince (6,6) is dangerous to eat, better to eat (6,4) or (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is farther.\n\n(6,4) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (6,4) is distance |4-6| + |5-4| = 2+1=3 moves if I go directly, but with obstacles, I need to go through (5,5) and (6,5) or something.\n\nShortest path: from (4,5) to (6,4), I can go R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then D to (6,4), three moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,1): from (4,5) to (3,1), |4-3| + |5-1| =1+4=5 moves down and left, but since I can move directly down from (3,5), etc.\n\nBut with the snake, when I move, the body follows.\n\nIn the right path, if I eat on turn 5, snake grows to length 3.\n\nThen I go to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut at (6,3), I have only one move to (6,2), then to (6,1), then I can go left to (5,1), but (5,1) is free? y=1, x=5, not obstacle, and not border, so free.\n\nThen to (4,1), etc., towards (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is food, and I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, in left path, I go directly to (3,1).\n\nBut in left path, I don't eat (6,4), which might expire.\n\nBut life span long, it can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nAnother food at (6,6), but we saw it's dangerous, so better to avoid or eat only if possible.\n\nBut from (6,5), if I go to (6,6), I die, so I should not.\n\nUnless the snake is shorter, but even with length 2, if I go to (6,6) from (6,5), when I eat, I grow to length 3, but then no move, die.\n\nWith length 2: head at (6,5), body at (5,5), if I move to (6,6) to eat, head to (6,6), body to (6,5), tail stays? When eat, no tail move, so positions [(6,6), (6,5)], and (5,5) is vacated? No.\n\nAt turn, say, head at (6,5), body (5,5), move U to (6,6), which has food, so head moves to (6,6), food eaten, so tail does not move, so new segment added, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), and the previous body (5,5) remains, so length 3: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (6,6), as before, no moves, die.\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,6) without dying immediately, because it's surrounded.\n\nTherefore, (6,6) is a trap; I should not attempt to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nSo only viable foods are (6,4) and (3,1).\n\nNow, (3,1) has longer life span, 8 vs 7.\n\nBut (6,4) is closer.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,4), I can go down and left to (3,1).\n\nDistance from (6,4) to (3,1) is |6-3| + |4-1| =3+3=6 moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) to (3,1) is 5 moves.\n\nBut with snake growth, etc.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,4) first since it's closer and might be riskier to leave it, but no immediate risk.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,4) might be eaten, then I can go to (3,1).\n\nBut let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 3, I think moving R is better to go towards (6,4).\n\nSo turn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,5), move R to (6,5)  (since only choice, or I can move L, but that would be back)\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\nMoving L back might not be progress, so move R to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat food.\n\nNow, after eating, snake: head (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nDirection: I moved D to (6,4), so head direction down.\n\nNow, as before, only possible move is D to (6,3)\n\nSo turn 6: move D to (6,3)\n\nNow snake: no food, so tail moves, positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), body (6,5)? After move to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), body from (6,4) and (6,5), but tail at (5,5) moves off, so new positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), and the previous body (6,5) becomes the new tail? Segments: after turn 5, snake was [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (6,4), body segments at (6,5) and (5,5)\n\nWhen move to (6,3) no food, so head moves to (6,3), the body follows: the segment at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo when head moves from (6,4) to (6,3), the first body segment at (6,5) moves to (6,4), and the tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), body (6,5)\n\nTail at (6,5)\n\nNow from (6,3), moves: U to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, not tail; (6,4) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is at (6,5).\n\nSo moving U to (6,4) would collide with body.\n\nD to (6,2)\n\nL to (5,3) obstacle\n\nR to (7,3) wall\n\nSo only D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2)\n\nThen snake: head (6,2), body (6,3), body (6,4), tail at (6,4)? After move: head to (6,2), body from (6,3) to (6,2)? Positions: previous head (6,3), body (6,4), body (6,5)\n\nMove head to (6,2), no food, so body moves: segment at (6,4) moves to (6,3), segment at (6,5) moves to (6,4), tail was at (6,5), moves to (6,4)? New positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nFrom (6,2), moves: U to (6,3) body, collision if not tail; (6,3) is body, not tail, tail is at (6,4).\n\nSo U to (6,3) invalid.\n\nD to (6,1)\n\nL to (5,2)\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\nSo possible D to (6,1) or L to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is free? y=2, x=5, not obstacle, free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) free.\n\nNow, I can go towards (3,1).\n\nSay turn 8: move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I go L to (5,2), then from there, I can go to (4,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nTo (3,1), I need to go down from (3,2) or something.\n\n(3,1) is at y=1.\n\nFrom (6,2), if I move D to (6,1) turn 7, then from (6,1), I can move L to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (3,1) before it expires.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at (6,2) or (6,1), and (3,1) can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (3,1) is |6-3| + |2-1| =3+1=4 moves, say L to (5,2), L to (4,2), L to (3,2), D to (3,1).\n\n4 moves, so on turn 11, but turn 10 is last to eat, so if I start from turn 7, I can reach by turn 10 or 11.\n\nTurn 7: at (6,2)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (3,1)\n\nBut on turn 11, (3,1) disappears? At turn 3, life span 8, disappears after 8 turns, so on turn 11 it is gone, cannot eat on turn 11.\n\nCan eat up to turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: if I am at (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat on turn 10.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (3,1) on turn 10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to be at (3,2) on turn 10.\n\nFrom turn 7 at (6,2), to (3,2) in 3 moves: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) on turn 8,9,10.\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut on turn 10, I move to (3,1), which has food, so eat.\n\nNow, what about the left path directly to (3,1).\n\nIf on turn 3 move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4 move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5 move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 7 move D to (3,1) eat.\n\nOn turn 7, I eat (3,1), earlier.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to other areas.\n\nBut the food at (6,4) might still be there, I can go right.\n\n(6,4) can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,4) is |3-6| + |1-4| =3+3=6 moves, so by turn 13, but turn 9 is last, too late.\n\nTurn 7 at (3,1), to (6,4) in 6 moves, arrive turn 13, but (6,4) gone by turn 10 (since turn 3+7=10 disappear), can eat up to turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is last, from turn 7, I can reach in 2 moves? No, too far.\n\nSo if I eat (3,1) first, I miss (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (6,4) first, I can eat (3,1) later as above.\n\nIn the first approach, I eat (6,4) on turn 5, and (3,1) on turn 10.\n\nBoth eaten.\n\nIn the left approach, I eat (3,1) on turn 7, but miss (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is not eatable.\n\nSo better to eat (6,4) first, then go to (3,1).\n\nMoreover, in the sequence, after eating (6,4), I go down to (6,3), (6,2), etc., which is on the way to (3,1) sort of.\n\nNow, for turn 3, I should move R.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, need to think about the tail reward danger, but no food on tail now.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,4) to eat, the head is not adjacent to tail, tail is at (5,5), not adjacent to (6,4), so no issue.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,5), move R to (6,5)  (only sensible, or I could move L, but not)\n\nTurn 5: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat\n\nNow, after this, for turn 6, I have to move D to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (6,3), move D to (6,2)  (since only choice)\n\nFrom (6,3), only D to (6,2), as before.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2)\n\nNow from (6,2), I have choices: I can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2)\n\nI need to go towards (3,1), so moving left is better.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (3,1) to eat, but on turn 11, (3,1) is gone? At turn 10, if I move to (3,1), but turn 10 is the last possible turn to eat (3,1).\n\n(3,1) can be eaten up to turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, I need to be on (3,1) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: I am at (3,2), and I move to (3,1).\n\nIf I move on turn 10 to (3,1), and it has food, I eat it.\n\nBut at turn 10, countdown: initial life span 8 at turn 3, after 7 turns, at turn 10, countdown = 8 - (10-3) = 8-7=1, so on turn 10, countdown 1, I can eat it, then it decreases to 0 and disappears after turn.\n\nSo yes, on turn 10 move to (3,1) and eat.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), eaten on turn 5, countdown at turn 3 is 7, on turn 5, countdown 7-2=5, still there.\n\nNow, in turn 7, I am at (6,2), move L to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nBut on turn 7, from (6,2), I could move D to (6,1) first, but that might delay going left.\n\nBetter to go left directly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D  (to (6,2)? Turn 6: to (6,3), turn 7: to (6,2))\n\nAfter turn 6: head at (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2)\n\nThen from (6,2), turn 8: move L to (5,2)\n\nBut I need to specify for 5+ turns, say up to turn 8 or so.\n\nThe answer should have a sequence starting from turn 3.\n\nAlso, for turn 7, at (6,2), I move to (6,1) or (5,2). I think (5,2) is better to go left.\n\n(6,1) is bottom, might be dead end later.\n\nBut with obstacles, (2,1) obstacle, so y=1 row has (1,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) free, (2,1) blocked.\n\nSo I can go to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut moving directly left from (6,2) to (5,2) is fine.\n\nThen to (4,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nNow, after turn 10, I eat (3,1), but I don't need to specify that far, since the sequence might change based on state.\n\nBut for the output, I think I should provide a sequence for about 5 turns.\n\nSince think 5 turns ahead, output actions for turn 3 to turn 7 or 8.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4)  // eat food\n\nTurn 6: move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2)\n\nNow at turn 7, I am at (6,2), and I can choose to move L or D.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can stop here or add one more.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps output up to turn 7.\n\nBut turn 7 action is D to (6,2), then for turn 8, I would move L to (5,2), but not necessary to output.\n\nTo demonstrate thinking, output 5 actions: turn 3 to turn 7.\n\nBut turn 3 to turn 7 is 5 actions.\n\nt1=3, so turn 3,4,5,6,7.\n\nYes.\n\nIn turn 7, I move D to (6,2), but from (6,2), moving D to (6,1) might not be necessary, I can move L directly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, turn 7 is D to (6,2)? Turn 6: to (6,3), turn 7: from (6,3) move D to (6,2)\n\nThen at (6,2), for turn 8, I can move L.\n\nBut for the output, I think turn 3 to 7 is fine.\n\nI could from (6,2) move L on turn 7, but turn 7 action is from (6,3) to (6,2) with D.\n\nAfter turn 6, head at (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: possible moves: D to (6,2) or, as before, only D, since U to body, L obstacle, R wall.\n\nEarlier I said only D to (6,2)\n\nFrom (6,3), moves:\n\nU: (6,4) - but after turn 6, snake positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), body (6,5) as I thought earlier? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 5: head at (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (6,3), no food.\n\nHead moves to (6,3), body segments: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,4)? Positions: previous: head (6,4), body A at (6,5), body B at (5,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (6,3), body A moves to where head was, (6,4), body B moves to where body A was, (6,5).\n\nSo new: head (6,3), body (6,4), body (6,5)\n\nTail at (6,5)\n\nNow from (6,3), moves:\n\n- U to (6,4): (6,4) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (6,5), so (6,4) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to it causes collision.\n\n- D to (6,2): free\n\n- L to (5,3): but (5,3) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- R to (7,3): wall, invalid\n\nSo only D to (6,2)\n\nSimilarly, after move to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), body (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\nThen from (6,2), moves:\n\n- U to (6,3): (6,3) is body, not tail (tail at (6,4)), collision\n\n- D to (6,1): free\n\n- L to (5,2): free\n\n- R to (7,2): wall, invalid\n\nSo I can choose D or L.\n\nFor long-term, I should go L to (5,2) to go towards (3,1).\n\nSo in the sequence, for turn 8, I would move L.\n\nBut since I output up to turn 7, it's fine.\n\nNow, about the other food, but I think this is ok.\n\nTo have a complete plan, but I think for the answer, I can output actions for turn 3 to 7.\n\nBut in turn 7 action, it is D to (6,2), which is necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can start by moving left, but I think moving right to eat (6,4) is better because it's closer.\n\nIf I move left first, I might not get (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is eaten earlier, which is good for score.\n\nScore is per food eaten, so eating sooner is better, I think, but survival is priority, but here no issue.\n\nIn terms of risk, after eating, snake is longer, might be more risk, but here the grid has space.\n\nSo I think R first is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAlso, need to specify the actions.\n\nSo for turn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nBut turn 7 D to (6,2), then I need to go left later.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 7 is from (6,3) to (6,2), D.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can include turn 8.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (5,5) on turn 3, and (6,5) on turn 4, is there any risk?\n\n(5,5) has no obstacles, and (6,5) is free.\n\nFood at (6,6) is above, but I don't go there.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 3):**\n- **Snake**: Head at (4,5), body at (4,4), length 2, direction Up.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)].\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,4): Value +1, life span 7 (can be eaten until turn 9).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 7 (can be eaten until turn 9), but eating it is fatal due to surrounding walls/obstacles (no escape after growth).\n  - (3,1): Value +1, life span 8 (can be eaten until turn 10).\n- **Constraints**: Current direction is Up, so Down is not allowed on turn 3 (no instant reverse). Must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and body segments (except tail).\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Food at (6,6) is a trap**: If eaten, the snake grows to length 3 and has no valid moves (surrounded by walls and obstacles), causing immediate death. Must avoid.\n- **Viable food targets**: \n  - (6,4): Closer (3 moves away) and safe to eat if approached from above (avoiding tail-reward danger, which doesn't apply here). Eating it scores +1 and increases length to 3.\n  - (3,1): Farther (5 moves away) but has longer life span. Can be targeted after (6,4) to maximize score.\n- **Movement limitations**:\n  - After eating (6,4), the snake must move down to (6,3) due to limited space (left and up blocked, right is wall).\n  - Path to (3,1) from (6,4) is feasible via the bottom row (y=1 and y=2), avoiding obstacles.\n- **Long-term survival focus**: \n  - Eat (6,4) first for immediate score while keeping the snake short for maneuverability.\n  - Then navigate to (3,1) to eat before turn 10, using the bottom-left path for safety.\n  - Avoid (6,6) entirely.\n- **5+ Turn Simulation**:\n  - **Turn 3**: Move Right (R) to (5,5) – progresses toward (6,4) while avoiding reverse.\n  - **Turn 4**: Move Right (R) to (6,5) – positions for eating (6,4). Only valid moves are Left/Right from (5,5) (up/down blocked by obstacles).\n  - **Turn 5**: Move Down (D) to (6,4) – eat food (+1 score, length 3). Snake now at [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)].\n  - **Turn 6**: Move Down (D) to (6,3) – only safe move (up to body, left obstacle, right wall). Snake now at [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)].\n  - **Turn 7**: Move Down (D) to (6,2) – only safe move initially, then prepare to go left toward (3,1). Snake now at [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)].\n  - **Beyond (for context, not in output)**: \n    - Turn 8: Move Left (L) to (5,2) to start path to (3,1).\n    - Turn 9: Move Left (L) to (4,2).\n    - Turn 10: Move Left (L) to (3,2), then Down (D) to (3,1) to eat on turn 10 (within life span).\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Prioritizes survival**: Avoids (6,6) trap and uses open paths. After eating (6,4), the down moves are forced but safe, leading to the bottom row where obstacles are sparse.\n- **Maximizes score**: Eats two positive foods: (6,4) on turn 5 and (3,1) on turn 10.\n- **Efficient path**: (6,4) is eaten quickly (turn 5), and (3,1) is reached just in time (turn 10) with minimal risk. No negative food present.\n- **Risk mitigation**: Short snake length initially allows flexibility. After growth, path to (3,1) avoids body collisions and obstacles.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 3-7):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 6: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 7: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are given: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), and one body segment at (4,5). So the snake is length 2. Head direction is R, which is right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,4) with life_span 6, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,6) with life_span 6, value +1\n\n- (3,1) with life_span 7, value +1\n\n- (2,5) with life_span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive here; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life_span decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is 4, so for food at (6,4), life_span 6 means it will disappear after 6 turns from now? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so after 6 turns, it vanishes. Similarly for others.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nList them:\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (1,6)\n\nSnake: head at (5,5), body at (4,5). So currently, the snake occupies (5,5) and (4,5).\n\nHead direction is R, so it just moved right to (5,5) from (4,5)? Positions are given as [(5,5), (4,5)], so head is first, so at turn 4, head is at (5,5), and it was at (4,5) before. Since direction is R, it moved right from (4,5) to (5,5).\n\nNow, possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left. Possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are available to move to from (5,5):\n\n- Up (U): (5,6) — but (5,6) is an internal obstacle? From the list: (5,6) is an obstacle, so I can't move there.\n\nInternal obstacles include (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\n- Down (D): (5,4) — (5,4) is also in the obstacle list? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are all obstacles. (5,4) is an obstacle, so blocked.\n\n- Right (R): (6,5) — is this blocked? (6,5) is not in obstacle list, and not border? Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,5) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=5 between 0 and 7. Not an internal obstacle, so should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: obstacles are (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6). So (6,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nBut (5,4) is obstacle, so down is blocked. (5,6) obstacle, up blocked. Left is opposite, not allowed. So only possible move is right to (6,5)?\n\nThat seems restrictive. Let me double-check.\n\nCurrent position: (5,5)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,5+1) = (5,6) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- D: (5,5-1) = (5,4) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- L: (5-1,5) = (4,5) — but (4,5) is the body segment. But in snake movement, moving to the tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so it's not a collision. Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, for food, it says food can be under body, but only eaten when head moves there after body moves away.\n\nBut here, (4,5) is the current tail. If I move left to (4,5), since the tail will move, it might be safe, but let's see the movement.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its position, so if I move head to where tail was, it should be fine because tail leaves that cell.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head (5,5), body (4,5). If I move left to (4,5), then new head position is (4,5), and since the tail was at (4,5), but when head moves to (4,5), the body segments follow.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAt turn 4, snake: positions [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter move, for turn 5:\n\n- If I move left to (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied by the tail. When I move head to (4,5), the tail will move away? No.\n\nThe movement: the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (4,5), which is where the tail currently is, then the new positions: head at (4,5), and the body segment that was at (4,5) moves to... but there was only one body segment, at (4,5). After head moves to (4,5), the body moves to where head was, (5,5). So new positions: head (4,5), body (5,5). But (5,5) was head, now body.\n\nIn terms of grid, cell (4,5) had the tail, now it has the head, and (5,5) has the body.\n\nBut initially, before move, cell (4,5) had tail, and (5,5) had head.\n\nAfter moving head left to (4,5), the head is now at (4,5), and the body (which was at (4,5)) moves to the previous head position (5,5). So now snake is at [(4,5), (5,5)].\n\nSo the tail moved from (4,5) to (5,5), and head is at (4,5).\n\nNow, is there a collision? Head at (4,5) and body at (5,5), no issue. Also, since the tail moved away, no self-collision.\n\nMoreover, if there was food at (4,5), it could be eaten, but here there is no food mentioned at (4,5).\n\nBack to possible moves.\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- U: (5,6) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- D: (5,4) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- L: (4,5) — currently occupied by tail, but moving there is allowed, as per rule.\n\n- R: (6,5) — free cell.\n\nSo possible actions: L or R.\n\nBut head direction is R, and moving L is opposite, so is it allowed? The no instant reverse rule: \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so moving left would be opposite, so not allowed.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is R to (6,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to reach (5,5) from (4,5) at previous turn.\n\nNow, for the next move, I cannot move opposite, so cannot move left.\n\nUp and down are blocked by obstacles.\n\nRight is free.\n\nSo only possible action is R to (6,5).\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(5,5): up (5,6) — y=6, which is not border? y=7 is border, so y=6 is within bounds. But (5,6) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSimilarly, down (5,4) — internal obstacle.\n\nLeft (4,5) — not wall, but occupied by tail, but moving there is possible, but direction: moving left is opposite to current direction R, so prohibited by no instant reverse.\n\nRight (6,5) — x=6, y=5, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is R to (6,5).\n\nSo for turn 4, action must be R.\n\nBut the answer is for multiple turns, starting from turn t1=4.\n\nThe output should be actions for turn 4, turn 5, etc., up to at least 5 turns ahead? The user said \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and the answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nBut in the current state, for turn 4, I have only one choice: R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan.\n\nFirst, let's execute turn 4 action.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nNew snake positions: head moves to (6,5), body moves to previous head position (5,5). So snake: [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead direction now R (since moved right).\n\nFood: all food still there, but life_span decreases by one for each? Life_span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nCurrent turn is 4, so after turn 4, life_span decreases for all food.\n\nFood at (6,4) life_span 6, after turn 4, it becomes 5.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life_span 6 to 5, (3,1) 7 to 6, (2,5) 10 to 9.\n\nNow, turn 5: head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse: current direction R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- U: (6,6) — is it free? (6,6) has food? But let's see if it's accessible.\n\n(6,6) is a cell, not border, not in obstacle list. Obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), etc., no (6,6), so free. But there is food at (6,6), but for movement, I can move there.\n\n- D: (6,4) — similarly, (6,4) has food, but not obstacle, so free.\n\n- L: (5,5) — currently occupied by body, but moving to tail is allowed, but direction: moving left is opposite to current R, so not allowed.\n\n- R: (7,5) — x=7 is border wall, so blocked. Cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nNow, both have food: (6,6) and (6,4) both have positive food.\n\nBut I need to think about eating and consequences.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there. Since it's positive, snake length increases by one.\n\nSimilarly for D to (6,4).\n\nBut also, I need to consider long-term survival and future moves.\n\nMoreover, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, at turn 5, head at (6,5), tail at (5,5). Are they adjacent? (6,5) and (5,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nThe tail is at (5,5), and if I were to eat food at the tail position, but food is at (6,6) or (6,4), not at tail.\n\nCurrently, no food at tail position.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), I eat the food. New snake: head at (6,6), and since I ate, length increases, so body segments: the previous head (6,5) becomes body, and tail (5,5) remains, but since I ate, a new segment is added, so positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5). So snake length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (6,4), head at (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5).\n\nNow, for turn 5, I have two choices: U or D.\n\nI need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there are other foods: (3,1) and (2,5) with longer life_span, but they are far away.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells or map the grid.\n\nI should sketch a small grid.\n\nConsider the area around (6,5).\n\nx=6, y from 4 to 6.\n\n(6,4): food, free\n\n(6,5): snake head\n\n(6,6): food, free\n\nBelow: (6,3), not mentioned, should be free? y=3, within bounds.\n\nLeft: (5,5) snake body\n\nRight: (7,5) wall\n\nUp: (6,6) food\n\nDown: (6,4) food\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go up or down.\n\nNow, after moving, for example, if I go up to (6,6), then head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,6), direction U.\n\nCannot move D (down) because opposite to U? Current direction after move is U.\n\nIf I moved U to (6,6), new direction is U.\n\nThen at next turn, cannot move down (opposite).\n\nNow, from (6,6):\n\n- U: (6,7) — y=7 is border wall, blocked.\n\n- D: (6,5) — but (6,5) is now body segment? After moving to (6,6), snake positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), tail (5,5). So (6,5) is body.\n\nMoving to (6,5) is moving to body, which would cause collision, except if it's the tail, but here it's not tail, it's the second segment.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when moving to the tail cell.\n\nHere, (6,5) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would be collision.\n\n- L: (5,6) — (5,6) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n\n- R: (7,6) — x=7 wall, blocked.\n\nSo from (6,6), after moving there, the only possible moves are U, D, L, R, but U blocked by wall, D to (6,5) which is body, collision, L to (5,6) obstacle, R to (7,6) wall. All blocked! Snake would die.\n\nIf I move to (6,6), I immediately have no moves on the next turn, so I die.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (6,4) from (6,5).\n\nMove D to (6,4), eat food, new head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nSnake: head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D: (6,3) — not border, not obstacle, should be free.\n\n- U: (6,5) — body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- L: (5,4) — (5,4) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n\n- R: (7,4) — x=7 wall, blocked.\n\nAlso, cannot move U because opposite to current direction? Current direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nBut moving U to (6,5) is to body, collision.\n\nMoving L to (5,4) obstacle.\n\nR to (7,4) wall.\n\nD to (6,3) should be free.\n\nSo I can move down to (6,3).\n\nTherefore, moving to (6,4) is better because I can continue.\n\nMoving to (6,6) leads to death.\n\nSo for turn 5, if I am at (6,5), I should move D to (6,4), not U to (6,6).\n\nBut at turn 4, I moved to (6,5), so for turn 5, action should be D.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 4, I must move R to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 5, from (6,5), I move D to (6,4).\n\nNow, after moving to (6,4), I eat the food there, so snake grows to length 3: positions head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5).\n\nDirection now D.\n\nLife_span of food: after turn 4, all life_span decreased by 1, so (6,4) was eaten, so removed. (6,6) life_span was 6, after turn 4 to 5, it decreases to 4? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 4: current turn, we perform action.\n\nAfter action, state updates.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn, we have state, we choose action, then after action, the state changes for next turn.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn 4, before action, food life_span as given: (6,4) life_span 6.\n\nAfter turn 4 action, life_span decreases, so (6,4) life_span becomes 5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen at turn 5, before action, life_span are: (6,4) 5, (6,6) 5 (since both had 6), (3,1) 6 (was 7), (2,5) 9 (was 10).\n\nThen I move to (6,4) at turn 5, so I eat the food, so it's consumed, removed from board.\n\nSimilarly, life_span decreases for other foods.\n\nNow, after turn 5 action: moved D to (6,4), so head at (6,4), body: previous head (6,5) and tail (5,5), but since I ate, new segment, so positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5). Length 3.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, for turn 6: head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: current direction D, so cannot move U (up, opposite).\n\nNow, cells:\n\n- D: (6,3) — free? Not border, not obstacle, should be free.\n\n- U: (6,5) — but (6,5) is body segment, and not tail (tail is at (5,5)), so moving to body causes collision.\n\n- L: (5,4) — obstacle, blocked.\n\n- R: (7,4) — wall, blocked.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,3).\n\nMove D to (6,3).\n\nNo food there, so no growth. Snake moves: head to (6,3), body to (6,4), tail to (6,5). The tail was at (5,5), but when head moves to (6,3), the body segments: the segment at (6,4) moves to new head position? No.\n\nPositions before move: head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5).\n\nAfter move down to (6,3): head moves to (6,3), then the first body segment (at (6,5)) moves to previous head position (6,4), and the tail (at (5,5)) moves to previous first body position (6,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), tail (6,5).\n\nTail is now at (6,5).\n\nDirection now D.\n\nLife_span: after turn 5, all food life_span decrease. (6,6) was not eaten, life_span was 5, decreases to 4. (3,1) was 6 to 5, (2,5) 9 to 8.\n\n(6,4) was eaten, so gone.\n\nNow turn 6: head at (6,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,2), U to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision, L to (5,3) but (5,3) obstacle, R to (7,3) wall.\n\nCannot move U because opposite to D.\n\nSo only move D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) should be free.\n\nMove D to (6,2).\n\nNo food, so snake moves: head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (6,4).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: head (6,2), direction D.\n\nMove D to (6,1)? (6,1) not border, not obstacle.\n\ny=1, within bounds.\n\nMove D to (6,1).\n\nPositions: head (6,1), body (6,2), tail (6,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nBut now, I'm at (6,1), and borders are y=0, so I can go down to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, blocked.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- D: (6,0) — y=0 wall, blocked.\n\n- U: (6,2) — body segment, collision.\n\n- L: (5,1) — not obstacle? Obstacles include (2,1), (1,3), etc., not (5,1), so should be free.\n\n- R: (7,1) wall, blocked.\n\nCurrent direction D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nBut moving U to (6,2) is body, collision anyway.\n\nMoving L to (5,1) is possible, since not opposite? Direction is D, moving L is left, not opposite. Opposite of down is up.\n\nSo I can move left to (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, move R not possible.\n\nSo at turn 7, from (6,2), I move D to (6,1), then at turn 8, I must move L to (5,1) or something.\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nAfter turn 6: head (6,2), direction D\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,1)\n\nNow positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow turn 8: head (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D: (6,0) wall, blocked\n\n- U: (6,2) body, collision\n\n- L: (5,1) — free? Not obstacle, not wall.\n\n- R: (7,1) wall, blocked\n\nCannot move U (opposite), so only move L to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (5,1).\n\nNo food, so snake moves: head to (5,1), body to (6,1), tail to (6,2).\n\nDirection now L (since moved left).\n\nLife_span decreased each turn, but no food eaten yet since turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I ate (6,4), then moved to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), now to (5,1).\n\nAt (5,1), is there food? Food at (3,1), (2,5), etc.\n\n(5,1) not food.\n\nNow turn 9: head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: current direction L, so cannot move R (right, opposite).\n\nCells:\n\n- L: (4,1) — free? Not border, not obstacle.\n\n- R: (6,1) — body segment? Positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), tail (6,2). So (6,1) is body, not tail, so moving there collision.\n\n- U: (5,2) — not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), but (5,2) not listed, should be free.\n\n- D: (5,0) — y=0 wall, blocked.\n\nAlso, cannot move R because opposite and body.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to other food.\n\nThere is food at (3,1) and (2,5).\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is left and same y.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nAlso, (6,6) food might still be there, but life_span decreasing.\n\nCurrent turn: let's track the turns and life_span.\n\nStart turn 4: food life_span: (6,4):6, (6,6):6, (3,1):7, (2,5):10\n\nAfter turn 4 action: life_span decrease by 1, so (6,4):5, (6,6):5, (3,1):6, (2,5):9\n\nTurn 5: move to (6,4), eat it, so consumed. Life_span decrease for others: (6,6):4, (3,1):5, (2,5):8\n\nTurn 6: move to (6,3), no food. Life_span decrease: (6,6):3, (3,1):4, (2,5):7\n\nTurn 7: move to (6,2), no food. Life_span: (6,6):2, (3,1):3, (2,5):6\n\nTurn 8: move to (6,1), no food. Life_span: (6,6):1, (3,1):2, (2,5):5\n\nThen turn 8: after move to (6,1), but in turn 8 I moved to (5,1)? Let's correct.\n\nAt turn 7: after moving to (6,1), positions for turn 8 start.\n\nTurn 8: head at (6,1), direction D, I moved L to (5,1).\n\nAfter action, turn 8: head to (5,1), etc.\n\nLife_span decrease at each turn start or after action?\n\nTypically, life_span decreases every turn, meaning when the turn is processed.\n\nAt the beginning of each turn, before action, life_span decreases.\n\nI think it's standard to decrease life_span at the start of the turn or end? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for each turn, including when it appears, countdown decreases.\n\nIn this case, for turn t, before action, we have state, then we choose action, then after action, we update: move snake, eat food if applicable, decrease life_span, remove if life_span=0.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify the order, but let's assume: after the action is taken, life_span decreases for all food, and if life_span becomes 0, it disappears; also, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume:\n\n- At start of turn, life_span of all food decreases by 1.\n\n- If life_span <= 0, food disappears.\n\n- Then, snake moves based on action.\n\n- If head moves to a cell with food, it is eaten (if still there).\n\nIn the initial state, life_span is given, so at turn 4, before action, life_span as given.\n\nAfter action, when we go to next turn, life_span decreases.\n\nFor example, turn 4: before action, food at (6,4) life_span 6.\n\nAfter action (move R to (6,5)), no food eaten, then for next turn, life_span decreases.\n\nThen turn 5: before action, (6,4) life_span 5, etc.\n\nThen I move to (6,4), eat it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my earlier: turn 4 action: move R to (6,5), no eat.\n\nThen turn 5: before action, life_span decreased: (6,4):5, (6,6):5, (3,1):6, (2,5):9\n\nThen action: move D to (6,4), head moves to (6,4), which has food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nThen for turn 6, before action, life_span decrease: (6,6):4, (3,1):5, (2,5):8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBack to turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8: before action, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nLife_span: after turn 7 decrease, let's list:\n\nTurn 7: after turn 7 action (move to (6,1)), life_span decrease for turn 8 start? I need consistent.\n\nDefine:\n\n- State at turn t: given positions, direction, food with life_span.\n\n- Choose action for turn t.\n\n- After action:\n  - Snake moves: head to new position, body follows.\n  - If new head position has food (and it is present), eat it: snake grows by one, food removed.\n  - Then, for all food, life_span decreases by 1.\n  - If life_span <= 0, food disappears.\n\nThen next turn t+1.\n\nFor turn 4:\n\nStart: positions [(5,5), (4,5)], dir R, food: (6,4,6,1), (6,6,6,1), (3,1,7,1), (2,5,10,1)\n\nAction: move R to (6,5)\n\nNew head position: (6,5), no food there, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: [(6,5), (5,5)]  (tail moved)\n\nThen life_span decrease: (6,4) to 5, (6,6) to 5, (3,1) to 6, (2,5) to 9\n\nAll >0, so still present.\n\nTurn 5: start: positions [(6,5), (5,5)], dir R (since moved right)\n\nFood: (6,4,5,1), (6,6,5,1), (3,1,6,1), (2,5,9,1)\n\nAction: move D to (6,4)\n\nNew head position (6,4), has food, eat it. Snake grows: new positions head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5)  (length 3)\n\nThen life_span decrease: (6,4) eaten, removed. (6,6) to 4, (3,1) to 5, (2,5) to 8\n\nSo food left: (6,6,4,1), (3,1,5,1), (2,5,8,1)\n\nTurn 6: start: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], dir D (since moved down)\n\nAction: move D to (6,3)\n\nNo food at (6,3), so no eat. New positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), tail (6,5)  (since tail was (5,5), moves to (6,5))\n\nThen life_span decrease: (6,6) to 3, (3,1) to 4, (2,5) to 7\n\nTurn 7: start: positions [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)], dir D\n\nAction: move D to (6,2)\n\nNo food, new positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (6,4)\n\nLife_span decrease: (6,6) to 2, (3,1) to 3, (2,5) to 6\n\nTurn 8: start: positions [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4)], dir D\n\nAction: move D to (6,1)\n\nNo food, new positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nLife_span decrease: (6,6) to 1, (3,1) to 2, (2,5) to 5\n\nTurn 9: start: positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)], dir D\n\nAction: move L to (5,1)  (since only possible move, as before)\n\nNew head position (5,1), no food, so no eat. New positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), tail (6,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nLife_span decrease: (6,6) to 0, so disappears; (3,1) to 1, (2,5) to 4\n\nFood left: (3,1,1,1), (2,5,4,1)\n\nTurn 10: start: positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2)], dir L\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move R (right, opposite).\n\nCells:\n\n- L: (4,1) — free\n\n- R: (6,1) — body, collision\n\n- U: (5,2) — free? Not obstacle\n\n- D: (5,0) wall, blocked\n\nSo can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nNow, there is food at (3,1), which is left, and at (2,5) up.\n\n(3,1) has life_span 1, so at turn 10, before action, life_span decreases to 0? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 10 start, life_span decrease from previous.\n\nAfter turn 9 action, life_span decreased to: (3,1) to 1, (2,5) to 4? At turn 9 start: (3,1) life_span 2, (2,5) life_span 5? I think I messed up.\n\nLet's list life_span at start of each turn:\n\nTurn 4 start: (6,4):6, (6,6):6, (3,1):7, (2,5):10\n\nAfter turn 4 action: life_span dec: (6,4):5, (6,6):5, (3,1):6, (2,5):9\n\nTurn 5 start: food with (6,4,5), etc.\n\nAction: move to (6,4), eat it. Then life_span dec: (6,6):4, (3,1):5, (2,5):8\n\nTurn 6 start: (6,6,4), (3,1,5), (2,5,8)\n\nAction: move to (6,3), no eat. Then life_span dec: (6,6):3, (3,1):4, (2,5):7\n\nTurn 7 start: (6,6,3), (3,1,4), (2,5,7)\n\nAction: move to (6,2), no eat. Life_span dec: (6,6):2, (3,1):3, (2,5):6\n\nTurn 8 start: (6,6,2), (3,1,3), (2,5,6)\n\nAction: move to (6,1), no eat. Life_span dec: (6,6):1, (3,1):2, (2,5):5\n\nTurn 9 start: (6,6,1), (3,1,2), (2,5,5)\n\nAction: move to (5,1), no eat. Then life_span dec: (6,6):0, disappear; (3,1):1, (2,5):4\n\nSo turn 10 start: food (3,1,1,1), (2,5,4,1)\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body (6,1), tail (6,2), dir L\n\nNow, action for turn 10.\n\nMove to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nFood at (3,1) with life_span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears after this turn.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is two steps left from (5,1).\n\nIf I move left to (4,1), then I can reach (3,1) next turn if possible.\n\nIf I move up to (5,2), I might go towards (2,5).\n\nBut (3,1) will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 10 start, life_span 1.\n\nAfter action, if I move to (3,1) and eat it, good, but I'm at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), then at (4,1), no food.\n\nThen after action, life_span decrease: (3,1) to 0, disappear, so I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (5,2), same thing.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,1) at turn 10 because it's not adjacent; I need to move to it directly.\n\nTo eat food, I must move the head to the food cell.\n\nAt turn 10, I am at (5,1), food at (3,1) which is two cells away, so I cannot reach it in one move. After this turn, it disappears.\n\nSo I will miss (3,1) food.\n\n(2,5) has life_span 4, so still time.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I can move to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), then head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,1), but (3,1) will be gone after this turn.\n\nAt turn 10 action: if I move to (4,1), no food there. Then after action, life_span dec, (3,1) to 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,2), same.\n\nSo I cannot get (3,1).\n\nOnly (2,5) left.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), which is up-left.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I move U to (5,2), then I can go towards (2,5).\n\nOr move L to (4,1), then need to go up.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's list the path to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nI am at (5,1), so need to go up and left.\n\nBut obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), (5,6) are obstacles, so at y=3,4,6 for x=5.\n\nAlso, (1,3), (2,3), (1,6), (3,6) etc.\n\nSpecifically, for x=5, y=3,4,6 blocked.\n\nSo from (5,1), if I move U to (5,2), then at (5,2), I can move U to (5,3), but (5,3) is obstacle, blocked.\n\nOr move L to (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: cannot move D (down, opposite).\n\n- U: (5,3) — obstacle, blocked\n\n- D: (5,1) — body? Positions: after move to (5,2), body: previous head (5,1) becomes body, tail (6,1) moves to (6,2)? Positions at turn 10 start: head (5,1), body (6,1), tail (6,2)\n\nAfter move U to (5,2): new head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (6,1)  (since tail moves to previous body position)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen at turn 11: head (5,2), dir U\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,3) obstacle, blocked\n\n- D: (5,1) body, collision\n\n- L: (4,2) free? Not obstacle\n\n- R: (6,2) body? (6,2) is tail? Positions: body (5,1), tail (6,1), so (6,2) not occupied? After positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (6,1)\n\nSo (6,2) is free.\n\nBut R: (6,2) — from (5,2) to (6,2), that's right, x+1.\n\n(6,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, L: (4,2) free.\n\nD: (5,1) body, collision.\n\nU blocked.\n\nSo can move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nNow, to reach (2,5), I need to go left and up.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (5,2), moving left to (4,2) is better.\n\nThen to (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,3), but (2,3) is obstacle? Obstacles include (2,3), so (2,3) blocked.\n\nAlso (1,3) blocked.\n\nSo need to go around.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go up to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nBack to turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, I had only one choice: move R to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 5, I moved D to (6,4) to avoid dying.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nAt turn 5, from (6,5), I could only move D or U, and U leads to death, so D is only good choice.\n\nBut in the long run, I missed the (3,1) food and might have difficulty reaching (2,5).\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I should have planned to go towards (2,5) or (3,1).\n\nBut at turn 4, I had no choice but to go right.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 4, when I moved to (6,5), I didn't eat food, but at turn 5, I ate (6,4).\n\nBut the snake is now trapped in the bottom-right corner, and (2,5) is top-left.\n\nWith obstacles, it might be hard to reach.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), to go to (2,5), I need to go up to y=5, but at x=5, y=3 and 4 are blocked, so I need to go left first to x=4 or less, then up.\n\nAt x=4, y=3: not obstacle, I think.\n\nObstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo (4,3) is free, (4,4) free, etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1) at turn 10.\n\nThen from (4,1), move U to (4,2), etc.\n\nUp to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) free? Then to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is food, so I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go through (5,2), but at (5,2), I can go L to (4,2), then U, same.\n\nBut (2,5) life_span is 4 at turn 10 start, so I have time.\n\nTurn 10: at (5,1), move to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nSay move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 11: head (4,1), dir L\n\nCan move L to (3,1), but (3,1) food is gone after turn 10, so at turn 11, no food there.\n\nMove U to (4,2) or D to (4,0) wall, or R to (5,1) body.\n\nSo move U to (4,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can reach (2,5) in a few turns.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate actions for the answer.\n\nThe user asks for actions starting from turn 4 for several turns.\n\nSince at turn 4, only one choice, and turn 5, only one good choice, etc.\n\nBut in turn 5, I had a choice, but U was bad.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 4,5,6,etc.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can think of a better path from the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 4, when I move to (6,5), then at turn 5, instead of moving D, I moved U to (6,6), but that leads to death, as I saw earlier.\n\nNo, I must move D.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that food under body, but here no.\n\nOr the tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nSo I think the path I have is the only way.\n\nFor the answer, I'll write the actions.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4)  // eat food\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (5,1)\n\nThen I can continue, but for 5 turns ahead, from turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nTurn 4 action, then turn 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n5+ turns, so at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=4, so actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D  // to (6,1)\n\nBut at turn 8, from (6,2), move D to (6,1)\n\nThen for turn 9, I have move L to (5,1), but that's turn 9.\n\nFor up to turn 8, actions: 4,5,6,7,8 all defined.\n\nBut at turn 8, position (6,1), then for turn 9, I need to move L, but not in the 5-turns.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, I can include turn 9.\n\nBut the answer format should list actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps list from turn 4 to as many as I can, but at least 5.\n\nIn this case, up to turn 8 is 5 actions: t4,t5,t6,t7,t8.\n\nt4 to t8 is 5 turns.\n\nt4, t5, t6, t7, t8.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, all moves are forced until turn 9.\n\nSo for the answer, I can write:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nBut at turn 8, moving to (6,1), which is fine.\n\nThen for long-term, after that, I can go to (5,1) and towards (2,5).\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nBut is there a way to get the (3,1) food?\n\nAt turn 4, if I could, but I couldn't move left.\n\nPerhaps later, but I was at (6,1) when (3,1) disappeared.\n\nIf at turn 5, I didn't eat (6,4), but I had to move, and moving to (6,4) is the only way, and I ate it.\n\nSuppose at turn 5, from (6,5), I move D to (6,4), which I did.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nBut turn 8 is from (6,2) to (6,1), with direction D, and only move D to (6,1), yes.\n\nThen turn 9: L to (5,1), but not included.\n\nFor the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 4):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (5,5), body at (4,5). Snake length is 2.\n- **Head Direction**: Right (R).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: \n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacles at (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,4): Value +1, Life-span 6 (will disappear after turn 9 if not eaten).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, Life-span 6 (will disappear after turn 9).\n  - (3,1): Value +1, Life-span 7 (will disappear after turn 10).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, Life-span 10 (will disappear after turn 13).\n\n**Immediate Constraints (Turn 4):**\n- From head position (5,5) with direction R:\n  - Up (U) to (5,6): Blocked by obstacle (5,6).\n  - Down (D) to (5,4): Blocked by obstacle (5,4).\n  - Left (L) to (4,5): Occupied by tail, but moving to tail is allowed; however, instant reverse is prohibited (cannot move opposite to current direction R), so L is invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (6,5): Free cell (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n- **Only possible action on turn 4 is R to (6,5)**.\n\n**Turn 5 Considerations:**\n- After moving to (6,5) on turn 4:\n  - Snake: Head at (6,5), body at (5,5). Direction is R.\n  - Food life-span decreases: (6,4) to 5, (6,6) to 5, (3,1) to 6, (2,5) to 9.\n- From (6,5) with direction R:\n  - Up (U) to (6,6): Free cell with food, but moving here leads to a dead end (no escape on next turn due to walls/obstacles).\n  - Down (D) to (6,4): Free cell with food, allows continuation.\n  - Left (L) to (5,5): Occupied by body, and instant reverse prohibited.\n  - Right (R) to (7,5): Border wall, blocked.\n- **Moving U to (6,6) is fatal** (no moves on turn 6). **Moving D to (6,4) is safe** and eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating (2,5) (high life-span) while avoiding risks. (3,1) will expire soon and is unreachable safely.\n- **Path after turn 5**:\n  - After eating (6,4) on turn 5, snake is at (6,4) with direction D.\n  - Subsequent moves are forced due to constraints until reaching (6,1) on turn 8.\n  - From (6,1), move left to (5,1) on turn 9 to access open area.\n  - Then navigate toward (2,5) (e.g., via (4,1), (4,2), etc.), which has sufficient life-span (4 turns left at turn 10).\n- **Why avoid (3,1)**: At (5,1) on turn 9, (3,1) has life-span 1 and is two cells away—cannot be reached before expiring on turn 10.\n- **Risk Assessment**: All moves prioritize avoiding dead ends and collisions. No negative food present.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 4 to 9):**\n- Actions are determined based on immediate constraints and long-term survival.\n- Turns 4-8 have forced moves; turn 9 is the first choice point to head toward (2,5).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: D (down)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \nTurn 7: D (down)  \nTurn 8: D (down)  \nTurn 9: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly for y: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. But let's list the internal obstacles too.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)]\n\nSo these are cells that are blocked and can't be moved into.\n\nNow snake positions: head at (6,5), body at (5,5). So the snake has only two segments? Head and one body segment, which is the tail. So length 2.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right. So moving east.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 6, value 1\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9, value 1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so all are +1 food.\n\nLife span: for (6,4) and (6,6), life span 5 at turn 5, so they disappear after 5 turns? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf at turn t, life span is N, then after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it lasts for N turns.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+N or something. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, it has N turns left including the current one? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the beginning of turn, the life span is checked, and if it's 1, after the turn it disappears? But let's see the example.\n\nIt says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is given at turn t.\n\nFor food at (6,4), life span 5 at turn 5. So at turn 5, countdown is 5. After turn 5 is processed, countdown becomes 4. It will disappear when countdown reaches 0, which would be after turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, life span = L.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown becomes L-1.\n\nAfter turn t+1, countdown becomes L-2, and so on.\n\nWhen countdown reaches 0, after that turn, the food disappears.\n\nSo for L=5 at turn t=5:\n\n- Turn 5: countdown=5, after turn, countdown=4\n\n- Turn 6: countdown=4, after turn, countdown=3\n\n- Turn 7: countdown=3, after turn, countdown=2\n\n- Turn 8: countdown=2, after turn, countdown=1\n\n- Turn 9: countdown=1, after turn, countdown=0 → disappears before turn 10 or at start of turn 10? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now.\n\nFrom turn t, after N turns, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t, it has been present for 0 turns? Let's think differently.\n\nTypically: when a food is spawned, it has life span N, meaning it will disappear after N full turns.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, with life span L, it means it will be there for L more turns, including the current one? I'm confused.\n\nLet me read the rule again: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn, the countdown is for that turn, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at turn t, the food has life span L, meaning it will disappear after turn t + L - 1. For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t.\n\nIf L=2 at turn t, it is available on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, for L=5 at turn 5, it will be available on turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9, so not available on turn 10.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 inclusive is 5 turns: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 5: available, countdown=5\n\nAfter turn 5: countdown=4\n\nAt turn 6: available, countdown=4\n\nAfter turn 6: countdown=3\n\n...\nAt turn 9: available, countdown=1\n\nAfter turn 9: countdown=0, disappears.\n\nSo for (6,4) and (6,6), life span 5 at turn 5, available until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 6 at turn 5, available until turn 5+6-1=10? Let's see: at turn 5, L=6, so available turns 5 to 10? Turns 5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 6 turns.\n\nAt turn 5: L=6, after turn L=5\n\nTurn 6: L=5, after turn L=4\n\n...\nTurn 10: L=1, after turn L=0, disappears.\n\nYes, so available from turn 5 to turn 10 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 9 at turn 5, available until turn 13.\n\nBut we need to plan only for a few turns ahead, but think 5+ turns.\n\nNow, snake is at [(6,5), (5,5)] with head at (6,5), direction R (right).\n\nSo possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse.\n\nSo from (6,5), moving R would go to (7,5), but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move right.\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,5) is invalid, collision with wall.\n\nMoving up to (6,6)? y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable? y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are valid.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(6,5) to up: (6,6)\n\nTo down: (6,4)\n\nTo left: (5,5), but (5,5) is the body segment, but it's the tail.\n\nNow, moving to the tail: rule says \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if head moves to (5,5), which is the current tail, after the move, the tail will move away, so it's safe, as long as no other body collision.\n\nSnake has only two segments, head and tail. So moving to (5,5) should be fine, because after move, head is at (5,5), tail was at (5,5) but moves to where? When snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail moves away, so the cell is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell not food, then tail is removed, so the cell (5,5) is empty after tail moves.\n\nBut if head moves to food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (5,5), which is the current tail position, but (5,5) has no food, I think? Food positions are given, (5,5) is snake body, not food.\n\nSo if head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by tail, but since it's the tail, and we move there, then the tail will move away, so head occupies (5,5), and the tail segment is removed or moved? Let's think the mechanics.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it's not food, the tail moves forward, so the cell where tail was is freed.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that was tail, and tail moves away, then no collision.\n\nHere, snake positions: head (6,5), tail (5,5). If head moves left to (5,5), then after move, head is at (5,5), and since (5,5) was tail, but now head is there, and tail was at (5,5), but it needs to move to the next segment, but there is no next, so tail is removed? Snake has only two segments.\n\nAfter moving left to (5,5): new head position is (5,5), and since we didn't eat food, the tail is removed, so the snake becomes [(5,5)] only? But that doesn't make sense; snake should have at least head.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nInitial state: snake segments: position 0: (6,5) head, position 1: (5,5) tail.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, say to (x,y).\n\nIf (x,y) is not food, then the tail is removed, so new snake: head at (x,y), and the body segments shift: the old head becomes new body, but since only two segments, new head at (x,y), and the old tail is gone, so only one segment? No.\n\nStandard: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail if no food eaten.\n\nSo if head moves to new cell not food, new snake: new head at new position, and the previous head becomes the body, and the tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, from [(6,5), (5,5)], if head moves to, say, (6,6), not food, then new snake: head at (6,6), and body is (6,5), and (5,5) is removed, so snake becomes [(6,6), (6,5)].\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to (5,5), which is the current tail position.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by the tail segment. But when we move head to (5,5), since (5,5) is not food (assuming no food there), then new head at (5,5), and the previous head (6,5) becomes the new body, and the tail (5,5) is removed. But the tail was at (5,5), and we are moving head to (5,5), so the cell (5,5) is now the new head, and since we didn't eat food, the tail is removed, but the tail was at the same position, so it's like the snake shortens? No.\n\nLet's think: before move, cells: (6,5) head, (5,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,5): the new head is at (5,5), and the previous head (6,5) becomes the body segment. The tail (5,5) is to be removed, but since it's the same cell as new head, it might be a problem.\n\nBut in terms of position, the new snake should be: segments: new head at (5,5), and body at (6,5), and the old tail is gone. But (5,5) was tail, but now it's head, and (6,5) is body.\n\nThe cell (5,5) had the tail, but after move, the tail is removed, and new head is placed at (5,5), so it's fine, no collision because the tail is no longer there when head moves in.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, for a two-segment snake, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, meaning it is removed, so the cell is free for head.\n\nSimilarly, if snake is longer, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves to next position.\n\nSo here, moving to (5,5) is possible and safe.\n\nAlso, moving to other directions.\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- U: to (6,6)\n\n- D: to (6,4)\n\n- L: to (5,5)\n\n- R: to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo valid moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's see what is at these cells.\n\nFirst, (6,6): is there food? Food at (6,6) with value 1, life span 5.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) has food with value 1.\n\n(5,5) has no food, it's the current tail.\n\nAlso, need to consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: list: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, (5,3) obstacle, (5,4) obstacle, etc.\n\nFor moving to (6,6): (6,6) is a valid cell? x=6, y=6, walls at x=7 and y=7, so (6,6) is corner but playable, I think. x=6 is between 1 and 6? x from 1 to 6 inclusive, since x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(6,6) is playable.\n\nIs (6,6) an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,6), etc., not (6,6), so (6,6) is free, but has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) has food.\n\n(5,5) is current tail, no food.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there, since head moves to food cell. Then snake grows: new head at (6,6), and the tail stays, so snake becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]? After eating, the snake grows, so new head at food position, and body is previous head, and tail remains.\n\nStandard: if head moves to food, snake grows by one, so tail is not removed, a new segment is added.\n\nSo from [(6,5), (5,5)], move to (6,6) which is food, so new snake: head at (6,6), body segments: (6,5) and (5,5), so positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)], length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,4), which is food, same thing, grow to length 3 with head at (6,4).\n\nIf move to (5,5), not food, so no growth, new head at (5,5), body at (6,5), tail removed, so snake becomes [(5,5), (6,5)], but now head at (5,5), body at (6,5), so direction changes.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nNow, current turn 5.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (6,4) : available until turn 9 (life span 5 from turn 5)\n\n- (6,6) : available until turn 9\n\n- (3,1) : available until turn 10 (life span 6)\n\n- (2,5) : available until turn 13 (life span 9)\n\nAll value 1.\n\nSnake is at (6,5), can move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), I eat food, grow to length 3, head at (6,6), direction now U (since moved up).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (6,4), eat food, grow, head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nIf move L to (5,5), no food, no growth, head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nNow, need to consider the board and obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells outside 1-6 are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo (5,6) is obstacle, (5,3), (5,4), etc.\n\nNow, (5,4) is obstacle, so if I move down to (6,4), (6,4) is not obstacle, it has food.\n\n(6,4) is a cell, and it has food, not obstacle.\n\nObstacles are separate.\n\n(5,4) is obstacle, but (6,4) is not.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is not.\n\nSo moving to (6,6) or (6,4) is possible and I eat food.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, and I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, for (6,6) or (6,4), is the head adjacent to tail? Current head (6,5), tail (5,5). Are they adjacent? (6,5) and (5,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is not on the tail cell; it's on (6,6) or (6,4), not on tail.\n\nThe tail is at (5,5), no food there.\n\nSo eating (6,6) or (6,4) should be fine.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself, but here it's not.\n\nFor example, if tail had food and I eat it, but in this case, no food on tail.\n\nSo moving to (6,6) or (6,4) eats food and grows safely.\n\nMoving to (5,5) doesn't eat food, no growth.\n\nBut (5,5) is safe to move to.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nThe snake is near the right wall at x=6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6), etc.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, (5,3), (5,4), so at x=5, y=3,4,6 are obstacles, so only y=1,2,5 might be free, but y=1 and y=2 at x=5? Not necessarily, but for moving to (5,5), it's free.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: from (5,5), can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse, since previous direction was R, but after moving L, direction is L, so from (5,5) with direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nBut U to (5,6): (5,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (4,5): possible, if no wall or obstacle.\n\n(4,5) is within bounds, x=4,y=5, and not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,5) after moving left is L to (4,5), since U and D are blocked by obstacles.\n\n(5,6) obstacle, (5,4) obstacle, so only left to (4,5) is possible.\n\nThen at (4,5), no food, so snake would be head at (4,5), body at (5,5), and tail was (6,5) but removed, so snake [(4,5), (5,5)] if we moved L initially.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 5, I have three choices: U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), eat food, grow to length 3: positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 6, from (6,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction U, so can move U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n\nU to (6,7): but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,6): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5): but reverse, not allowed since direction is U, moving D would be opposite.\n\nSo from (6,6) with direction U, no valid moves! All directions invalid or reverse.\n\nU: (6,7) wall\n\nR: (7,6) wall\n\nL: (5,6) obstacle\n\nD: reverse, not allowed\n\nSo snake would die if I move to (6,6) because no valid moves next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (6,6) is suicidal, must avoid.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (6,4).\n\nHead to (6,4), eat food, grow to [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 6, from (6,4) with direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R, not U (reverse).\n\nD to (6,3): possible? y=3, within 1-6, and not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,3), (5,4), but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,4): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,5): reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,3).\n\nThen move to (6,3), not food (no food there), so snake: new head (6,3), body (6,4), and tail (6,5)? After eating at (6,4), snake is [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nMove to (6,3) not food, so new head (6,3), body (6,4), and tail removed, so snake becomes [(6,3), (6,4)]\n\nThen head at (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 7, from (6,3), move D, L, R, not U.\n\nD to (6,2): possible, free?\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,3) wall invalid.\n\nU to (6,4) reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nThen to (6,2), not food, snake [(6,2), (6,3)]\n\nThen turn 8, from (6,2), can move D, L, R, not U.\n\nD to (6,1): possible, free? y=1, x=6.\n\nL to (5,2): not obstacle, free? (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (7,2) wall invalid.\n\nU to (6,3) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nBut let's see the food; I need to plan to eat more.\n\nBut moving down to (6,4) might lead to being stuck in the bottom right.\n\nNow, back to turn 5, if I move L to (5,5).\n\nThen no food eaten, snake becomes [(5,5), (6,5)], head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5), with direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (5,6): (5,6) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (4,5): possible, free.\n\nSo only L to (4,5).\n\nMove to (4,5), not food (food at (3,1), (2,5), etc., not (4,5)), so snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail removed? After moving to (4,5), not food, so new head (4,5), body (5,5), and old tail (6,5) removed, so snake [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,5), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,6): possible? y=6, x=4.\n\nIs (4,6) obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,6), (5,6), but (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\nD to (4,4): possible, free? (4,4) not listed.\n\nL to (3,5): possible.\n\nR to (5,5) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, food at (3,1), (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5, which is to the left.\n\n(3,1) is down left.\n\nAlso, (4,5) is current position.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), not food.\n\nOr U to (4,6), not food.\n\nD to (4,4), not food.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards food.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger later.\n\nFirst, at turn 5, moving U to (6,6) is bad, as we saw, no moves next turn.\n\nMoving D to (6,4) is possible, but then I might be stuck going down.\n\nMoving L to (5,5) is safe and opens up the board.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (2,5) which is to the left, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 6.\n\nBut (2,5) is closer.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the obstacles.\n\nList free cells.\n\nGrid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nObstacles: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\nSo at x=5: y=3,4,6 obstacles, so only y=1,2,5 free? (5,1), (5,2), (5,5)\n\nSimilarly, other areas.\n\nNow, from current, if I move L to (5,5), then to (4,5), then I can go to (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) has food.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), not food.\n\nThen from (3,5), can move towards (2,5) or other.\n\n(2,5) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (5,5), no eat, snake [(5,5), (6,5)] but after move: head at (5,5), body at (6,5), so positions [(5,5), (6,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (4,5), not food, snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail removed, so [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), direction L, move L to (3,5), not food, snake head (3,5), body (4,5), so [(3,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (3,4): possible, free? (3,4) not obstacle.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) has food.\n\nR to (4,5) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\nIf move L to (2,5), eat food, grow to length 3: head (2,5), body (3,5), body (4,5)? Snake was [(3,5), (4,5)], move to (2,5) food, so new head (2,5), body (3,5), and since ate, add new segment? Grow, so positions: new head at (2,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, and the tail (4,5) remains, so [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut at turn 5, if I don't move L, and instead move D to (6,4), I eat food, grow to length 3, but then at (6,4), and only can move down to (6,3), then to (6,2), and so on, which might be dead end or less opportunity.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), I can move left to (5,2), since (5,2) is free, no obstacle.\n\nThen to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc., but (5,1) might be free, but (2,1) is obstacle, so y=1 row has obstacles at (2,1), but (1,1) to (6,1) except obstacles.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nMoreover, the food at (3,1) is down there, but life span 6, available until turn 10.\n\nBut by moving down, I might reach it.\n\nBut let's compare scores.\n\nIf I move L at turn 5, I don't eat immediately, but I can eat (2,5) later, and it's safe.\n\nIf I move D, I eat (6,4) immediately, but then I might be constrained.\n\nAlso, moving to (6,4) and then down, I might not get other food easily.\n\nThere is also (6,6) food, but moving to (6,6) is bad as we saw.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 5, if I move to (6,6), it's death, so must avoid.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), it's not immediate death, but risky if I go down.\n\nBut let's see the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nCurrently, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, if the head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, no food on tail.\n\nSo for now.\n\nPerhaps moving L is better for long-term.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 5: t=5\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output should be for a sequence, I think, but the format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many to output. It says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably I need to provide a sequence, but for how long? Until a decision point or something.\n\nBut since it's to maximize score, and I need to survive, I should plan a path to eat food safely.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to go for (2,5) food.\n\nFrom current position (6,5), if I move L to (5,5), then to (4,5) on turn 6, then to (3,5) on turn 7, then to (2,5) on turn 8, eating food at turn 8.\n\nThen score +1 at turn 8.\n\nIf I move down to (6,4) at turn 5, eat now, score +1 now, but then I go down to (6,3), (6,2), etc., and I can go to (5,2) or something, but to reach (3,1), it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) at some point, I can move left to (5,2), then to (4,2), (3,2), then down to (3,1), but (3,1) has food, but at (3,2), I need to move down to (3,1), which is food.\n\nBut (3,1) life span 6, available until turn 10, so possible.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat at turn 8, in second, I eat at turn 5 but then later I might eat (3,1).\n\nBut both get one food so far, but in the first plan, by moving L, I avoid the risky area.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,5), I can go for other food.\n\nAlso, there is (3,1) and the one at (6,6) but (6,6) might disappear or not, but I can't reach it safely from left.\n\nAnother food: (6,4) and (6,6) are both near, but (6,6) I can't eat because it leads to death, as we saw.\n\n(6,6) is only accessible if I come from below or left, but from below is not possible since y=7 wall, from left, (5,6) is obstacle, so (6,6) can only be accessed from (6,5) or (7,6) but (7,6) invalid, so only from (6,5) directly, which is up.\n\nBut moving up to (6,6) is bad as no exit.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) can be accessed from (6,5) or (6,3) or (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, so from (6,5) or (6,3).\n\nBut from (6,3) I can move up to (6,4), but if I go down to (6,3) first, then I can go up to (6,4), but at that time, if food is still there.\n\nLife span: (6,4) available until turn 9, so if I go down and come back, I might eat it later.\n\nFor example, if I move L at turn 5 to (5,5), then to (4,5) turn 6, to (3,5) turn 7, to (2,5) turn 8 eat.\n\nThen from (2,5), head at (2,5), direction L, I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (2,6): possible? (2,6) not obstacle, but internal obstacles: (1,6), (3,6), not (2,6), so free.\n\nD to (2,4): possible, free? (2,4) not listed.\n\nL to (1,5): x=1, y=5, but x=1 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable.\n\nBut (1,5) not obstacle, but obstacles: (1,3), (1,6), not (1,5), so free.\n\nBut (1,3) is obstacle, but (1,5) is different.\n\nSo from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5).\n\nThen I can go towards (3,1) or other.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so from (2,5) move D to (2,4), then to (2,3) but (2,3) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(2,3) is obstacle, so from (2,5), moving D to (2,4), then from (2,4), can move D to (2,3) but obstacle, invalid, or L to (1,4), or R to (3,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), I need to go around.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I didn't move to (2,5), but in the sequence, I did.\n\nAt turn 8, from (3,5) I move to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen after, head at (2,5), I can move down to (2,4), since (2,3) obstacle, cannot go directly down.\n\nFrom (2,4), then to (2,3) invalid, so move left to (1,4) or right to (3,4).\n\nThen to (3,4), then down to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) food available until turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat if I reach.\n\nSimilarly, in the down path.\n\nBut let's see which is better.\n\nAlso, moving to (6,4) at turn 5: eat, grow to [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (6,3), not food, snake to [(6,3), (6,4)] (since no eat, tail removed)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2), not food, snake [(6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTurn 8: from (6,2), move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf move D to (6,1), not food, snake [(6,1), (6,2)]\n\nThen from (6,1), can move L to (5,1) or U to (6,2) reverse not, or D invalid y=0 wall.\n\nD to (6,0) invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1) if possible.\n\n(5,1) not obstacle, free? Obstacles: (2,1), but (5,1) not listed, so free.\n\nMove to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc., to (3,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is obstacle, so from (5,1) to (4,1), to (3,1) directly? (3,1) is food, but from (4,1) move to (3,1), eat.\n\nBut in terms of turns, it takes longer.\n\nAt turn 5: move to (6,4) eat at t5.\n\nThen turn 6: to (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: to (6,2)\n\nTurn 8: to (6,1) or to (5,2)\n\nSay to (6,1) at t8.\n\nThen turn 9: to (5,1) at t9.\n\nThen turn 10: to (4,1) or to (3,1)? From (5,1), can move U, D, L, R? Direction from moving left? From (6,1) to (5,1), direction L.\n\nThen at (5,1), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (5,2): possible, free.\n\nD to (5,0) invalid.\n\nL to (4,1): possible.\n\nR to (6,1) reverse not.\n\nSo move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nTo reach (3,1), move to (4,1) then to (3,1).\n\nAt (4,1), move to (3,1) if food, but (3,1) is food, so eat at turn 10 or 11.\n\nTurn 10: from (4,1) to (3,1) eat.\n\nSequence: t5: to (6,4) eat\n\nt6: to (6,3)\n\nt7: to (6,2)\n\nt8: to (6,1)  // assuming move down\n\nt9: to (5,1)\n\nt10: to (4,1)? From (5,1) move to (4,1) or directly to (3,1)? (3,1) is adjacent to (4,1)? (4,1) to (3,1) is left.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1) at t9, then t10 to (3,1) eat.\n\nEat at t10.\n\nCompared to moving left first: eat at (2,5) at t8, which is earlier.\n\nIn left path, eat at t8, in down path, eat at t5 and then at t10, so two foods, but in down path, I ate at t5 and then at t10, so +2, while in left path, I ate only at t8 so far, but I can eat more later.\n\nIn down path: at t5 eat (6,4), then at t10 eat (3,1), so two foods by turn 10.\n\nIn left path: at t8 eat (2,5), and if I go to (3,1), I can eat that too.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,5) at t8, head at (2,5), move D to (2,4) at t9, then from (2,4), can move L to (1,4) or R to (3,4), since (2,3) obstacle.\n\nMove R to (3,4) at t9? t9 from (2,4) to (3,4).\n\nNot food.\n\nThen t10: from (3,4) move D to (3,3), etc., to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) at t10, if I reach, but turn 10 is the last turn for (3,1)? Available until turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat if head moves to it.\n\nAt turn 10, if head at (3,1), I eat.\n\nBut from (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1), that's three moves.\n\nAfter eating (2,5) at t8, positions [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]? After eating at (2,5), snake is [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,4), not food, so snake head (2,4), body (2,5), tail removed? No eat, so new head (2,4), body (2,5), and tail (3,5) removed? Snake segments: after move, head to new position, previous head becomes body, tail removed if no eat.\n\nSo from [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)], move to (2,4) not food, so new head (2,4), body (2,5), and tail (4,5) removed? The segments: position 0 head (2,5), position 1 body (3,5), position 2 tail (4,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (2,4), new head (2,4), the previous head (2,5) becomes body segment, and the tail (4,5) is removed. So new snake: [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nOnly two segments now.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 10: from (2,4), move D to (2,3) but (2,3) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n\nSay move R to (3,4), then snake head (3,4), body (2,4), so [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nThen turn 11: to (3,3) or other, but (3,1) available only until turn 10, so at turn 10, (3,1) is available, but I am at (3,4) or (2,4), not at (3,1), so I miss it.\n\nTo eat (3,1) at turn 10, I need to be at (3,1) or adjacent to move in.\n\nAt turn 9, after move to (2,4), I could move directly towards (3,1), but (2,3) obstacle, so I have to go to (3,4) or (1,4), then down.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,4) at turn 9, then at turn 10, from (3,4) I can move to (3,3), but (3,1) is at y=1, so I need to go to (3,2) then (3,1), but at turn 10, if I move to (3,3), (3,1) disappears after turn 10? Available until turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat it if I move to (3,1).\n\nBut from (3,4) at turn 10, I can move down to (3,3), but not to (3,1) directly.\n\nSo I cannot reach (3,1) on turn 10; I can only be at (3,3) at best, so (3,1) not eaten, disappears.\n\nIn the left path, I eat (2,5) at t8, but miss (3,1).\n\nIn the down path, I eat (6,4) at t5 and (3,1) at t10, so two foods.\n\nBut in down path, when I go to (6,1), I could have eaten (6,6) later? But (6,6) is only from (6,5), which I left.\n\nAt turn 6, after eating (6,4), I go to (6,3), not back.\n\nAnd (6,6) available until turn 9, so if I am at (6,5) at some point, but I am not.\n\nSo only two foods in down path.\n\nIn left path, only one food so far, but I can eat (2,5) and perhaps other.\n\nThere is (6,4) and (6,6) but (6,6) I can't eat, as established.\n\n(6,4) might be eaten if I go back, but from left, it might be far.\n\nAt turn 5, if I move L, I can later come back to eat (6,4) if possible.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can move down or other.\n\nBut let's see the best action.\n\nAlso, I need to consider survival.\n\nIn the down path, after going to (6,1), I can move to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc., which is open.\n\nIn left path, after (2,5), I can go to (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\nBut both seem viable.\n\nBut in down path, I get immediate food and another later, while in left path, I get food later but only one so far.\n\nAt turn 5, moving to (6,4) gives +1 now, and then I can potentially eat (3,1) at t10.\n\nIn left path, moving to (5,5) no eat, then to (4,5) no eat, to (3,5) no eat, to (2,5) eat at t8, so first eat at t8.\n\nThen no other food easily, and (3,1) missed.\n\nSo down path has two foods, left path has one.\n\nBut in down path, when I move to (6,4) at t5, I grow to length 3, then when I move to (6,3) at t6, no eat, so snake shrinks to length 2, then to (6,2) length 2, to (6,1) length 2, etc., so I don't keep the growth.\n\nWhen I eat at t5, length becomes 3, then at t6 move to (6,3) not food, so tail removed, length back to 2.\n\nSimilarly, when I eat at t10, length increases again.\n\nIn left path, at t8 eat, length 3.\n\nBut score is based on eating food, not length directly, but each food +1.\n\nSo down path: eat at t5 and t10, score +2.\n\nLeft path: eat at t8, score +1, and no other food eaten in the sequence, so +1.\n\nBut I can eat more, but in the grid, with obstacles, it might be hard.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,5) in left path, I can go to (1,5), then to (1,4), etc., but no other food.\n\nOr to (3,1) but I missed it.\n\n(2,5) has life span 9, available until turn 13, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut at turn 8 I eat it in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should move to (6,4) at t5 to get the food and then have more options.\n\nBut moving to (6,4) and then down might lead to a dead end.\n\nFor example, at (6,1), I can move to (5,1), then to (4,1), then to (3,1) at t8? Let's timeline.\n\nt5: move D to (6,4) eat, snake [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] len 3\n\nt6: move D to (6,3) not food, snake [(6,3), (6,4)] len 2 (tail removed)\n\nt7: move D to (6,2) not food, snake [(6,2), (6,3)] len 2\n\nt8: move D to (6,1) not food, snake [(6,1), (6,2)] len 2\n\nt9: move L to (5,1) not food, snake [(5,1), (6,1)] len 2\n\nt10: move L to (4,1) not food, snake [(4,1), (5,1)] len 2\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move to (3,1) at t11, but (3,1) available only until turn 10, so at t11 it is gone, cannot eat.\n\nAt t10, I am at (4,1), can I move to (3,1)? Yes, if I do.\n\nAt t9, at (5,1), I can move directly to (4,1) or to (3,1)? (3,1) is not adjacent to (5,1), so cannot.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1) at t9, then at t10 from (4,1) to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut at t10, (3,1) is available, since available until turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 10, countdown=1, after turn it disappears, so during turn 10 it is there.\n\nSo move to (3,1) at t10, eat, score +1.\n\nSo in down path: eat at t5 and t10.\n\nIn left path: if I move L at t5, to (5,5) no eat\n\nt6 to (4,5) no eat\n\nt7 to (3,5) no eat\n\nt8 to (2,5) eat\n\nThen at t8, snake len 3: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen t9: from (2,5) move e.g. to (2,4) or other.\n\nBut (3,1) at t10, I am at (2,5) or (2,4), not close to (3,1), and with obstacles, I cannot reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) at t8, move D to (2,4) at t9\n\nThen at t9, from (2,4) move R to (3,4) at t9? t9 move to (3,4)\n\nThen at t10, from (3,4) move D to (3,3) but not to (3,1), so (3,1) not eaten.\n\nIf from (2,4) at t9, I move directly down but (2,3) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo I miss (3,1) in left path.\n\nTherefore, down path allows me to eat two foods: (6,4) and (3,1), while left path only (2,5).\n\nMoreover, in down path, after eating (3,1), I can go for (2,5) later, but (2,5) life span 9, available until turn 13, so possible.\n\nFor example, after t10 at (3,1), head at (3,1), direction say from moving down or left.\n\nThen I can move to (3,2), (3,3), etc., then to (4,5), (2,5), but (2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,3) to (3,4), to (4,4) or to (2,4) but (2,3) obstacle, so via (3,4) to (4,4), to (4,5), then to (3,5) or (5,5), but to (2,5) from (3,5) move L to (2,5), but (2,5) may have food or not, if not eaten.\n\nBut it's possible.\n\nBut for now, at turn 5, moving D to (6,4) seems better because I get immediate food and can get another.\n\nBut when I move to (6,4), I am at the bottom, and with obstacles, but I can navigate.\n\nMoreover, there is the food at (6,6), but I can't eat it safely.\n\nBut in the sequence, I don't need to.\n\nAnother point: if I move to (6,4) at t5, I eat, but then at t6 I must move down to (6,3), no choice, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen similarly down.\n\nBut at (6,2), I have a choice: move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf I move L to (5,2) at t8, for example.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go to (4,2), etc., but to reach (3,1), I need to go down.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (5,1) then to (4,1), to (3,1) at t10 or t11.\n\nBut (3,1) at t10, so if I go to (5,1) at t9, to (4,1) at t10, then to (3,1) at t11, missed.\n\nAt t8 from (6,2) move L to (5,2)\n\nt9 from (5,2) move D to (5,1)  (since U to (5,3) obstacle, etc.)\n\nt10 from (5,1) move L to (4,1) or directly to (3,1) not adjacent.\n\nTo (4,1) at t10, then t11 to (3,1), but (3,1) gone.\n\nIf from (5,1) at t10, I move to (4,1), but (3,1) not eaten.\n\nSo only by going directly down to (6,1) at t8, then to (5,1) at t9, to (4,1) at t10? From (6,1) to (5,1) at t9, then from (5,1) to (4,1) at t10, not to (3,1).\n\nAt t10 from (5,1) I can move to (4,1) or to (5,2), but not to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so to reach on t10, I need to be at (3,1) or adjacent at t9.\n\nIn down path, at t9, I am at (6,1) or (5,1), not adjacent to (3,1).\n\nFrom (6,2) at t8, if I move L to (5,2), then at t9 from (5,2) I can move L to (4,2) or D to (5,1).\n\nSay move L to (4,2) at t9, then at t10 from (4,2) move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1), etc., still not at (3,1).\n\nSo only by being at (4,1) at t9, I can move to (3,1) at t10.\n\nBut in down path, at t9, I am at (5,1) or (6,1), not (4,1).\n\nSo to eat (3,1) at t10, I need to be at (3,1) or adjacent at t9.\n\nFor example, at t9, if I am at (4,1) or (3,2) or (2,1) but (2,1) obstacle, so (3,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) can move to (3,1) directly.\n\n(3,2) can move to (3,1).\n\nIn the down path, how to be at (4,1) at t9.\n\nAt t5: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nt6: to (6,3)\n\nt7: to (6,2)\n\nt8: from (6,2) move L to (5,2)  // instead of down\n\nt9: from (5,2) move D to (5,1) or L to (4,2)\n\nIf move L to (4,2) at t9\n\nt10: from (4,2) move D to (4,1) or to (3,2), but to (3,1) not directly.\n\nFrom (4,2) move to (4,1) at t10, then not (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,2) move to (3,2) at t10, then from (3,2) I can move to (3,1) at t11, but t11 (3,1) gone.\n\nIf at t9 from (5,2) move D to (5,1), then t10 to (4,1), not (3,1).\n\nSo I cannot reach (3,1) on t10 from the down path; the earliest I can be at (3,1) is t11, but it's gone.\n\nAt t10, (3,1) is available, so if I am at (4,1) or (3,2) at t10, I can move to (3,1) on t10.\n\nFor example, at t10, from (4,1) move to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut to be at (4,1) at t10, I need to have moved there.\n\nIn down path with left turn:\n\nt5: to (6,4) eat\n\nt6: to (6,3)\n\nt7: to (6,2)\n\nt8: from (6,2) move L to (5,2)  // assume\n\nt9: from (5,2) move L to (4,2)  // not to (5,1)\n\nt10: from (4,2) move D to (4,1) or to (3,2)\n\nIf move to (4,1) at t10, then at t10 I can move to (3,1)? But at t10, I am at (4,2), I move to a new cell.\n\nAt the start of t10, I am at (4,2), then I choose to move to (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3) etc.\n\nIf I move to (4,1), I am at (4,1) at the end of t10, but to eat (3,1), I need to move to (3,1) during a turn.\n\nAt t10, if I move from (4,2) to (3,1), but (3,1) is not adjacent to (4,2); (4,2) to (3,1) is diagonal, not allowed, only up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (4,2), adjacent cells: (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2)\n\nSo to reach (3,1), I need to go to (3,2) first or (4,1).\n\nIf at t10 I move to (3,2), then at t11 to (3,1), but t11 (3,1) gone.\n\nIf at t10 I move to (4,1), then at t11 to (3,1), gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,1) if I am not close at t9.\n\nThe only way to eat (3,1) at t10 is to be at (3,2) or (4,1) or (2,1) but obstacle, so (3,2) or (4,1) at t9, then move to (3,1) at t10.\n\nIn the down path, at t9, I am at (5,2) or (6,1), not (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nSo impossible to eat (3,1) in the down path; I can only eat it if I am near earlier, but in this case, with the move sequence, I can't reach in time.\n\nIn the initial down move, at t5 I am at (6,4), then down to (6,3), (6,2), by t7 at (6,2), then at t8 if I move left to (5,2), at t8 at (5,2), then at t9 I can move to (4,2) or (5,1), not to (4,1) directly.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,2) at t9, then at t10 to (4,1) or (3,2), not (3,1).\n\nSo yes, I cannot eat (3,1) in down path.\n\nBut earlier I thought I could, but with the grid, it's not possible to reach on t10.\n\nIn my first down path, I had at t10 to (3,1) from (4,1), but to be at (4,1) at t10, I need to be there at the start of t10 or move to it.\n\nAt t9, I am at (5,1), for example, then at t10 move to (4,1), not to (3,1).\n\nSo I don't eat (3,1); I only eat (6,4) at t5.\n\nThen later I can eat (2,5) but it's far.\n\nIn down path, I only get one food.\n\nSimilarly, in left path, I get one food at t8.\n\nBut in left path, I can eat (2,5) at t8, and (2,5) is available.\n\nNow, for survival, both are ok.\n\nBut in down path, when I move to (6,4), I am near the wall, and with obstacles, I might have less space, but I can move left later.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut no more food, so score +1.\n\nIn left path, score +1 from (2,5).\n\nBut there is the food at (6,6), but I can't eat it.\n\nOr (6,4) is eaten in down path, but in left path, it is still there until turn 9, so if I go back, I can eat it.\n\nFor example, in left path, after eating (2,5) at t8, I can go back to (6,4), but it might take many turns, and with life span 5 at t5, available until t9, so at t8 and t9 it is there.\n\nAt t8 I am at (2,5), far from (6,4), so I cannot reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4), but at (6,5) to (6,4), but (6,5) may not be free.\n\nAt t8 after eating (2,5), snake at [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen t9 move to (3,5) or other, but to go right.\n\nSay move R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot move to body except tail.\n\nPositions: (2,5) head, (3,5) body, (4,5) tail.\n\nMove from (2,5) to e.g. (2,4) or (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nOnly can move to free cells or tail.\n\nSo from (2,5), move to (2,4) or (2,6) or (1,5), not to (3,5) which is body.\n\nThen to go to (6,4), I need to go via (3,4), but (2,3) obstacle, so from (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) but (5,4) obstacle, so to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4).\n\nMany turns, at least 6 moves from (2,5) to (6,4), so by t14, but (6,4) gone after t9, so impossible.\n\nSo in left path, I can only eat (2,5), not (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, in down path, I eat (6,4) and cannot eat (3,1), so only one food.\n\nBut in down path, I can eat (2,5) later, but it might be risky or take time.\n\nAt turn 5, moving to (6,4) gives me one food immediately, and I survive.\n\nMoving L to (5,5) gives no food now, but I can eat (2,5) later.\n\nBut both result in one food in the near term.\n\nHowever, moving to (6,4) has a risk: when I move to (6,4), the head is at (6,4), and the tail is at (5,5), but they are not adjacent; (6,4) and (5,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,4) and (5,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nPerhaps I should choose to move L to (5,5) to avoid the corner and have more space.\n\nThen I can eat (2,5) at t8.\n\nAnd for the sequence, I can output the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nSince the AI needs to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nLet's define the actions.\n\nTurn 5: I can move D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n\nMoving U is bad, as we saw.\n\nSo between D and L.\n\nIf I move D, I eat food but then go down.\n\nIf I move L, I go left to eat later.\n\nBut to maximize score, both give one food, but moving L might be safer for long-term.\n\nThere is food at (6,6), but I can't eat it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 5, move L to (5,5), no eat.\n\nThen turn 6 move L to (4,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 7 from (4,5) move D to (4,4) or U to (4,6), etc., but to go to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) available until t10, so I can reach it.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 7, move D to (4,4) at t7.\n\nThen t8 from (4,4) move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4), etc.\n\nTo (4,3) at t8.\n\nThen t9 to (4,2) or to (3,3), etc.\n\nTo (4,2) at t9.\n\nThen t10 to (4,1) or (3,2), but to (3,1), from (4,2) move to (3,2) at t10, then not to (3,1).\n\nOr from (4,1) to (3,1) at t10.\n\nBut to be at (4,1) at t10.\n\nFrom (4,5) at t7, move D to (4,4) at t7.\n\nt8 from (4,4) move D to (4,3) at t8.\n\nt9 from (4,3) move D to (4,2) at t9.\n\nt10 from (4,2) move D to (4,1) at t10 or to (3,2).\n\nIf to (4,1) at t10, then I can move to (3,1) at t11, gone.\n\nIf at t10 from (4,2) move to (3,2), then to (3,1) at t11, gone.\n\nSo cannot eat (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,5) at t7, move L to (3,5) at t7, then t8 to (2,5) eat, as before.\n\nThen same as left path.\n\nSo no way to eat both.\n\nTherefore, at turn 5, both choices lead to one food in the next 5 turns.\n\nBut moving D gets it earlier.\n\nAlso, moving to (6,4) might be riskier because of the wall, but I can escape left later.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), move L to (5,2), then I am in the center.\n\nSo I think moving D to (6,4) is fine.\n\nBut let's consider the direction.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (6,4), the head direction becomes D, and then I must move D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut in terms of survival, it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I should move L to have more flexibility.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (6,4) and (6,6); they are close, but I can only eat one, and (6,6) is not eatable.\n\nSo I think I'll go with moving D to eat the food.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the output should be for multiple turns.\n\nLet's define a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (6,4) eat food.\n\nThen turn 6: must move D to (6,3) not food.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,2) not food.\n\nTurn 8: from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2). To avoid dead end, move L to (5,2).\n\nTurn 9: from (5,2), move L to (4,2) or U to (5,3) but (5,3) obstacle, so only L to (4,2) or D to (5,1).\n\nSay move L to (4,2).\n\nTurn 10: from (4,2), move to (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the AI is to play, but for this response, I need to provide the actions for the current turn and future turns.\n\nThe format is to list for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide 5 actions or so.\n\nPerhaps for turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think moving D at turn 5 is acceptable.\n\nTo be safer, moving L might be better for long-term survival.\n\nBut in moving L, I can eat (2,5) at turn 8.\n\nAlso, the snake is shorter when moving, so less risk.\n\nAt length 2, moving to (5,5) is safe.\n\nThen at turn 6 to (4,5), etc.\n\nSo I'll go with moving left.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5), move L to (2,5) eat\n\nThen for turn 9, from (2,5), move e.g. D to (2,4) or other, but I don't need to specify beyond, but for the sequence, I can stop after a few turns.\n\nThe answer format should include actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nSo for turn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L ( to (3,5) )\n\nTurn 8: L ( to (2,5) eat )\n\nTurn 9: from (2,5), say move D to (2,4)\n\nBut at turn 9, it's future, I can choose.\n\nFor the response, I can provide up to turn 8 or so.\n\nSince turn 5 is given, output for turn 5 and the next few.\n\nI think for turn 5, move L.\n\nSo action at turn 5: L\n\nThen the sequence can be.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 5, if I move to (5,5), and the food at (6,4) and (6,6) are still there, but I leave them.\n\nBut I can't eat them later.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nI think I'll go with moving left for long-term.\n\nSo for turn 5: move L\n\nThen for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 5 to 9), thinking ahead to avoid risks and prioritize eating available food when safe. The snake starts at position (6,5) with direction R (right). After evaluating all options, moving left (L) to (5,5) at turn 5 is the safest choice, as it avoids the dead-end risks associated with moving up (U) to (6,6) or down (D) to (6,4). Moving U to (6,6) leads to immediate death on turn 6 due to no valid moves, and moving D to (6,4) traps the snake in the bottom-right corner with limited escape routes and no guarantee of eating additional food (e.g., (3,1) is unreachable by turn 10). Moving L opens a path to eat the food at (2,5) by turn 8, which has a long life span (available until turn 13), and allows for future exploration.\n\nThe planned sequence:\n- **Turn 5: Move L to (5,5)** – Avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to access the left side of the board. No food eaten, but the path to (2,5) is clear.\n- **Turn 6: Move L to (4,5)** – Continues leftward; no food at (4,5), but the snake shortens to length 2 (tail removed).\n- **Turn 7: Move L to (3,5)** – Moves closer to (2,5); no food eaten.\n- **Turn 8: Move L to (2,5)** – Eats positive food (+1 score), snake grows to length 3. The food at (2,5) is safely eaten as the head is not adjacent to the tail during consumption (tail is at (3,5), not directly adjacent to (2,5)).\n- **Turn 9: Move D to (2,4)** – After eating, move down to avoid obstacles and explore; no food at (2,4). This sets up potential to reach other areas or food later (e.g., (3,1) if time permits, though it may be tight by turn 10).\n\n### Key Reasoning:\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving U to (6,6) is fatal (no exits). Moving D to (6,4) risks trapping the snake and misses (3,1) due to distance and obstacles. Moving L ensures survival and access to open space.\n- **Food Prioritization**: (2,5) is targeted as it is reachable by turn 8 with high life span (turn 13 expiry). Other foods ((6,4), (6,6), (3,1)) are deprioritized: (6,4) and (6,6) are risky or inefficient to reach after turn 5, and (3,1) may not be eatable by turn 10 from this path but is less critical.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: By turn 9, the snake is at (2,4) with options to move to (1,4), (2,3) (obstacle, invalid), (3,4), or (2,5) (reverse, invalid). From there, it can navigate toward safer areas or other food (e.g., via (3,4) to explore down).\n- **Survival Focus**: The sequence avoids walls, obstacles (e.g., (5,4), (5,6) blocked), and body collisions. Growth is controlled to prevent entanglement.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 8 and positions the snake for potential future food while minimizing risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: L (left)  \nTurn 6: L (left)  \nTurn 7: L (left)  \nTurn 8: L (left)  \nTurn 9: D (down)\n}",
