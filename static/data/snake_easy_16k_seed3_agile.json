It's turn 0, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is just the head; no body segments.

After eating, the length increases by 1, so the next segment will be added when it moves.\n> \n> Movement: I can choose U, D, L, R, but since current direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R on the next turn. But since there's only one cell, I can move in any direction except possibly into walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid:\n> \n> - Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there. Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (3,4), (5,2), (2,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is directly above (3,3), since y increases up? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but in many games, y=0 is top or bottom. Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U is (x,y+1), that might imply y increases downward, but typically in coordinates, y=0 is top and y increases downward, or bottom and increases upward? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Movement: U: (x,y+1) — this suggests that y+1 is up, so y=0 might be the bottom row, and y increases as we go up? No: if U is up, and it's (x,y+1), that would mean y+1 is north, so if y=0 is south, y=7 is north, for example.\n> \n> But the grid borders are y=0 and y=7, with walls there. Similarly for x.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's define the grid:\n> \n> - x from 0 to 7, left to right.\n> \n> - y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Or top to bottom? Since U is (x,y+1), if y+1 increases the y-coordinate, and U is up, that suggests y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. For example, from (3,3), U to (3,4) would be up if y increases upward.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (x,y-1) would be down.\n> \n> L to (x-1,y) left, R to (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Also, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row (south wall), y=7 is top row (north wall).\n> \n> x=0 west, x=7 east.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), which is above y=0 but below the snake.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3), which is above (3,1) since y=3 > y=1.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,4): same x, y=4, so directly above snake at (3,3)\n> \n> - (5,2): x=5, y=2, so east and down from (3,3)\n> \n> - (2,5): x=2, y=5, so west and up from (3,3)\n> \n> Current direction is L, so snake was moving left to reach (3,3)? Positions are given as [(3,3)], and direction is L, meaning it's facing left, so it came from the right? Since it's a single cell, the direction might just be the last move or current facing. But since no body, it doesn't matter for collision, but for no instant reverse, I need to consider that I cannot move right immediately because that would be opposite to L.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So current direction is L, so I cannot move R on turn 0 action? Turn t1=0, I need to choose action for turn 0.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns starting from t1=0.\n> \n> So for turn 0, I choose an action, which will move the snake to a new position.\n> \n> Since snake is at (3,3), and I move, say, U to (3,4), but (3,4) has food? (3,4) is a food position.\n> \n> Food at (3,4), so if I move up to (3,4), I eat the food.\n> \n> But let's think carefully.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) — is this valid? (3,4) is within bounds, x=3, y=4 between 0 and 7, and not a wall. Walls are borders, so (3,4) is not a border cell since x=3 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacle is at (3,1), not (3,4). So (3,4) is free, but has food.\n> \n> Similarly, D: to (3,2) — y=2, not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> L: to (2,3) — x=2, y=3, not wall.\n> \n> R: to (4,3) — x=4, y=3, not wall.\n> \n> But current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) because that is opposite to left. So R is not allowed on this turn.\n> \n> So possible actions for turn 0: U, D, L. (not R)\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (3,4), I land on a food cell. Since it's positive food, I eat it, score +1, and snake grows. After eating, when the snake moves, a new segment is added where the tail was. But since there is no tail yet, let's think about growth.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list, currently [(3,3)], so head is at (3,3), no body.\n> \n> When I move to a new cell, if I eat food, I grow, so the new position list will have the new head position, and the previous position becomes the body.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the head moves to the food cell, and since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. But when the snake is just born, with one cell, moving to food should make it two cells.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Start: snake at S, positions [S]\n> \n> - Move to new cell N: if no food, snake moves to [N], but since it was one cell, it's still one cell at N? No.\n> \n> In snake, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so length stays same unless food eaten.\n> \n> But if no body, moving to empty cell: head moves to new position, and since no tail, it's still one cell.\n> \n> If moving to food cell: head moves to food, eats it, so tail doesn't move, so the previous position becomes the new tail segment, so now snake has two segments.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> Turn t: snake at [(3,3)]\n> \n> Action: move to (3,4), which has food.\n> \n> After move: head at (3,4), and since food eaten, the segment (3,3) becomes the body, so positions now [(3,4), (3,3)]\n> \n> Length increased to 2.\n> \n> If no food, move to (3,4) no food, then positions become [(3,4)], still length 1.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,4) has food.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions. Currently no body, so only walls and obstacles to worry about.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,1), which is not adjacent to (3,3), so all adjacent cells are free except possibly borders, but (3,3) is not on border.\n> \n> (3,3): adjacent cells:\n> \n> - (3,4) up: free, has food\n> \n> - (3,2) down: free, no food? Food is at (3,4), (5,2), (2,5), so (3,2) no food\n> \n> - (2,3) left: free, no food\n> \n> - (4,3) right: but cannot move right due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> (4,3) is east, and current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So for turn 0, actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, U to (3,4): eat food, grow to length 2, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3)\n> \n> D to (3,2): no food, snake still at [(3,2)] length 1\n> \n> L to (2,3): no food, snake at [(2,3)] length 1\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food life span: all food has life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten, including the current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> But if eaten on turn when countdown is 1, it should be eaten before disappearing? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, then after eating or after turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, for example, food with life span 10 at turn t: on turn t, countdown is 10, it can be eaten on turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, countdown becomes 9, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears.\n> \n> If eaten on a turn, it's removed.\n> \n> Now, in this case, all food has life span 10 at turn 0, so they will be around for 10 turns.\n> \n> But since the grid is small, and snake short, I can plan to eat multiple.\n> \n> Now, the special case: food under body. But currently no body, so no issue.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but only if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But no tail now.\n> \n> So for now, safe.\n> \n> But after eating, there will be a body.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat the positive food.\n> \n> But need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (3,4) immediately: turn 0 action U.\n> \n> Then snake at (3,4) and (3,3), length 2, head at (3,4), direction would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> After moving, the direction is set to the move direction.\n> \n> So head direction becomes U.\n> \n> Now, from there, I can plan next moves.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, I can go for other food.\n> \n> List all food: (3,4) is close, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up, (5,2) is right and down.\n> \n> (5,2) is east and south.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), moving L to (2,3) gets me closer to (2,5).\n> \n> Moving D to (3,2) gets me closer to (5,2)? (5,2) is at x=5,y=2, so from (3,2), it's east.\n> \n> But (3,2) to (5,2) is two steps right.\n> \n> Similarly, from (3,3) to (2,5): (2,5) is x=2,y=5, so from (3,3) to (2,3) is left, then to (2,4) up, then to (2,5) up, so three steps if I go directly.\n> \n> But with body, it might be different.\n> \n> Since I need to think long-term, let's consider options for turn 0.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n> \n> - Turn 0: move U to (3,4), eat food, snake now: head (3,4), body (3,3), length 2, head direction U.\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to D immediately?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible actions step-by-step to determine the best immediate move at Turn \\( t_0 = 2 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (3,5), body at (3,4). Length = 2.\n- **Head Direction**: Up (U). Last move was upward to (3,5).\n- **Possible Moves**: U, L, R (cannot reverse to D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value +1, life span 8 (available until Turn 9).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 8 (available until Turn 9).\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 9 (available until Turn 10).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move U to (3,6)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,6). Snake grows to length 3: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].\n   - Next moves: From (3,6), can only move L or R (U is wall, D is body).\n   - Risk: Trapped at the top edge with limited mobility.\n\n2. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - Eat food at (2,5). Snake grows to length 3: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n   - Next moves: From (2,5), can move U, D, or L (R is body).\n   - Advantage: Central position, more flexibility for future moves.\n\n3. **Move R to (4,5)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake remains length 2: [(4,5), (3,5)].\n   - Next moves: From (4,5), can move U, D, or R (L is body).\n   - Advantage: Keeps snake short, avoids immediate edge risks.\n\n### Long-Term Considerations:\n- **Eating (3,6) first** risks trapping the snake at the top edge, making it harder to reach other food later.\n- **Eating (2,5) first** is safer, as it's centrally located and allows more maneuverability to reach (5,2) and (3,6) later.\n- **Not eating immediately** (moving R to (4,5)) delays growth but preserves flexibility. However, it may miss the opportunity to eat (3,6) later due to distance.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Action:\nThe best balance between immediate reward and long-term survival is to **eat the centrally located food at (2,5)**. This grows the snake while keeping it in a flexible position to navigate toward other food later.\n\n### Action Sequence (Example):\n1. **Turn 2**: Move L to (2,5) (eat).\n2. **Turn 3**: Move D to (2,4).\n3. **Turn 4**: Move D to (2,3).\n4. **Turn 5**: Move D to (2,2).\n5. **Turn 6**: Move R to (3,2).\n6. Continue toward (5,2) to eat by Turn 9, then navigate to (3,6) if possible.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 2 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 5), (3, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (5, 2, 8, 1)\n\t- (2, 5, 8, 1)\n\t- (3, 6, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 2 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I have to consider the internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), and the body is at (3,4). Since it's a list with head first, and only two segments, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Since current turn is 2, it will disappear after 8 more turns? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N means it will be there for N turns, disappearing after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food at (5,2): life_span = 8 at turn 2. That means it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Or after N turns from now? I think it's better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 2, life_span=8, meaning after this turn (turn 2), countdown becomes 7, and so on, until countdown=0, it disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn when countdown would be 0? Or after the turn?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is given at current turn. So for food at turn t with life_span N, it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, disappearing before turn t + N.\n> \n> Example: at turn 2, life_span=8. After turn 2, countdown=7; after turn 3, countdown=6; ... after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n> \n> - Start of turn 2: countdown=8, food present.\n> \n> - After turn 2 action: countdown decreases to 7.\n> \n> - Start of turn 3: countdown=7, food present.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - Start of turn 9: countdown=1, food present.\n> \n> - After turn 9: countdown decreases to 0, food disappears before turn 10.\n> \n> So food is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, where N is initial life_span at turn t.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> - (5,2): value=1, life_span=8 at turn 2, so available turns 2 to 9 (8 turns)\n> \n> - (2,5): value=1, life_span=8 at turn 2, available turns 2 to 9\n> \n> - (3,6): value=1, life_span=9 at turn 2, available turns 2 to 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food.

Body at (3,4), so tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction, so since head direction is U, I cannot move D next. So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid:\n> \n> - Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food at: (5,2), (2,5), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,6) is directly above the head, since head at (3,5), and U would be to (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) has food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food, snake length increases to 3, new head at (3,6), tail was at (3,4), but after eating, tail stays until next move? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after moving to food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, new tail segment is added, so snake grows by one, and tail position remains until next move.\n> \n> But here, since we move, if head moves to food, it eats it, length increases, and the body segments follow.\n> \n> Specifically for this case: current positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), which has food, so I eat it. New positions: head to (3,6), body: previous head (3,5) becomes body, and since I ate, I add a new segment at the tail? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you move, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position. If you eat food, after moving, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start: snake positions: S0 (head), S1, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> If head moves to a food cell, then after the move, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail extends, and length increases.\n> \n> In this case, positions list: after move, new head position, then S0, then S1, ..., then Sk (tail), and if ate, add a new segment at Sk, so positions become [new_head, S0, S1, ..., Sk, Sk]?

No, all segments move.\n> \n> After moving direction D:\n> \n> - New head: position based on move\n> \n> - Then the previous head position becomes the new position for the first body segment\n> \n> - The previous first body position becomes the new position for the second body segment, and so on\n> \n> - The tail segment moves to the position of the previous segment before it.\n> \n> Since we have a list, after move, the new positions are: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, old_B2, ..., old_second_last], and the old tail is removed only if no growth; if growth, we keep the old tail and add a new segment there? No.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Simpler: when the snake moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail segment does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, the snake moves, head to new position, each segment to the next, and tail is removed from the old position.\n> \n> In terms of positions list:\n> \n> Let positions = [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 is head, Pk is tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q:\n> \n> - New head is Q\n> \n> - New body segments: P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}  # each shifts down\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the tail Pk is removed, so new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]\n> \n> - If food eaten, then the tail stays, and we add a new segment at Pk, so new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk]  # Pk is now the second last, and new tail is Pk, but since we add, positions become [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk] with length k+2? Let's index.\n> \n> Original: k+1 segments: indices 0 to k.\n> \n> After move and eat: new head Q, then the previous positions: P0 (now body), P1, ..., Pk (now body), and since ate, we add a new segment at the current tail position before move, which is Pk, so new segment at Pk.\n> \n> But Pk is still there, so positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk] with the new segment at Pk, so Pk is now part of the body, and the new tail is still Pk? No, we add a new segment at the same position as Pk, so now we have two segments at Pk? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: when the snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: after move, new head position, then the old head position, then the old body positions except the tail is not removed; instead, it remains, so the new positions include all old positions plus the new head, minus nothing.\n> \n> Example: current positions: [H, B]\n> \n> H is head, B is body/tail since only two segments.\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q:\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [Q, H]  # B is removed, tail moves to H?

Since current turn is 2, it will disappear after 8 more turns? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N means it will be there for N turns, disappearing after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food at (5,2): life_span = 8 at turn 2. That means it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Or after N turns from now? I think it's better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 2, life_span=8, meaning after this turn (turn 2), countdown becomes 7, and so on, until countdown=0, it disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn when countdown would be 0? Or after the turn?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is given at current turn. So for food at turn t with life_span N, it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, disappearing before turn t + N.\n> \n> Example: at turn 2, life_span=8. After turn 2, countdown=7; after turn 3, countdown=6; ... after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n> \n> - Start of turn 2: countdown=8, food present.\n> \n> - After turn 2 action: countdown decreases to 7.\n> \n> - Start of turn 3: countdown=7, food present.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - Start of turn 9: countdown=1, food present.\n> \n> - After turn 9: countdown decreases to 0, food disappears before turn 10.\n> \n> So food is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, where N is initial life_span at turn t.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> - (5,2): value=1, life_span=8 at turn 2, so available turns 2 to 9 (8 turns)\n> \n> - (2,5): value=1, life_span=8 at turn 2, available turns 2 to 9\n> \n> - (3,6): value=1, life_span=9 at turn 2, available turns 2 to 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction U, so last move was up to (3,5). Body at (3,4), so tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction, so since head direction is U, I cannot move D next. So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid:\n> \n> - Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food at: (5,2), (2,5), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,6) is directly above the head, since head at (3,5), and U would be to (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) has food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food, snake length increases to 3, new head at (3,6), tail was at (3,4), but after eating, tail stays until next move? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so after moving to food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, new tail segment is added, so snake grows by one, and tail position remains until next move.\n> \n> But here, since we move, if head moves to food, it eats it, length increases, and the body segments follow.\n> \n> Specifically for this case: current positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), which has food, so I eat it. New positions: head to (3,6), body: previous head (3,5) becomes body, and since I ate, I add a new segment at the tail? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you move, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position. If you eat food, after moving, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start: snake positions: S0 (head), S1, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> If head moves to a food cell, then after the move, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail extends, and length increases.\n> \n> In this case, positions list: after move, new head position, then S0, then S1, ..., then Sk (tail), and if ate, add a new segment at Sk, so positions become [new_head, S0, S1, ..., Sk, Sk]? No.\n> \n> Standard: positions are stored as list of coordinates.\n> \n> Before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head, B1 is first body, T is tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head position, then H becomes new B1, B1 becomes new B2, ..., up to T, which is discarded? No, all segments move.\n> \n> After moving direction D:\n> \n> - New head: position based on move\n> \n> - Then the previous head position becomes the new position for the first body segment\n> \n> - The previous first body position becomes the new position for the second body segment, and so on\n> \n> - The tail segment moves to the position of the previous segment before it.\n> \n> Since we have a list, after move, the new positions are: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, old_B2, ..., old_second_last], and the old tail is removed only if no growth; if growth, we keep the old tail and add a new segment there? No.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Simpler: when the snake moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail segment does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, the snake moves, head to new position, each segment to the next, and tail is removed from the old position.\n> \n> In terms of positions list:\n> \n> Let positions = [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 is head, Pk is tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q:\n> \n> - New head is Q\n> \n> - New body segments: P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}  # each shifts down\n> \n> - If no food eaten, the tail Pk is removed, so new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]\n> \n> - If food eaten, then the tail stays, and we add a new segment at Pk, so new positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk]  # Pk is now the second last, and new tail is Pk, but since we add, positions become [Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk] with length k+2? Let's index.\n> \n> Original: k+1 segments: indices 0 to k.\n> \n> After move and eat: new head Q, then the previous positions: P0 (now body), P1, ..., Pk (now body), and since ate, we add a new segment at the current tail position before move, which is Pk, so new segment at Pk.\n> \n> But Pk is still there, so positions: [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk] with the new segment at Pk, so Pk is now part of the body, and the new tail is still Pk? No, we add a new segment at the same position as Pk, so now we have two segments at Pk? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: when the snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: after move, new head position, then the old head position, then the old body positions except the tail is not removed; instead, it remains, so the new positions include all old positions plus the new head, minus nothing.\n> \n> Example: current positions: [H, B]\n> \n> H is head, B is body/tail since only two segments.\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q:\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [Q, H]  # B is removed, tail moves to H? No.\n> \n> After move, head moves to Q, then the body moves to H. Since only one body segment, it moves to the old head position H. The old tail position B is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [Q, H]\n> \n> Length same.\n> \n> If move to food at Q, then after head moves to Q, body moves to H, and since ate, a new segment is added at the old tail position B. So new positions: [Q, H, B]\n> \n> Now length 3.\n> \n> In this case, tail was B, new tail is B.\n> \n> In positions, [Q, H, B] with Q head, H body, B tail.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Similarly, if longer snake.\n> \n> Back to this: current positions [(3,5), (3,4)] so H=(3,5), B=(3,4)\n> \n> If move U to (3,6), which has food, so new head (3,6), body: old head (3,5), and since ate, add new segment at old tail (3,4), so new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> Length 3.\n> \n> If no food, new positions [(3,6), (3,5)] and (3,4) vacated.\n> \n> But here, (3,6) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,6) has life_span 9 at turn 2, so it will be there until after turn 10 or something, but since I eat it at turn 2, it should be consumed.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> What does that mean?\n> \n> \" If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (3,5), tail is at (3,4). Are they adjacent? Yes, vertically adjacent.\n> \n> The tail cell (3,4) does not have food; food is at (3,6), not at tail.\n> \n> The tail cell is (3,4), no food there. Food is elsewhere.\n> \n> The condition is: if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food, then if you eat that food by moving to it, it causes collision.\n> \n> But here, I'm not moving to the tail cell; I'm moving to (3,6), which is different.\n> \n> The tail cell (3,4) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving U to (3,6) should be fine, I eat the food, grow to length 3.\n> \n> But let's see the position: (3,6) is within bounds? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable since y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? Borders x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall. So the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.

It's turn 4, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,5), then body at (2,5), and tail at (3,5). So the snake is three segments long, moving left. Head direction is L, which means last move was left to (1,5) from (2,5)? Let's see: positions are [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)], and head direction is L. Since it's moving left, the head was at (2,5) before moving to (1,5), so the body segments follow.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,2) with life span 6, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 4, for (5,2), life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 more turns? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn, including the current one. So for food at (5,2), life span 6 at turn 4 means it will disappear at turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the current turn, life_span is given, and it decreases each turn. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears. So for (5,2) at turn 4, life_span=6, so after turn 4, life_span becomes 5, and so on, until it reaches 0 at turn 10 (since 4 + 6 = 10, but after turn 10, it's gone).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) at turn 4, life_span=7, disappears after 7 turns, so at turn 4+7=11.\n> \n> (5,4) life_span=10, disappears at turn 14.\n> \n> But I need to think about when I can eat them.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,5), moving left. From direction L, possible moves: since I can't reverse instantly, I can't go right (R). So possible moves from (1,5) are: up (U) to (1,6), down (D) to (1,4), or left (L) to (0,5). But x=0 is a wall, so moving left to (0,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (0,5) is a wall, can't go there.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's not near me now.\n> \n> So from (1,5), with head direction L, I can move:\n> \n> - U: (1,6)\n> \n> - D: (1,4)\n> \n> - L: (0,5) but invalid, wall\n> \n> - R: but reverse, not allowed since last move was L, so I can't go R immediately.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or D.\n> \n> Moving to (1,6) or (1,4).\n> \n> Now, (1,6): is it safe? y=6, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within bounds, not a wall. Similarly, (1,4) is y=4, fine.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake: head (1,5), body (2,5), tail (3,5). So it's horizontal at y=5, from x=1 to x=3.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,2) - bottom right-ish\n> \n> - (3,6) - above the tail, since tail is at (3,5), so (3,6) is directly above tail.\n> \n> - (5,4) - right, down a bit.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so eating any grows the snake by one.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (5,2) life 6, (3,6) life 7, (5,4) life 10. So (5,2) disappears soonest, at turn 10, then (3,6) at 11, (5,4) at 14.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence starting from turn t1=4, for a few turns, and a thinking conclusion.\n> \n> It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves.\n> \n> Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current position: head at (1,5). Possible moves: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (1,6), what happens?\n> \n> New head position (1,6), body moves: the segment at (1,5) becomes body, (2,5) becomes body, (3,5) is tail, which will move away if I move, but when I move, the tail moves only if I don't eat food.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, tail moves forward, so the cell (3,5) is freed.\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (1,6), I don't eat food, so snake becomes: head (1,6), then (1,5), then (2,5). Tail was at (3,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves to where the second last segment was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, if not eating, tail leaves the last cell.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (1,6), then previous head (1,5) becomes neck, then (2,5) becomes body, and tail (3,5) is removed, so new positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Similarly, if I go D to (1,4), new positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to think about getting to food.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (3,6). That's directly above the current tail position (3,5). So (3,6) is one cell up from (3,5).\n> \n> But the tail is at (3,5), and if I move, the tail might move away.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (3,6), not on the tail. The tail is at (3,5), no food there.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is on a different cell.\n> \n> The danger is if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Let me read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, the food must be on the tail cell, and head adjacent to tail, and if head moves to that cell to eat, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the food, which was tail, so now the head is where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the body is there, and head collides with body.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,6), it's not on the tail. Tail is at (3,5), food at (3,6).\n> \n> So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, to reach (3,6): from current position (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), then I'm at (1,6). From there, I can go right to (2,6), then to (3,6), but that might take a few turns.\n> \n> From (1,6) to (3,6): I need to go east to x=3.\n> \n> But at (1,6), I can go R to (2,6), then R to (3,6)? (3,6) is food.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, from (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Head at (1,6), direction U? Last move was U, so direction now U.\n> \n> Then from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid; D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body, so collision; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6) possible.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (2,6).\n> \n> After moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5). Tail (2,5) was left, but since no eat, tail moved away, so body is (1,6), and (1,5) is now tail? Positions: after move to (2,6), the segments are: head (2,6), previous head (1,6) now body, and previous body (1,5) now tail, so [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n> \n> From (2,6), I can go to (3,6), which is food.\n> \n> Move R to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, at (3,6), there is food, so I eat it.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows: head at (3,6), then previous positions: (2,6) and (1,6), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so new segment added, positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]? Let's see: when head moves to food, the tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Original before move: head (2,6), body (1,6), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Move head to (3,6), which has food, so new head (3,6), then body (2,6), (1,6), and tail (1,5) remains, so positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Head at (3,6), tail at (1,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> But earlier, the food was at (3,6), and life span 7 at turn 4, so at turn 6 or something? Let's track turns.\n> \n> Start turn 4: at (1,5), move U to (1,6). Turn 4 action U.\n> \n> After move, turn 5 begins? The state is given at turn t1=4, and I need to choose action for turn 4.\n> \n> After action, the turn increments.\n> \n> So at turn 4, I perform action, then state updates for turn 5.\n> \n> But in the sequence, I need to output actions starting from turn 4.\n> \n> Now, back to plan.\n> \n> If I go U at turn 4 to (1,6).\n> \n> Then at turn 5, from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6), as I thought.\n> \n> Then at turn 6, from (2,6), I can go R to (3,6) and eat food.\n> \n> So in two moves, I can eat (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) has life span 7 at turn 4. At turn 4, life span 7, so after turn 4, it decreases to 6? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At the start of turn 4, life span is given as 7 for (3,6).\n> \n> After turn 4, when I move, the life span decreases? The countdown decreases every turn, including when the turn is processed.\n> \n> Typically, at the beginning of the turn, before action, the state is as given, including food life spans.\n> \n> After I perform action, the turn ends, life spans decrease, and if life span 0, food disappears.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 4 start, food at (3,6) has life span 7.\n> \n> I perform action, say move to (1,6), no eat, so after action, turn ends, life span decreases to 6 for all food.\n> \n> Then turn 5 begins.\n> \n> Similarly, after turn 5 action, life span decreases to 5, and so on.\n> \n> For (3,6), at turn 4: life 7\n> \n> After turn 4: life 6 (if not eaten)\n> \n> After turn 5: life 5\n> \n> After turn 6: life 4, etc.\n> \n> It disappears when life span reaches 0 after decrease.\n> \n> If life span N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning at turn t+N it might be gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t action, life span becomes N-1. If N-1=0, it disappears; else, continues.\n> \n> So for (3,6) at turn 4, life 7: after turn 4, life 6; after turn 5, life 5; ... after turn 10, life 1; after turn 11 action, life 0, disappears. So available until turn 10 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, food has life span L.\n> \n> If not eaten during turn t, after the turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So food is present during turn t if life span > 0 at start of turn.\n> \n> For (3,6) at turn 4: life 7 >0, present.\n> \n> If not eaten on turn 4, after turn 4, life becomes 6.\n> \n> Turn 5: life 6 >0, present.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 10: at start, life span = 7 - (10-4) = 3? Better to compute remaining.\n> \n> At turn t, life span given is L.\n> \n> After k turns, life span is L - k.\n> \n> Food disappears when after decrease, life span <=0.\n> \n> Specifically, at turn t, if life span L, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves to it.\n> \n> Then after turn t, if not eaten, life span decreases to L-1.\n> \n> If L-1 >=1, still present; if L-1=0, disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,6) L=7 at turn 4:\n> \n> - Can be eaten on turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10? On turn 10, life span at start: initial L=7, after (10-4) =6 decreases? From turn 4 to turn 10 is 7 turns? Turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10: that's 7 actions.\n> \n> At turn 4: before action, life span 7\n> \n> After turn 4 action (if not eaten), life span 6\n> \n> After turn 5, life 5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 10 action, life span 7 - 7 =0, disappears, so not present on turn 11.\n> \n> It can be eaten on any turn from 4 to 10 inclusive, since on turn 10, life span at start is 7 - (10-4) = 7-6=1 >0, so present, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn 10, life becomes 0, gone.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Back to (3,6): I can eat it by turn 6, as I thought, with sequence U at turn 4, R at turn 5, then at turn 6 R to (3,6) and eat.\n> \n> At turn 6, it will be eaten.\n> \n> Life span at turn 4:7, so on turn 6, before action, life span = 7 - (6-4) = 7-2=5? From turn 4 to turn 6: after turn 4, life 6; turn 5 start life 6, after turn 5, life 5; turn 6 start life 5, so I can eat on turn 6 with life 5 left, fine.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake grows to length 4.\n> \n> But I need to think beyond.\n> \n> Another food: (5,2) and (5,4).\n> \n> (5,2) has shorter life, only 6 at turn 4, so disappears after turn 9?

After eating at turn 6, positions as above.\n> \n> Turn 6 action: moved to (3,6) and ate, so after that, turn 7 begins with head at (3,6).\n> \n> At turn 7, from (3,6), I can go R to (4,6) or D to (3,5).\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), tail (1,6) or? Positions: before move, head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Move head to (4,6), no food there, so new head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), and tail (1,6) since (1,5) was tail, but no eat, tail moves, so the segment (1,5) is removed, and (1,6) becomes new tail? Standard: the last segment is removed, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] and tail was (1,6)? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: segments: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: tail (1,5)\n> \n> Move head to (4,6), no food, so new head (4,6), then body: previous head (3,6), previous body (2,6), and the last segment (1,6) is kept, but since tail moves, the segment (1,5) is removed, so new positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), and (1,6) becomes the tail? Positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] since (1,5) is gone, and (1,6) is now part of body? After moving to (4,6), the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed, so segments become: new head (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), and (1,6) is no longer part of snake because tail moved. Since no food eaten, snake length same, so only three segments: head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (2,6)? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Initial before move: snake positions [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] with head at (3,6), tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Move head to (4,6), no food at (4,6), so the tail is removed. The new head is (4,6), and the body is the previous head and body except the last segment is removed. So the segments: previous head (3,6) becomes first body, previous first body (2,6) becomes second body, previous second body (1,6) becomes tail, and (1,5) is removed. So new positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]? No: when tail moves, the last cell is vacated, so the snake shortens by removing the tail segment.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (4,6), the snake consists of: new head (4,6), then the previous segments from head to the one before tail: previous head (3,6) is now body, previous body (2,6) is now body, and previous body (1,6) is now tail, and (1,5) is no longer part of snake. Since the snake had 4 segments, after moving without eating, it has 3 segments: head, and the first two body segments become the new body and tail.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, when it moves without eating, new head at new position, then the first L-1 segments of the previous positions become the body, so length L.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: tail (1,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6), new positions: new head (4,6), then previous index 0: (3,6), previous index 1: (2,6), and previous index 2: (1,6) becomes the new tail. Previous index 3: (1,5) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] but that's four segments, but I didn't eat, so length should be same, 4? After eating at turn 6, length became 4, so moving without eating, length should remain 4, but the tail moves.\n> \n> In the new positions, it's [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] with head at (4,6), tail at (1,6).\n> \n> Yes, the tail moved from (1,5) to (1,6)? No, the cell (1,6) was already occupied, but when the snake moves, the tail leaves (1,5), so (1,5) is free, and the head moves to (4,6), so the body shifts, so (1,6) is still part of the body, but in the new order, (1,6) is the third segment, tail.\n> \n> Positions are (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — all at different cells, (1,6) is tail.\n> \n> (1,5) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had gone D to (3,5), etc.\n> \n> But back to planning.\n> \n> I have two choices at turn 4: U or D.\n> \n> If I go U, I can quickly eat (3,6) by turn 6.\n> \n> If I go D, to (1,4), then I can go towards the other food.\n> \n> But (3,6) is closer and has medium life span, while (5,2) has shorter life.\n> \n> (5,2) life span 6 at turn 4, so must eat by turn 9.\n> \n> From current position, to reach (5,2), it's at (5,2), I'm at (1,5), so Δx=4, Δy=3, so at least 7 moves away, but with obstacles.\n> \n> For example, from (1,5) go D to (1,4), then R to (2,4), then R to (3,4), but (3,4) is free? Obstacle at (3,1), not (3,4), so (3,4) ok, then to (4,4), (5,4), but (5,4) has food, but I need to go to (5,2), so from (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2).\n> \n> But (5,4) has food, I might eat it on the way.\n> \n> But let's see the turns.\n> \n> At turn 4, if I go D to (1,4).\n> \n> Then positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Head at (1,4), direction D.\n> \n> Then at turn 5, I can go R to (2,4) or D to (1,3).\n> \n> If I go R to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (1,4), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Then at turn 6, from (2,4), I can go R to (3,4), U to (2,5) but (2,5) is tail?

Head direction is U.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move Down this turn.\n> \n> Available moves: U, L, R. But I need to check if these are valid, considering walls, obstacles, and self-collision except for the tail.\n> \n> Self-collision: If head moves to a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away. But in this case, the tail is at (2,5), and head is at (1,6). Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,7). But y=7 is a wall, so moving Up to (1,7) would hit the wall, die.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,6). x=0 is wall, so hit wall, die.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,6). Is (2,6) safe? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5). So (2,6) is not occupied by snake body. Also, no wall at (2,6) since walls are at borders and (3,1). (2,6) is within bounds: x=2, y=6, both between 0 and 7, not (3,1). So moving Right to (2,6) should be safe.\n> \n> But is there food? I need to think about food later. First, for immediate move, only Right is possible? Up and Left lead to death, so only Right is viable this turn.\n> \n> Confirm:\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) - y=7 is border wall, so collision, die.\n> \n> - Left: (0,6) - x=0 border wall, collision, die.\n> \n> - Down: But cannot, because opposite direction. Current head direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> - Right: (2,6) - not wall, not occupied by body except tail? Tail is at (2,5), which is different cell. (2,6) is empty, I assume.\n> \n> Snake positions are only (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), so (2,6) is free. Also, no obstacle there.\n> \n> So for turn 5, I must move Right to (2,6). No choice, otherwise I die immediately.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence. I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> After moving to (2,6), the snake will be: head at (2,6), then body at (1,6), and tail at (1,5). When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward or stays if food eaten, but no food eaten yet.\n> \n> In this move to (2,6), is there food? Food positions: (5,2), (3,6), (5,4). (2,6) is not a food position, so no food eaten. So snake grows only when eating positive food.\n> \n> After move: head at (2,6), then the previous head (1,6) becomes body, and body (1,5) becomes tail, and tail (2,5) is removed? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Initial positions: turn 5, snake: [ (1,6), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n> \n> After moving Right to (2,6):\n> \n> - New head: (2,6)\n> \n> - Then the body: previous head (1,6) becomes first body segment.\n> \n> - Then previous body (1,5) becomes second body segment? Let's list the segments.\n> \n> Positions: head was at index 0, body at index 1, tail at index 2.\n> \n> After move: new head at (2,6), then the segment that was head (1,6) is now body, and the segment that was body (1,5) is now tail. The previous tail (2,5) is no longer part of snake, so it's free.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n> \n> Head direction: I moved Right, so new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, for turn 6, I need to choose move.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction R, I can move R, U, or D, not L (opposite).\n> \n> Available cells:\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,6)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,7)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,5)\n> \n> Now, check safety:\n> \n> - (3,6): is it safe? Walls: x=3,y=6. Not border wall (borders are x=0,7 y=0,7), internal obstacle at (3,1), which is different. So (3,6) should be free. Snake positions: current [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ], so (3,6) not occupied. But there is food at (3,6)? Food: (3,6) is a food position? Food positions: (5,2), (3,6), (5,4). Yes, (3,6) has food with value +1, life span 6.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 5, life span was 6, so at turn 6, it decreases to 5? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn when it appears? The state is at turn 5, so for food at (3,6), life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 turns from when it appeared, but we don't know when it appeared. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn t, if life span is L, after one turn it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 5, life span for (3,6) is 6, so it has 6 turns left including turn 5? The description says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> In state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3,6,6,1)\" at turn 5.\n> \n> Life span 6 means at turn 5, it has 6 turns left? Or including current turn?\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for example, if food spawns at turn S with life span N, then at turn S, life span N, at S+1, N-1, ..., at S+N-1, 1, and at S+N, it disappears.\n> \n> Here, at turn 5, life span is 6, so it was spawned at some turn such that at turn 5, it has 6 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 10? Let's see.\n> \n> If at turn T, life span is L, then it has L turns including T, so it will be gone at turn T+L.\n> \n> At turn T, countdown is L, after T, it decreases to L-1 at T+1, and so on, until 0 at turn T+L-1, and gone at turn T+L? But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, meaning that during turn T, it is present, and after the turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn, the life span is the number of full turns it will remain, including the current turn.\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 6 at turn 5: it will be present on turns 5,6,7,8,9,10, and disappear at turn 11. So it has 6 turns of life left starting from turn 5.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life span 5 at turn 5: present turns 5 to 9, gone at turn 10.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 9 at turn 5: present turns 5 to 13, gone at turn 14.\n> \n> Now back to possible moves at turn 6.\n> \n> After turn 5 move to (2,6), head at (2,6), direction R.\n> \n> Turn 6 moves:\n> \n> - R to (3,6): which has food! (3,6) has positive food.\n> \n> - U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, die.\n> \n> - D to (2,5): (2,5) is currently the tail position? Current snake positions after turn 5: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] so (2,5) is free now, since tail moved from (2,5) to? After moving to (2,6), the tail was at (1,5)? Positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), tail (1,5). So (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> Moving Down to (2,5): (2,5) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied, so safe, but no food there.\n> \n> If I move to (3,6), I eat the food there.\n> \n> Eating food: since it's positive, value +1, snake grows by one segment. So if I eat at (3,6), new head at (3,6), and the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]? When eating, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added, so the tail stays.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, head moves to food, new body segment added where the tail was, but tail doesn't move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n> \n> Move head to (3,6), eat food, so new head (3,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, (1,6) becomes body, and (1,5) remains tail, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance, so a new segment is effectively added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the segment before tail becomes the new tail, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves one step, but if it eats food, instead of removing the tail, the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> So before move: segments: 0: (2,6) head, 1: (1,6), 2: (1,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6) and eating: new head at (3,6), then segment 0 becomes (3,6), segment 1 is the previous head (2,6), segment 2 is previous segment 1 (1,6), and a new segment 3 is added at the previous tail position (1,5)? But (1,5) was the tail, and it stays, so positions become [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ].\n> \n> Yes, so snake grows, and (1,5) is still part of snake, but now it's not the tail? Let's index: new head at (3,6), then body: (2,6), then (1,6), then tail (1,5). So the tail is still (1,5), but it was already there, and a new segment is added, so the segment that was tail becomes the second last, and new tail is added? No.\n> \n> In terms of movement: when eating, the head moves to new cell, the body segments shift, but the tail is not removed, so the last body segment stays, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before movement? I think I need to clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, head to new position, each segment moves to previous, but tail is not removed, so the vacated position is not vacated, and a new segment is created at the old tail position? But that might not be accurate.\n> \n> Perhaps it's simpler: after eating, the snake length increases, and the new position is added at the tail end, but the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> So in this case, before move, snake positions: A = head (2,6), B = (1,6), C = tail (1,5)\n> \n> After moving to (3,6) and eating: new head at (3,6), then B moves to where A was? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow the head. So when head moves to (3,6), segment B moves to (2,6) which was the head position, and segment C moves to (1,6) which was B's position. But since we ate food, we don't remove the tail, so C was at (1,5), and it moves to (1,6), but (1,5) is vacated? But when eating, we add a new segment, so the tail should stay.\n> \n> I think the common way is: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not advance, meaning that the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added behind it? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps: the movement is the same, but when food is eaten, instead of popping the tail, we keep it, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> But the tail end doesn't move when eating.\n> \n> For example, from positions [head, body, tail], after moving to a new cell without eating, it becomes [new head, previous head, previous body] and tail is removed.\n> \n> With eating: [new head, previous head, previous body, previous tail] and previous tail stays as part of snake.\n> \n> So in this case, from [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] move to (3,6) eat: new positions [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] so the tail is still (1,5), but now it's the last segment, and the snake has 4 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if no eat, move to (3,6) no food, then [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) ] and (1,5) vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,6) has food, so with eat, snake becomes [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n> \n> Tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Now, back to turn 6 choices.\n> \n> At turn 6, head at (2,6), direction R.\n> \n> Move R to (3,6): eat food, grow to 4 segments.\n> \n> Move U to (2,7): wall, die.\n> \n> Move D to (2,5): no food, snake moves to [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] and (1,5) vacated, so length 3 still.\n> \n> But moving D to (2,5) is possible, but (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> However, if I move to (3,6), I eat food and grow, which is good for score.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 6, before move, head at (2,6), tail at (1,5). Are they adjacent? (2,6) and (1,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; adjacent means same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1, so diagonal is not adjacent. So (2,6) and (1,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (2,6) adjacent cells: (2,7), (2,5), (1,6), (3,6).\n> \n> Tail is at (1,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6); (1,5) is down-left, not direct adjacent.\n> \n> So no danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (3,6) to eat food is safe and beneficial.\n> \n> Then, after eating, head at (3,6), direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Now, for turn 7, I need to choose next move.\n> \n> But let's list the sequence turn by turn.\n> \n> First, for turn 5: I must move R to (2,6), as only safe move.\n> \n> Then turn 6: I can move R to (3,6) to eat food.\n> \n> Then turn 7: head at (3,6), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: R to (4,6), U to (3,7), D to (3,5), not L (opposite).\n> \n> U to (3,7): y=7 wall, die.\n> \n> D to (3,5): possible, no food known.\n> \n> R to (4,6): possible.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (5,2), (3,6) but (3,6) was eaten, so removed. Food at (5,2) life span 5 at turn 5, so at turn 6 it has life span 4? Let's track food life.\n> \n> At turn 5: food (5,2) life 5, (3,6) life 6, (5,4) life 9.\n> \n> After turn 5: no food eaten, so at turn 6, food: (5,2) life 4, (3,6) life 5, (5,4) life 8. Life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> (3,6) was eaten at turn 6? Turn 6 move, when I move to (3,6), I eat it during turn 6.\n> \n> The state is before the move, so at the start of turn 6, (3,6) has life span 5 (since at turn 5 it was 6, after turn 5, life span decreases to 5 at turn 6? Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t1=5, before the move.\n> \n> When I make a move on turn t, after the move, the turn increments, and food life span decreases.\n> \n> For food life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> In the context, \"current turn\" might mean the turn when the state is described.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to assume that at the beginning of each turn, before action, the food is present with its current life span.\n> \n> Then, when the snake moves, if it moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> After the move, for all food, life span decreases by 1, and if it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for the next turn.\n> \n> In the state at turn 5, life span is given, so for (3,6), life span 6, meaning at turn 5, it has life span 6, so after turn 5 action, it decreases to 5 at turn 6, and so on.\n> \n> When the snake moves to a food cell during a turn, it eats it immediately upon moving there.\n> \n> So for turn 6: at start, food (3,6) has life span 5 (decreased from 6 at turn 5).\n> \n> If I move to (3,6), I eat it, so it is consumed and removed.\n> \n> Then after move, for other food, life span decreases.\n> \n> Similarly for turn 7.\n> \n> But let's proceed.\n> \n> For turn 6, I decide to move R to (3,6) to eat food.\n> \n> Then after turn 6, snake: [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] head at (3,6), direction R.\n> \n> Food (3,6) eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Other food: (5,2) had life span 5 at turn 5, after turn 5 it became 4 at turn 6, but since we are after turn 6 action, after move, life span decreases for remaining food.\n> \n> At turn 6 start, before action: (5,2) life span 4 (after decrease from turn 5), (3,6) life span 5, (5,4) life span 8.\n> \n> (3,6) is eaten during turn 6 action, so removed.\n> \n> After turn 6 action, for remaining food, life span decreases: (5,2) from 4 to 3, (5,4) from 8 to 7.\n> \n> Now turn 7: head at (3,6), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: R to (4,6), U to (3,7), D to (3,5).\n> \n> U to (3,7): wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (3,5): free cell?

When L-1 = 0 after some turn, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L. After the turn (after actions), the life span decreases by 1. So if L decreases to 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 4 at turn 6: during turn 6, it's there. After turn 6, life span becomes 3. After turn 7, becomes 2. After turn 8, becomes 1. After turn 9, becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see: at turn 6, life span 4, present. Turn 7, life span 3, present. Turn 8, life span 2, present. Turn 9, life span 1, present. After turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 10. So it can be eaten on turns 6,7,8,9.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,6): life span 5 at turn 6, so present turns 6 to 10, disappears before turn 11.\n> \n> (5,4): life span 8, present turns 6 to 13, disappears before turn 14.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,6), moving right (direction R). So from (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) immediately. So possible moves: U (up, to (2,7)? y+1 is up, I assume? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up or down? The movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So for head at (2,6), moving R (right) to (3,6) would be continuing right, but (3,6) is a food position? Food is at (3,6), yes.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is present.\n> \n> Now, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,6) is inside. Moving R to (3,6): x=3, y=6, which is within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant here.\n> \n> Snake body: positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]. So head at (2,6), body at (1,6), tail at (1,5).\n> \n> If I move R to (3,6), that is a food position. So I would eat the food, increase length by 1, score +1.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks. Also, the tail is at (1,5), not adjacent to head directly.\n> \n> Head is at (2,6), possible adjacent cells: (2,7) up, (2,5) down, (1,6) left, (3,6) right.\n> \n> (1,6) is the body segment, so moving left to (1,6) would be body collision, deadly. So cannot move L.\n> \n> (2,7): y=7 is the top wall, since y=7 is border, so moving up to (2,7) would be wall collision, deadly. So cannot move U.\n> \n> (2,5): down, to (2,5), is that free? Current snake positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (2,5) is not occupied, I think. Let's list all occupied cells: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (2,5) is empty? But is it within bounds? x=2, y=5, between 0 and 7, yes. No wall there except borders, and y=5 not wall. Walls are only at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,5) is safe.\n> \n> (3,6) is food, and not occupied by snake, so moving there is possible.\n> \n> But (3,6) is food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake grows, so positions become: new head at (3,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (1,6) body, then (1,5) tail. Since I ate food, length increases, so after move, snake is [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving, head moves to new position, and if no food eaten, tail moves off, so length same. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail.\n> \n> Here, moving to (3,6) which has food, so eat it, so head moves to (3,6), body: (2,6) becomes segment, then (1,6), then tail (1,5) stays, so positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]. Length 4 now.\n> \n> But (1,5) is still there, and (1,6) is body.\n> \n> Now, current direction was R, so after moving R, direction is still R for next move.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (1,5), head at (2,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,5) and (2,6) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (1,5) and (2,6) are not adjacent; (1,5) is left-down from (2,6), not directly adjacent. Direct adjacent would be (2,5), (2,7), (1,6), (3,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is body, not tail. Tail is (1,5), which is not adjacent to head (2,6). Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; only if |dx| + |dy| =1.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, other food: (5,2) and (5,4).\n> \n> (5,2) is at bottom, life span 4, so need to eat soon.\n> \n> (5,4) has longer life.\n> \n> But I should consider paths.\n> \n> Since I'm at (2,6), and (3,6) has food, I can eat it immediately.\n> \n> But let's see the grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), but that's far from current position.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,6), body (1,6), tail (1,5). So the snake is in the top-right area, y=6 and y=5.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,6) at same y, x=3\n> \n> - (5,2) at x=5,y=2, bottom\n> \n> - (5,4) at x=5,y=4, middle\n> \n> After eating (3,6), snake head at (3,6), with body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5).\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (3,5), down.\n> \n> L to (2,6), but (2,6) is now body segment, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> R to (4,6), right.\n> \n> So can go D or R.\n> \n> If go R to (4,6), that's empty, I assume. No food there.\n> \n> Then positions: head to (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), tail (1,5) moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves off (1,5), so new positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)]? After eating at (3,6), snake is [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]. Then when moving to (4,6), no food, so head to (4,6), then body: (3,6), (2,6), and tail (1,6) since (1,5) is left, tail moves to (1,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: positions list: after eating at turn t, positions: [head new, previous head, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move to food at (3,6): positions [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n> \n> Now, next move, say to (4,6), no food there. So head moves to (4,6), then the body segments follow: (3,6) becomes new body part, (2,6) next, and tail (1,6) because (1,5) is no longer part of snake; the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment. Since no growth, the tail end is removed.\n> \n> So positions become: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] and (1,6) is the new tail, but (1,5) is vacated.\n> \n> List: before move, positions: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: tail (1,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6), new head (4,6), then segment 1: (3,6), segment 2: (2,6), and since no growth, segment 3 is removed, so tail is at (1,6)? The positions shift: new position 0: (4,6), position 1: old position 0 which is (3,6), position 2: old position 1 which is (2,6), and old position 2 (1,6) becomes the tail, so positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)], length 3 again? No, after eating, length increased to 4, but when moving without eating, it shrinks back? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I confuse.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows. So after eating, length is increased permanently until another eat or something, but in snake, when you eat, you grow by one segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> At state: positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] length 3.\n> \n> Move to (3,6) which has food: head moves to (3,6), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] length 4.\n> \n> Now, next move, if move to (4,6), no food, then head moves to (4,6), and tail moves off, so the last segment (1,5) is removed, and the new positions are [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] and (1,6) is still there? Positions: new head (4,6), then previous head (3,6) is first body, then (2,6) is second body, and (1,6) is tail. Since tail moved, (1,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] length 3? But (1,6) was body, now it is tail. In the list, after move to (4,6), positions should be [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] with (1,6) no longer part of snake? I'm messing up.\n> \n> Standard way: the positions list is the sequence from head to tail.\n> \n> Before move: positions P = [H, B1, T] for length 3, but here [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] so H=(2,6), B1=(1,6), T=(1,5)\n> \n> After moving H to new position, if no eat, T is removed, and new positions [new H, old H, B1] so [new, (2,6), (1,6)] with T removed.\n> \n> If eat, T not removed, new positions [new H, old H, B1, T]\n> \n> In this case, after eat at (3,6): new positions [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n> \n> Now, for next move, from (3,6) to say (4,6), no food, so head moves to (4,6), then new positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] and the tail (1,5) is removed, so (1,6) becomes the new tail? Positions: new head (4,6), then previous positions: (3,6) is first body, (2,6) is second body, and since tail moved, (1,6) is no longer part of snake; the last segment (1,5) was tail, but it was removed, so the segment before that, (1,6), is now the tail, but in the list, it's [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] with (1,6) gone? No.\n> \n> Let's index the positions.\n> \n> At time t after move: positions: index 0: head (3,6), index 1: (2,6), index 2: (1,6), index 3: tail (1,5)\n> \n> When moving to new head position, say (4,6), no food, so new head is (4,6), then the body segments become: the previous head becomes new body 1, previous body 1 becomes new body 2, and so on, but the tail is removed, so the last segment (index 3) is removed. So new positions: new head (4,6), then index 1: previous head (3,6), index 2: previous body 1 (2,6), and previous body 2 (1,6) becomes new tail. So positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] with (1,6) as tail? [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] and the tail is (2,6)? No, (2,6) is the last in the list, so tail at (2,6), but that was body, and (1,6) is gone.\n> \n> Positions list: after move, it's [new head, previous index 0, previous index 1, ..., but without the last if no growth.\n> \n> General rule: when moving to a cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> - If food, head moves to new cell, body segments stay, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail.\n> \n> In list terms:\n> \n> Let P = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] of length L.\n> \n> After moving head to new position N:\n> \n> - If no food at N, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., second last], so length L, tail is the previous B_{L-2} or something.\n> \n> For example, L=3: P = [H, B, T]\n> \n> Move to N, no food: new P = [N, H, B] and T is removed, so new tail is B.\n> \n> In this case, B was body, now tail.\n> \n> With numbers:\n> \n> Before move: P = [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]  head (3,6), body (2,6), body (1,6), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Move to (4,6), no food: new head (4,6), then new body1: old head (3,6), new body2: old body1 (2,6), and the tail (1,5) is removed, so old body2 (1,6) is not included? Positions become: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) ] and the segment (1,6) is no longer part of the snake; it was removed when the tail moved, but (1,6) was a body segment, not tail. In the list, the last segment is tail, so when tail moves, the last position is vacated, and the new positions are the new head and all previous positions except the tail is gone, so the second last becomes the new tail.\n> \n> In P = [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> After move to N, no food: new P = [N, A, B, C] so new head N, new body A, new body B, new tail C.

So head is (5,5), which is below (5,6), so it moved down to (5,5) from (5,6)? But (5,6) is the second segment, so the head was at (5,6) before moving down to (5,5)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The positions are listed head first: index 0 is head, so at turn 10, head is at (5,5). Previous head was at (5,6), I assume, since it moved down.

It's turn 11, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall corner, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,1). So the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), except (3,1) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake has 5 segments. Head is at (5,4), and direction is D, which is down, meaning it moved down to (5,4) from previous position. Since positions are head first, and previous head was (5,5) I assume, but let's see the list: positions are [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. Head at (5,4), and it came from (5,5) since direction is D, so it moved down to (5,4) from (5,5). But (5,5) is the first body segment, so the head was at (5,5) before moving down to (5,4). Direction D means current heading is down, so last move was down.\n> \n> Head direction is given as \"D\", which is the current direction the head is facing after moving to (5,4). So from turn 10 to 11, it moved down to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,2), life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn 11, food at (4,2) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 16 (11+5? Let's think: if countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 11, life span 6, so after 6 turns it will be gone. So it exists from turn 11 to turn 16? Countdown: at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0 at turn t+L-1? Better to calculate the last turn it exists.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, it disappears after L turns, meaning it is present for L more turns including current. So at turn t, it has L turns left, including turn t. So it will be gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 11, life span 6, so it will be gone at turn 11 + 6 = turn 17? But countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So if at turn t, life span N, then at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, countdown 1, and at turn t+N, it disappears, so it's not present at turn t+N.\n> \n> Therefore, food is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (4,2): life span 6 at turn 11, so present from turn 11 to turn 16 (11 + 6 - 1 = 16).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): life span 9 at turn 11, present from turn 11 to 19 (11 + 9 - 1 = 19).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc., but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

So tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Direction: head direction D (down), so it just moved down to (5,4), meaning it was at (5,5) before.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,4): since direction is D, it can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up).

Currently, at turn 11, (5,3) is not occupied by snake or wall. Snake is at (5,4),(5,5),(5,6), etc., so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) should be free, and (5,1) has food.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at y=1, which is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is playable, as long as not obstacle.\n> \n> (3,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) is not, so it should be fine.\n> \n> Life span: (5,1) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, there's another food at (4,2) with life span 6, so only 6 turns including this one, so it will disappear after turn 16.\n> \n> Turn 11 to 16 present.\n> \n> If I go directly to (5,1), from (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1), that's three moves, so at turn 14, I can eat it if I move down.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, at turn 11, I can move D to (5,3).\n> \n> Then turn 12, from (5,3), direction would be D, I can move D to (5,2).\n> \n> Then turn 13, from (5,2), move D to (5,1), eat food, snake grows to 6 segments.\n> \n> But after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately, but when I move onto the food, I eat it, so length increases, and tail stays until next move? No.\n> \n> Rule: when head moves onto food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the new segment is added at the head, but the tail doesn't move that turn? I need to clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when the head moves to a new cell, if it's food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; if not, tail moves one step.\n> \n> But in this description, it says: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And movement: each turn, head moves to adjacent cell, and if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows; else, tail moves to follow.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So in this case, if I move to (5,1) on turn 13, I eat the food, so snake grows, positions: head at (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)?

Now, head to (5,2), which was free? (5,2) is not occupied, so ok. Then after move, tail (4,6) moves off? Since no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> When moving to a cell without food, tail moves off.\n> \n> So on turn 14, move to (5,2), no food there, so tail moves: new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (5,6) moves off, so body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) and tail (5,6) is gone, new tail is (5,5)? Positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ] since (5,6) was tail, it moved off, so length 5, but we had length 6 after eating, so when no eat, length same.\n> \n> Before turn 14: positions [(4,2), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)] with (4,6) is not there?

Eating it would increase the snake's length to 6.\n   - The tail would stay at (5, 6) since the snake grows.\n   - New head direction: D.\n2. **L (Left)**: Move to (3, 3)\n   - No food here. The tail would move forward to (5, 5).\n   - New head direction: L.\n3. **R (Right)**: Move to (5, 3)\n   - No food here. The tail would move forward to (5, 5).\n   - New head direction: R.\n- **U (Up)**: Not allowed (opposite of current direction D).\n\n### Considerations:\n1. **Food at (4, 2)**:\n   - Life span = 4, so it will disappear after Turn 16. Eating it now is safe and maximizes the chance to collect it.\n   - Moving down to (4, 2) is the only way to eat it immediately.\n2. **Food at (4, 3)**:\n   - Cannot be eaten now because the head is already on it. We must move away and return later to eat it.\n3. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - Life span = 7, so it will be available until Turn 19. We can plan to eat it later.\n4. **Risks**:\n   - Moving down to (4, 2) is safe (no collision with body or walls).\n   - Moving left or right is also safe but does not collect food immediately.\n\n### Decision:\n- The best immediate action is to **move down to (4, 2)** to eat the positive food (+1) before it disappears. This maximizes the score and does not pose any immediate risk.\n\n### Action Sequence (for Turns 13-17):\n1. **Turn 13**: D (eat food at (4, 2))\n2. **Turn 14**: D (move to (4, 1))\n3. **Turn 15**: R (move to (5, 1), eat food at (5, 1))\n4. **Turn 16**: U (move to (5, 2))\n5. **Turn 17**: U (move to (5, 3))\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1), but since direction is D, moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so last move was down to (4,3). From the positions: from (4,4) to (4,3), that is down, yes.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (4,3) is the current head position. But food can be under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Here, (4,3) has food with life span 10. But the snake head is already on it? No, the head is at (4,3), and there's food at (4,3). But according to the rules, if food is under the snake, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and then head moves back. But the head is currently on it? That might be a conflict.\n> \n> Let me read the special cases: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But here, the head is on (4,3), and there's food at (4,3). If the head is on it, can it be eaten immediately? The rule says the head must move onto it, but it's already on it. I think in this case, since the head is on the cell, it might be considered for eating, but the rule specifies that for food under the body, it needs the body to move away first. But here it's under the head.\n> \n> I need to clarify. The food at (4,3) is listed, and the snake head is at (4,3). So, at this turn, since the head is on a food cell, it should be eaten, right? But the rule about food under body might imply that it's not eaten immediately if under body segments, but for head, it should be different.\n> \n> Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" – body includes head? Typically, head is part of the snake, so \"body\" might refer to all segments.\n> \n> But in collision, head touching body is deadly, so head is separate.\n> \n> Perhaps I should assume that if the head is on a food cell at the start of the turn, it can be eaten immediately, unless specified otherwise.\n> \n> But here, the food at (4,3) has life span 10, and it's turn 13, so it spawned earlier and is still there, and snake moved onto it.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions\", and (4,3) is listed, and snake head is at (4,3), so I think at the beginning of turn 13, the head is on the food, so it should be eaten this turn.\n> \n> But let's see the rule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" – which happens when the snake moves to that cell. In this case, the snake just moved to (4,3) in the previous turn, I assume.\n> \n> Turn t1=13 is the current turn, so we are about to make a move for turn 13. The state is given at the start of turn 13.\n> \n> At the start of turn 13, snake head is at (4,3), and there is food at (4,3). Since the head is on it, when we process this turn, before moving, the food should be eaten if possible.\n> \n> But the special case says for food under body, it needs body to move away first. Here it's under head, so it should be eatable immediately.\n> \n> I think there might be confusion.\n> \n> Let me assume that at the start of the turn, if the head is on a food cell, it is eaten during that turn, before moving or after? Typically in Snake, when you move to a cell with food, you eat it.\n> \n> But here, since the head is already on it at start of turn, it might have been eaten in the previous turn.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t1=13, with positions and food. So for food at (4,3), it is present, and head is on it, so when the snake was moved to (4,3) in turn 12, it should have eaten the food then. But the food is still listed with life span 10, so it wasn't eaten.\n> \n> Perhaps the food was spawned under the snake, and since the snake was on it, it wasn't eaten until the snake moves away and back.\n> \n> I think I need to follow the rule strictly.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For the head cell, if food is there and head is on it, it can be eaten only if the head moves onto it, which implies that it wasn't eaten when spawned under, but when the head leaves and comes back.\n> \n> In this case, at start of turn 13, head is on (4,3) with food, but since it didn't \"move onto\" it this turn, it might not be eaten yet. The move happened in previous turn.\n> \n> I'm getting confused.\n> \n> To simplify, let's assume that for food to be eaten, the head must move to that cell during a move action. If the head is on a food cell at start, it was not necessarily eaten; it depends on when it moved there.\n> \n> But in standard Snake, when you move to a cell, you eat the food there.\n> \n> Here, since food can be under body, it's different.\n> \n> For this specific case, food at (4,3) is under the head at start of turn 13. Since the head moved to (4,3) in turn 12, it should have been eaten in turn 12. But the food is still listed with life span 10, so it wasn't eaten, meaning that when food spawns under the snake, it is not eaten immediately; it must be accessed later by moving away and back.\n> \n> Similarly for other body parts.\n> \n> So for (4,3), the food is there, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves off and then back on.\n> \n> That makes sense with the rule.\n> \n> So at turn 13 start, food at (4,3) is present but not eaten because the head is on it, but it didn't \"move onto\" it this turn; it was already there from previous move.\n> \n> The eating happens when the head moves to a cell with food during the move.\n> \n> So for turn 13, when we choose a move, if we move to a cell with food, we eat it, but if we stay, we don't eat.\n> \n> But in Snake, you don't stay; you always move to an adjacent cell.\n> \n> So at each turn, you move to a new cell; if that cell has food, you eat it.\n> \n> If the cell had food but you were on it, you don't eat it by staying; you have to move to it from another cell.\n> \n> So for (4,3), at turn 13 start, the head is on it, so it is not eaten; if we move away and then back later, we can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,2) and (5,1) are not under snake, so they can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (4,2), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 13, life span 4, so after turn 13, it will have 3 left, and so on, disappearing after turn 16? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns from now, meaning at the end of turn t1 + N - 1 or something?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, for a food with life span L, the countdown is L at start of turn t.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears, I assume at the end of the turn or beginning of next.\n> \n> But for eating, if you move to it when countdown >0, you eat it.\n> \n> For (4,2), life span 4 at turn 13, so:\n> \n> - Turn 13: countdown 4\n> \n> - After turn 13, countdown 3\n> \n> - After turn 14, countdown 2\n> \n> - After turn 15, countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 16, countdown 0, so it disappears, meaning not available from turn 17 onwards. So it can be eaten in turns 13 to 16 inclusive? Let's see.\n> \n> At start of turn t, countdown is C.\n> \n> During turn t, if head moves to it, it is eaten.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown decreases to C-1.\n> \n> If countdown was 1 at start of turn, after turn it becomes 0, and food disappears.\n> \n> So food with countdown C at start of turn can be eaten that turn if head moves to it, and after that, countdown decreases.\n> \n> For (4,2), at turn 13, countdown=4, so it can be eaten in turn 13,14,15,16. After turn 16, countdown=0, gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 7, can be eaten turns 13 to 19.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10, turns 13 to 22.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (4,3), adjacent cells: up (4,4), down (4,2), left (3,3), right (5,3).\n> \n> But walls: border walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,2) is y=2, which is above y=0, so within bounds, y=0 is wall, so y=2 is valid? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are free? No.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? But positions: snake has (5,6), y=6, and y=7 is wall, so y=6 is not wall, similarly x=4,5, etc.\n> \n> Typically, for a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so inner cells (1,1) to (6,6) are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).

Must ensure future moves don't trap the snake.\n\n2. **Move L to (3,2)**:\n   - Positions after move: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n   - Next steps: Need to navigate around the internal obstacle at (3,1) to reach (5,1), which may take too long (food disappears at turn 19).\n   - Risk: May not reach (5,1) in time.\n\n3. **Move R to (5,2)**:\n   - Positions after move: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n   - Next step: Can move D to (5,1) at turn 15 to eat the food at (5,1).\n   - Risk: Similar to moving D first, but the body configuration is slightly more compact.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (5,1) has a short life span (must be eaten by turn 19), so we should prioritize reaching it.\n- Moving **R to (5,2)** is better than moving D to (4,1) because:\n  - It keeps the snake's body away from the bottom wall, reducing the risk of trapping.\n  - The path to (5,1) is straightforward (move D at turn 15).\n  - The body configuration after eating is more manageable for future moves.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 14-15):\n1. **Turn 14**: Move R to (5,2).\n   - New positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n2. **Turn 15**: Move D to (5,1) to eat the food.\n   - New positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)] (snake grows to length 7).\n\n### Future Considerations:\n- After eating at (5,1), plan to free the food at (4,3) by moving the snake's body away from it over time.\n- Avoid trapping the snake by moving into open space (e.g., right or up after turn 15).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Also, an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders and one internal wall at (3,1).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (4,2), and it's moving down (direction D), which means from (4,3) to (4,2) since head is first and moving down would decrease y? Let me clarify the direction.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as D, which is down. But in the positions, head is at (4,2), and the next segment is (4,3). If head is at (4,2) and moving down, down means decreasing y? In standard coordinates, y often increases upwards, but in grids, it might vary. I need to check the movement definition.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x. So y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, y=7 top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n> \n> Head at (4,2), and direction is D (down, which is decreasing y). But from the positions, the previous head position must have been (4,3) since it moved down to (4,2). Let's see the sequence: positions are head first, so at turn 14, head is (4,2), body segments: (4,3), (4,4), etc. Since it was moving down to get to (4,2), the previous head was (4,3) at turn 13, and it moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (4,3) is also a body segment of the snake. Specifically, it's the second segment in the list: positions are [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), ...] so (4,3) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, which is the case here. Food at (4,3) is under the snake body. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Life span: food at (5,1) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn. So at turn 14, it has 6 turns left; it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 14 + 5 more turns, life span decreases each turn).\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is 6 at turn 14, after turn 14, it has 5 left, after turn 15, 4 left, ..., after turn 19, it has 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 19 inclusive? At turn 19, if head moves to it before it disappears, it can be eaten. But the countdown decreases at the end of the turn or beginning? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, food is present during the turn, and if head moves to it during the turn, it's eaten. Life span decreases after the turn or before?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn, if food has life span L, it is present during that turn. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 6 at turn 14: during turn 14, it is present, and can be eaten if head moves to it. After turn 14, life span decreases to 5. Similarly, at turn 19, if life span is 1, it can be eaten during turn 19, and after that, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food at (4,3) with life span 9: present from turn 14 to turn 22 inclusive? Turn 14: life span 9, after turn 14: 8, ..., after turn 22: 0, disappear. So can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 22.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction down (D). Possible moves: from current position and direction, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move U on the next turn because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> Current direction D, so I cannot move U next. Possible moves: D, L, R. But I have to consider walls and body.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - U (up): (x,y+1) = (4,3)\n> \n> - D (down): (x,y-1) = (4,1)\n> \n> - L (left): (x-1,y) = (3,2)\n> \n> - R (right): (x+1,y) = (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - U to (4,3): what is at (4,3)? It's a body segment, the second position. But according to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed because the tail will move, but only if it's the tail cell specifically? Let's see the collision rule.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, the tail segment is the last one in the positions list. Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)] so head is (4,2), tail is (5,6).\n> \n> If I move to a body segment that is not the tail, it's a collision. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because after moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving to (4,3) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other body segments would be bad.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) has food under it, but since it's occupied by body, I cannot eat it now; I need to move away first.\n> \n> But for movement, if I try to move U to (4,3), it's a body cell, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, U is invalid.\n> \n> D to (4,1): is this within bounds? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is y=1, which is not wall, since y=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 are free? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free except obstacles. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (4,1) is not that.\n> \n> (4,1) is empty? Let's see if any snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), etc., not (4,1). Walls: y=0 is wall, but (4,1) has y=1, not 0, so should be free.

I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current state:\n> \n> - Turn: 14\n> \n> - Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,1). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders and one internal wall at (3,1).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (4,2), and it's moving down (direction D), which means from (4,3) to (4,2) since head is first and moving down would decrease y? Let me clarify the direction.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as D, which is down. But in the positions, head is at (4,2), and the next segment is (4,3). If head is at (4,2) and moving down, down means decreasing y? In standard coordinates, y often increases upwards, but in grids, it might vary. I need to check the movement definition.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x. So y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, y=7 top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n> \n> Head at (4,2), and direction is D (down, which is decreasing y). But from the positions, the previous head position must have been (4,3) since it moved down to (4,2). Let's see the sequence: positions are head first, so at turn 14, head is (4,2), body segments: (4,3), (4,4), etc. Since it was moving down to get to (4,2), the previous head was (4,3) at turn 13, and it moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (4,3) is also a body segment of the snake. Specifically, it's the second segment in the list: positions are [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), ...] so (4,3) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, which is the case here. Food at (4,3) is under the snake body. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Life span: food at (5,1) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn. So at turn 14, it has 6 turns left; it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 14 + 5 more turns, life span decreases each turn).\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is 6 at turn 14, after turn 14, it has 5 left, after turn 15, 4 left, ..., after turn 19, it has 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 19 inclusive? At turn 19, if head moves to it before it disappears, it can be eaten. But the countdown decreases at the end of the turn or beginning? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, food is present during the turn, and if head moves to it during the turn, it's eaten. Life span decreases after the turn or before?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn, if food has life span L, it is present during that turn. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 6 at turn 14: during turn 14, it is present, and can be eaten if head moves to it. After turn 14, life span decreases to 5. Similarly, at turn 19, if life span is 1, it can be eaten during turn 19, and after that, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food at (4,3) with life span 9: present from turn 14 to turn 22 inclusive? Turn 14: life span 9, after turn 14: 8, ..., after turn 22: 0, disappear. So can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 22.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction down (D). Possible moves: from current position and direction, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move U on the next turn because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> Current direction D, so I cannot move U next. Possible moves: D, L, R. But I have to consider walls and body.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - U (up): (x,y+1) = (4,3)\n> \n> - D (down): (x,y-1) = (4,1)\n> \n> - L (left): (x-1,y) = (3,2)\n> \n> - R (right): (x+1,y) = (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - U to (4,3): what is at (4,3)? It's a body segment, the second position. But according to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed because the tail will move, but only if it's the tail cell specifically? Let's see the collision rule.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, the tail segment is the last one in the positions list. Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)] so head is (4,2), tail is (5,6).\n> \n> If I move to a body segment that is not the tail, it's a collision. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because after moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving to (4,3) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other body segments would be bad.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) has food under it, but since it's occupied by body, I cannot eat it now; I need to move away first.\n> \n> But for movement, if I try to move U to (4,3), it's a body cell, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, U is invalid.\n> \n> D to (4,1): is this within bounds? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is y=1, which is not wall, since y=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 are free? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free except obstacles. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (4,1) is not that.\n> \n> (4,1) is empty? Let's see if any snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), etc., not (4,1). Walls: y=0 is wall, but (4,1) has y=1, not 0, so should be free. Internal obstacle only at (3,1), not (4,1).\n> \n> So (4,1) should be free. But is it a wall? Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly, internal at (3,1).\n> \n> So for (4,1): x=4 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7? y=1 is not y=0, so not border wall. And not (3,1), so free.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,2): x=3,y=2. Not border wall. Internal obstacle at (3,1), but (3,2) is different, so should be free.\n> \n> R to (5,2): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> But we need to check if these cells are occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2) is head, (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So (3,2) not in list, (4,1) not, (5,2) not. So all three moves D, L, R are potentially valid, but U is invalid due to body collision.\n> \n> Also, no wall collision.\n> \n> But current direction is D, so moving D is allowed, L and R are also allowed since not opposite.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food and plan ahead.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value +1, life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 19.\n> \n> - (4,3) with value +1, life span 9, must be eaten by turn 22.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently under snake body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,3), then head can move to it later.\n> \n> Currently, at (4,3) is the second segment. When the snake moves, depending on the move, the body segments follow.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (5,6), and head is at (4,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,2) and (5,6) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |4| = 5, so far.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 14.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n> \n> I should consider the consequences of each.\n> \n> Also, the food at (5,1) is close; it's at (5,1), which is one step right and one down from head? Head at (4,2), so (5,1) is down-right, but not directly adjacent; from (4,2), (5,1) is R then D or D then R, etc.\n> \n> To reach (5,1) from (4,2), I can go R to (5,2) then D to (5,1), or D to (4,1) then R to (5,1), etc.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) is above, but occupied.\n> \n> Now, life span: (5,1) has only 6 turns left, so I should consider eating it soon, but not necessarily immediately if risky.\n> \n> (4,3) has longer life span, 9 turns.\n> \n> But to eat (4,3), I need to vacate that cell first.\n> \n> Currently, (4,3) is occupied by body. When the snake moves, if I move away from it, the body might stay or move.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 14, head moves to a new position, and all body segments follow.\n> \n> If I move head to a new cell, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, and the cell that was body might shift.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,3): it is currently the second segment. If I move the head, say, down to (4,1), then new head is (4,1), body segments: the old head (4,2) becomes first body segment, then (4,3) becomes second, but positions: new positions after move.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then body: (4,2) [which was head], (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,5) since (5,6) was tail, but tail moves, so (5,6) is vacated, and the segment that was at (4,3) is now at index 2 or something.\n> \n> List positions after move down to (4,1):\n> \n> Current positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (5,6)\n> \n> After moving head down to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - New body segments: the previous positions from head to one before tail: so (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> - The tail (5,6) is left, so new positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> (5,5) is now the tail, and (4,3) is still occupied by body.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (3,2):\n> \n> New positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Tail (5,6) gone.\n> \n> If move right to (5,2):\n> \n> New positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> In all cases, (4,3) is still occupied because it was not the tail; the tail was at (5,6).\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,3) moves away, which will happen over time as the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, if I keep moving, eventually the body at (4,3) will move to another position when the snake turns or something.\n> \n> But it might take a few turns.\n> \n> Since (4,3) is close to head, I could move in a way to free it soon.\n> \n> Another thing: after moving, the food at (4,3) is still under the body, so I can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food at (5,1).\n> \n> It's at (5,1), and life span 6, so I have until turn 19 to eat it.\n> \n> From head (4,2), I can go directly to it in two moves: e.g., R then D, or D then R.\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (3,1), which might block some paths.\n> \n> Now, I should think about the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at borders and (3,1) obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly vertical from (4,2) to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then up to (5,6)?

It's turn 16. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7 inclusive. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1)? No, down should be decreasing y. Let me confirm the movement directions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – up, increasing y\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) – down, decreasing y\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) – left, decreasing x\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) – right, increasing x\n> \n> Head direction is D, so moving down, meaning y is decreasing. Current head is at (5,1), so moving down would go to (5,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that would be a collision. But at turn 16, the head is at (5,1) with direction D, so it must have just moved there or something. Let me see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> With head at (5,1) and direction D, meaning it was moving down to (5,1) from (5,2)? That doesn't make sense because if it was moving down from (5,2) to (5,1), but (5,2) is the second segment, so the head was at (5,2) before moving to (5,1)? Let's list the positions in order: index 0: head (5,1), index 1: (5,2), index 2: (4,2), index 3: (4,3), index 4: (4,4), index 5: (5,4), index 6: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, on each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the previous position of the head is now occupied by the body, etc.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so the last move was down to (5,1). Before that, the head was at (5,2), I assume, since (5,2) is the next segment. From the positions, (5,1) to (5,2) is up? y increased from 1 to 2, but direction is D, which is down, decreasing y. Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current facing direction, not the last move direction. The problem says: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" which is the current direction it's facing, so for the next move, it can choose to go in that direction or change, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> So current head position: (5,1), facing down (D), so it can move down to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so that would be death. Or it can move left to (4,1) or right to (6,1), but not up because up is opposite to down, instant reverse not allowed? No instant reverse means it cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is D, so it can move D, L, or R, but not U, because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> Directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> So from current position (5,1) facing D, possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (5,0) – but y=0 is wall, collision, death.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) – left\n> \n> - R: (6,1) – right\n> \n> Cannot move U because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 7, life span 1? Food format: (x, y, value, life_span)\n> \n> It says: (4, 3, 7, 1) and (4, 4, 10, 1)\n> \n> For (4,3,7,1): at (4,3), value +7? But food value is usually +1 or -1, but here it says value 7? That seems high. Let me read.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4, 3, 7, 1) - (4, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> Value 7 and 10? But in the core rules, it says positive food reward +1, negative food penalty -1. But here values are 7 and 10, so I think for this specific state, the food has different values? The core rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, but here it's given as 7 and 10, so probably in this game, food can have different values. I should go by the state input.\n> \n> Similarly, life span: both have life span 1, meaning they disappear after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at the end of turn t, and so on, until N=0, it disappears before the next turn or something. The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: when spawned, it has life span N. After each turn, including the turn it was spawned, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or at the end of the turn.\n> \n> For example, turn 16, food with life span 1: after turn 16, life span becomes 0, so it disappears and cannot be eaten on turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 10: at turn 16, life span 10, after turn 16, it becomes 9, and so on.\n> \n> In this case, both foods have life span 1: (4,3,7,1) and (4,4,10,1). So both will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> Now, look at snake positions: head at (5,1), body at (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,4). But (4,3) and (4,4) are occupied by snake body segments.\n> \n> Specifically, position index 3: (4,3) and index 4: (4,4) are part of the snake.\n> \n> But the rule says: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, at (4,3), there is food, but it's under the body segment. Similarly, (4,4) has food under body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, meaning that cell becomes free, and then head moves there.\n> \n> But in this case, since the food has life span 1, it must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> But for the head to move to (4,3) or (4,4) this turn, it's impossible because the head is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (4,3) or (4,4). (4,3) is at x=4,y=3, head at (5,1), so Manhattan distance is |5-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Similarly, (4,4) is even farther.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (5,1), adjacent cells: (5,0) wall, (5,2) occupied by body, (4,1) free?, (6,1) free? Let's find free cells.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> So grid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so walkable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,1), which is within, so (3,1) is wall.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So occupied cells: these seven.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,4), but they are under snake body, so not accessible unless body moves.\n> \n> But for turn 16, head at (5,1), possible moves: D to (5,0) - wall, invalid. L to (4,1) - what is (4,1)? x=4,y=1. Walls: y=1 is not border, x=4 not border, internal obstacle at (3,1), not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free? Let's list all occupied.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,1) wall.\n> \n> Snake occupied: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> (4,3) and (4,4) have food under them, but for movement, the cells are occupied by snake, so head cannot move there directly.\n> \n> Free cells: all other cells not wall and not snake.\n> \n> For example, (4,1): not wall, not snake, so free.\n> \n> (6,1): not wall, not snake, free.\n> \n> (5,1) is head, but when moving, we consider the new position.\n> \n> At turn 16, from head (5,1), possible actions:\n> \n> - D: (5,0) - y=0 wall, collision, death. Not possible.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) - x=4,y=1. Not wall (since wall only at (3,1) specifically, or borders, but y=1 is not border, x=4 not border, and (4,1) not internal obstacle, so free. Also not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — no (4,1), so free.\n> \n> - R: (6,1) - x=6,y=1, not border (borders x=0,7; x=6<7, so ok), not internal obstacle, not snake, so free.\n> \n> Cannot move U because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,3) and (4,4) have life span 1, so they will disappear after this turn. Since head is not adjacent to them, and they are under body, they cannot be eaten this turn. So effectively, we can ignore them for this turn; they will vanish.\n> \n> After this turn, they are gone.\n> \n> But let's confirm the life span: at turn 16, life span 1, so after turn 16, it becomes 0, disappears. So on turn 16, if not eaten, gone forever.\n> \n> Head cannot reach them, so yes, gone.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Current snake length: 7 segments.\n> \n> After moving, if no food eaten, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,1): L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> I need to choose which one to take.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the head direction will change based on the move.\n> \n> Current direction is D.\n> \n> If I move L, new head position (4,1), new direction L.\n> \n> If move R, new head position (6,1), new direction R.\n> \n> Then for subsequent turns.\n> \n> But there are no other foods mentioned, so probably only these two foods, but they are disappearing, so after turn 16, no food on grid? But that can't be right; probably new food spawns, but the state doesn't say, so for now, I have to assume only these foods or no other foods. But in the game, food might spawn randomly, but since not specified, I think for this decision, we have to work with current state only. But to think ahead, I need to consider possible future food, but it's not given, so perhaps I should focus on survival and positioning.\n> \n> The core rules don't specify food spawning; only the current food is given. So after these disappear, no food, but that might not be fun, but I have to go with the state.\n> \n> Perhaps food spawns periodically, but not stated. To be safe, I'll assume no new food for now, and focus on not dying and being ready for future opportunities.\n> \n> But there is a risk of starvation or something, but since no food, the snake just moves around without growing.\n> \n> But the goal is to maximize score, so I need to eat positive food when possible.\n> \n> Currently, no food to eat, so I should avoid risks and stay alive.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, except (3,1) is wall.\n> \n> So cells: for y=1, x can be 1,2,4,5,6 (x=3 is wall, x=0 and7 wall)\n> \n> y=2: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 except no wall, but snake occupies some.\n> \n> List all cells for clarity.\n> \n> Playable cells:\n> \n> y=1: x=1,2,4,5,6  (x=3 wall, x=0,7 wall)\n> \n> y=2: x=1,2,3,4,5,6  (all, since no internal wall except (3,1) which is y=1)\n> \n> Internal obstacle only (3,1), so y=2: all x=1 to6 free except snake.\n> \n> y=3: all x=1 to6\n> \n> y=4: all x=1 to6\n> \n> y=5: all x=1 to6\n> \n> y=6: all x=1 to6, but y=6 is not border, y=7 is border, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n> \n> Now snake: positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So occupied: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Free cells: many, but let's see around head.\n> \n> At (5,1), after move, if to (4,1) or (6,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is free, as above.\n> \n> (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,1) or (6,1), what next.\n> \n> First, consider moving left to (4,1).\n> \n> New head position: (4,1), new direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Then, snake positions after move: head to (4,1), then body: the previous head (5,1) becomes body, so positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] and tail (5,5) is removed? When snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail moves off.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new cell, then the first body segment at old head position, second at old first body, etc., up to the second last, and tail is removed.\n> \n> Old positions: indices: 0: (5,1) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,1): new head (4,1), then body: old head (5,1) becomes segment 1, then old seg1 (5,2) becomes seg2, old seg2 (4,2) becomes seg3, old seg3 (4,3) becomes seg4, old seg4 (4,4) becomes seg5, old seg5 (5,4) becomes seg6 (tail), and old tail (5,5) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> (4,3) and (4,4) are still occupied, but the food there is gone after this turn.\n> \n> New head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1): since direction L, can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> L: (3,1) - but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid, death.\n> \n> U: (4,2) - but (4,2) is occupied by body, in new positions, (4,2) is segment 3?

Possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but cannot reverse direction instantly (from R cannot go L).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,2).\n   - Check if (6,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not a border, y=2 is not a border, and not (3,1).\n     - Not occupied by snake's body: (6,2) is not in [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)].\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: Move to (6,0).\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,1).\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n4. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,1).\n   - (5,1) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n   - Rule: Can move into tail's position, but (5,1) is not the tail (tail is at (5,4)).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n\n**Conclusion at Turn 17**: Only valid move is **U (Up)** to (6,2).\n\n### Simulating the Next Moves\n\nAfter moving U to (6,2) at Turn 17, the snake's new positions are:\n- Head moves to (6,2).\n- Each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead:\n  - New positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n  - Tail is now at (4,4).\n\nFood updates:\n- Life spans decrease by 1:\n  - (4,3): life_span = 5.\n  - (4,4): life_span = 8.\n\n**Turn 18**:\n- Head at (6,2), direction is now U (since we moved U).\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse direction (from U cannot go D).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,1).\n   - (6,1) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,2).\n   - (5,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,2).\n   - x=7 is wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n**Conclusion at Turn 18**: Only valid move is **U (Up)** to (6,3).\n\nAfter moving U to (6,3) at Turn 18:\n- New positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)].\n- Tail is now at (4,3).\n\nFood updates:\n- (4,3): life_span = 4.\n- (4,4): life_span = 7.\n- Food at (4,4) is now free (not under snake).\n\n**Turn 19**:\n- Head at (6,3), direction U.\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot go D (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,4).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,2).\n   - (6,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,3).\n   - x=7 is wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\nNow we have two valid moves: U or L.\n\n**Choosing Between U and L at Turn 19**:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,4).\n- Then at Turn 20, from (6,4), can move L to (5,4) to approach (4,4) food.\n- Can eat (4,4) at Turn 21 by moving L to (4,4).\n- Then can eat (4,3) at Turn 22 by moving D to (4,3).\n\nOption 2: Move L to (5,3).\n- Then at Turn 20, can move L to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n- Then at Turn 21, can move U to (4,4) to eat (4,4).\n\nBoth options allow eating both foods, but Option 2 eats the food with shorter life span (4,3) first, which is safer to ensure we don't lose it.\n\n**Choosing Option 2**: Move L at Turn 19 to prioritize eating (4,3).\n\n**Turn 19**: Move **L (Left)** to (5,3).\n\nAfter moving L to (5,3) at Turn 19:\n- New positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,3) is now free (not under snake).\n- Food updates:\n  - (4,3): life_span = 3.\n  - (4,4): life_span = 6.\n\n**Turn 20**:\n- Head at (5,3), direction L.\n- Possible moves: L, U, D, cannot go R (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Left (L)**: (4,3).\n   - (4,3) has food (value +1).\n   - Valid move to eat.\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,4).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,2).\n   - (5,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n\nBest move is **L (Left)** to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving L to (4,3) at Turn 20 (eating):\n- Snake grows by 1: new tail added at (4,2).\n- New positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,3) is consumed.\n- Food at (4,4) remains with life_span = 5.\n\n**Turn 21**:\n- Head at (4,3), direction L.\n- Possible moves: L, U, D, cannot go R (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Left (L)**: (3,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,4).\n   - (4,4) has food (value +1).\n   - Valid move to eat.\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,2).\n   - (4,2) is tail.\n   - Rule: Can move into tail's position because tail will move away.\n   - Valid, but less optimal than eating food.\n\nBest move is **U (Up)** to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4) at Turn 21 (eating):\n- Snake grows by 1: new tail added at (4,2).\n- New positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,4) is consumed.\n\n**Turn 22**:\n- Head at (4,4), direction U.\n- Possible moves: U, L, R, cannot go D (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5).\n   -

So:\n> \n> - Food at (4,3): life_span=6, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and scores +1.\n> \n> Now, life span: at turn t=17, food at (4,3) has life_span=6, meaning it will disappear after 6 more turns, so at turn 23 (17+6=23). Similarly, food at (4,4) has life_span=9, disappears at turn 26 (17+9=26).\n> \n> But life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So if the snake moves onto it this turn, it can eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,1), direction right. So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction, so from R, I cannot move L. I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Current position: head (6,1), body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,2) – but y=0 to y=7, so (6,2) is within bounds? y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it doesn't specify, but since it's coordinates, I think (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up or down? The movement says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, D is (x,y-1), so y decreases down.\n> \n> So from (6,1):\n> \n> - U: (6,1+1) = (6,2)\n> \n> - D: (6,1-1) = (6,0) – but y=0 is a border wall? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,0) has y=0, which is a wall, so moving D to (6,0) would be a wall collision, deadly. So cannot move D.\n> \n> - R: (6+1,1) = (7,1) – x=7 is border wall, so also collision. Cannot move R.\n> \n> - L: (6-1,1) = (5,1) – but (5,1) is occupied by the snake body. Now, can I move there?\n> \n> According to rules, body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving into tail, the tail moves away, so it's safe only if I'm moving to where the tail is and it will move.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, in this case, moving to (5,1): (5,1) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1) is next, which is the neck. Moving to (5,1) would mean head collides with the body segment at (5,1), which is not the tail, so it's a collision, deadly. Cannot move L.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), with head direction R:\n> \n> - D: to (6,0) wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (7,1) wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (5,1) body collision (not tail), invalid\n> \n> - U: to (6,2) – is this free? What is at (6,2)?\n> \n> Current snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n> \n> So (6,2) is not occupied by snake. Also, walls: borders and (3,1), so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> y=2 is within 0-7, x=6 within 0-7, and not (3,1), so yes, (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, food is at (4,3) and (4,4), but both are under the snake's body? Let's see.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, and (4,3) is occupied by a body segment: positions include (4,3), which is the fifth segment? List: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is position of the fourth body segment (index 4), and (4,4) is index 5.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,4) are both under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to food mechanics: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, for the food to be eaten, the snake must move so that the body segment leaves the food cell, and then later the head moves onto it.\n> \n> But in this case, both food are under body segments, not the tail currently.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,4), which has no food mentioned; food is at (4,3) and (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied by the segment at index 5, which is not the tail; tail is (5,4).\n> \n> So to eat (4,3) or (4,4), the snake needs to move so that those cells are vacated first.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 17, head must move to (6,2) as only option.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,2), what happens?\n> \n> New positions: head moves to (6,2), then the body: the segment that was at (6,1) moves to where the head was? No, when snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So sequence: new head position (6,2), then body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (6,1), second to old first body position (5,1), and so on, tail moves to old second last position.\n> \n> Current positions before move: [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) ]\n> \n> After move U to (6,2):\n> \n> - Head to (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was (5,1)) moves to (6,1)  // since head was at (6,1), now it moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: the segment that was behind head moves to head's old position.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake shifts; head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - New position for segment 1: old position of head, (6,1)\n> \n> - New position for segment 2: old position of segment 1, (5,1)\n> \n> - New position for segment 3: old position of segment 2, (5,2)\n> \n> - New position for segment 4: old position of segment 3, (4,2)\n> \n> - New position for segment 5: old position of segment 4, (4,3)\n> \n> - New position for segment 6 (tail): old position of segment 5, (4,4)\n> \n> Old segment 5 was at (4,4), so tail moves to (4,4).\n> \n> Old tail was at (5,4), which is now vacated because the segment before it moved to (4,4).\n> \n> New positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> Tail is now at (4,4).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (4,4): (4,3) is now occupied by a body segment (new position 5, which was old segment 4), and (4,4) is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Life span decreases: after this turn, turn 18, life span of food at (4,3) decreases to 5, and (4,4) to 8.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), direction: since it moved U, new head direction is U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move D (opposite of U).\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,3) - is it free? Walls: x=0-7, y=0-7, obstacle at (3,1), not (6,3). Snake positions: after move, snake is at (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So (6,3) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> - D: (6,1) - but (6,1) is occupied by segment 1, not tail. So body collision, cannot move D.\n> \n> - L: (5,2) - (5,2) is occupied by segment 3, not tail, so collision, cannot.\n> \n> - R: (7,2) - x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,3).\n> \n> Move U to (6,3).\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head to (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 to (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2 to (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3 to (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4 to (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5 to (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6 to (4,3)  // tail\n> \n> Tail at (4,3)\n> \n> Food: (4,3) has food, and now tail is at (4,3).

Old segment 5 was at (4,2) before move?

Let's see.\n> \n> Suppose tail cell has food, and head is adjacent to tail. If head moves to tail cell to eat, then after eating, the head is on that cell, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, but since head moved to it, it's the same cell, so head and new segment on same cell? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Mechanism: when head moves to a cell with food, it consumes it, and for positive food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move during that turn. So the cell that was tail remains occupied, and the head is on the new cell, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> But the danger is that after eating, the new tail is where the old tail was, and if head was adjacent, after moving, head might be next to the new tail or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose head at A, tail at B, and B has food. Head is adjacent to B. If head moves to B to eat, then after move, head is at B, and the tail remains at B? No.\n> \n> Positions: before move, positions [H, ..., T] with T at B, B has food.\n> \n> Head moves to B to eat. Since eating, the tail does not move, so new positions: head at B, and the body segments move to previous positions, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment is still at B, but head is also at B, collision immediately.\n> \n> That's the problem.\n> \n> So, you can only eat food on tail cell if the tail has moved away, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> In the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For tail cell, if tail moves away, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, if tail moves away, the food is exposed, and head can move to it, but after eating, the new tail is added, which might be where the head was, and if that is adjacent to the new head, it could cause a collision on next moves.\n> \n> The rule specifies: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, the head is at the food position, and a new segment is added at the end, so the new tail is the old tail position if the tail didn't move, but when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that was not tail, it's fine.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (4,3) or (4,4), they are not on the tail cell when we eat, so no tail reward danger.\n> \n> For example, when I eat (4,3) at turn 20, tail is at (4,2), not at (4,3), so (4,3) is free, head moves to it, no problem.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4).\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> At turn 19, from (6,3), I can choose to move U or L.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,4), I can later go to eat (4,4).\n> \n> If I move L to (5,3), I can eat (4,3) sooner.\n> \n> But (4,3) has shorter life span, only 3 turns left at turn 20, while (4,4) has 6, so (4,3) is more urgent to eat if possible.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake is longer, which might be riskier in this area.\n> \n> The grid has walls and obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Current snake is in the bottom-right area.\n> \n> To maximize score, I should eat both foods if possible.\n> \n> But I need to survive long term.\n> \n> From turn 17, I must move U to (6,2)\n> \n> Turn 18: U to (6,3)\n> \n> Then turn 19: I need to decide.\n> \n> If I move L to (5,3) at turn 19, then turn 20 I can move L to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n> \n> After eating, head at (4,3), tail at (4,2), but with new segment, tail at (4,2) still?
