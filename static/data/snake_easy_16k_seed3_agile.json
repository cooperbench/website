Length = 2.\n- **Head Direction**: Up (U). Last move was upward to (3,5).\n- **Possible Moves**: U, L, R (cannot reverse to D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): value +1, life span 8 (available until Turn 9).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 8 (available until Turn 9).\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 9 (available until Turn 10).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move U to (3,6)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,6). Snake grows to length 3: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].\n   - Next moves: From (3,6), can only move L or R (U is wall, D is body).\n   - Risk: Trapped at the top edge with limited mobility.\n\n2. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - Eat food at (2,5). Snake grows to length 3: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n   - Next moves: From (2,5), can move U, D, or L (R is body).\n   - Advantage: Central position, more flexibility for future moves.\n\n3. **Move R to (4,5)**:\n   - No food eaten. Snake remains length 2: [(4,5), (3,5)].\n   - Next moves: From (4,5), can move U, D, or R (L is body).\n   - Advantage: Keeps snake short, avoids immediate edge risks.\n\n### Long-Term Considerations:\n- **Eating (3,6) first** risks trapping the snake at the top edge, making it harder to reach other food later.\n- **Eating (2,5) first** is safer, as it's centrally located and allows more maneuverability to reach (5,2) and (3,6) later.\n- **Not eating immediately** (moving R to (4,5)) delays growth but preserves flexibility. However, it may miss the opportunity to eat (3,6) later due to distance.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Action:\nThe best balance between immediate reward and long-term survival is to **eat the centrally located food at (2,5)**. This grows the snake while keeping it in a flexible position to navigate toward other food later.\n\n### Action Sequence (Example):\n1. **Turn 2**: Move L to (2,5) (eat).\n2. **Turn 3**: Move D to (2,4).\n3. **Turn 4**: Move D to (2,3).\n4. **Turn 5**: Move D to (2,2).\n5. **Turn 6**: Move R to (3,2).\n6. Continue toward (5,2) to eat by Turn 9, then navigate to (3,6) if possible.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",

Eating it would increase the snake's length to 6.\n   - The tail would stay at (5, 6) since the snake grows.\n   - New head direction: D.\n2. **L (Left)**: Move to (3, 3)\n   - No food here. The tail would move forward to (5, 5).\n   - New head direction: L.\n3. **R (Right)**: Move to (5, 3)\n   - No food here. The tail would move forward to (5, 5).\n   - New head direction: R.\n- **U (Up)**: Not allowed (opposite of current direction D).\n\n### Considerations:\n1. **Food at (4, 2)**:\n   - Life span = 4, so it will disappear after Turn 16. Eating it now is safe and maximizes the chance to collect it.\n   - Moving down to (4, 2) is the only way to eat it immediately.\n2. **Food at (4, 3)**:\n   - Cannot be eaten now because the head is already on it. We must move away and return later to eat it.\n3. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - Life span = 7, so it will be available until Turn 19. We can plan to eat it later.\n4. **Risks**:\n   - Moving down to (4, 2) is safe (no collision with body or walls).\n   - Moving left or right is also safe but does not collect food immediately.\n\n### Decision:\n- The best immediate action is to **move down to (4, 2)** to eat the positive food (+1) before it disappears. This maximizes the score and does not pose any immediate risk.\n\n### Action Sequence (for Turns 13-17):\n1. **Turn 13**: D (eat food at (4, 2))\n2. **Turn 14**: D (move to (4, 1))\n3. **Turn 15**: R (move to (5, 1), eat food at (5, 1))\n4. **Turn 16**: U (move to (5, 2))\n5. **Turn 17**: U (move to (5, 3))\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

Possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but cannot reverse direction instantly (from R cannot go L).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,2).\n   - Check if (6,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not a border, y=2 is not a border, and not (3,1).\n     - Not occupied by snake's body: (6,2) is not in [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)].\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: Move to (6,0).\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,1).\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n4. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,1).\n   - (5,1) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n   - Rule: Can move into tail's position, but (5,1) is not the tail (tail is at (5,4)).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n\n**Conclusion at Turn 17**: Only valid move is **U (Up)** to (6,2).\n\n### Simulating the Next Moves\n\nAfter moving U to (6,2) at Turn 17, the snake's new positions are:\n- Head moves to (6,2).\n- Each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead:\n  - New positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n  - Tail is now at (4,4).\n\nFood updates:\n- Life spans decrease by 1:\n  - (4,3): life_span = 5.\n  - (4,4): life_span = 8.\n\n**Turn 18**:\n- Head at (6,2), direction is now U (since we moved U).\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse direction (from U cannot go D).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,1).\n   - (6,1) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,2).\n   - (5,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,2).\n   - x=7 is wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\n**Conclusion at Turn 18**: Only valid move is **U (Up)** to (6,3).\n\nAfter moving U to (6,3) at Turn 18:\n- New positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)].\n- Tail is now at (4,3).\n\nFood updates:\n- (4,3): life_span = 4.\n- (4,4): life_span = 7.\n- Food at (4,4) is now free (not under snake).\n\n**Turn 19**:\n- Head at (6,3), direction U.\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot go D (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,4).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,2).\n   - (6,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,3).\n   - x=7 is wall.\n   - Invalid (wall collision).\n\nNow we have two valid moves: U or L.\n\n**Choosing Between U and L at Turn 19**:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,4).\n- Then at Turn 20, from (6,4), can move L to (5,4) to approach (4,4) food.\n- Can eat (4,4) at Turn 21 by moving L to (4,4).\n- Then can eat (4,3) at Turn 22 by moving D to (4,3).\n\nOption 2: Move L to (5,3).\n- Then at Turn 20, can move L to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n- Then at Turn 21, can move U to (4,4) to eat (4,4).\n\nBoth options allow eating both foods, but Option 2 eats the food with shorter life span (4,3) first, which is safer to ensure we don't lose it.\n\n**Choosing Option 2**: Move L at Turn 19 to prioritize eating (4,3).\n\n**Turn 19**: Move **L (Left)** to (5,3).\n\nAfter moving L to (5,3) at Turn 19:\n- New positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,3) is now free (not under snake).\n- Food updates:\n  - (4,3): life_span = 3.\n  - (4,4): life_span = 6.\n\n**Turn 20**:\n- Head at (5,3), direction L.\n- Possible moves: L, U, D, cannot go R (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Left (L)**: (4,3).\n   - (4,3) has food (value +1).\n   - Valid move to eat.\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,4).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,2).\n   - (5,2) is body segment (not tail).\n   - Invalid (body collision).\n\nBest move is **L (Left)** to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving L to (4,3) at Turn 20 (eating):\n- Snake grows by 1: new tail added at (4,2).\n- New positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,3) is consumed.\n- Food at (4,4) remains with life_span = 5.\n\n**Turn 21**:\n- Head at (4,3), direction L.\n- Possible moves: L, U, D, cannot go R (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Left (L)**: (3,3).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,4).\n   - (4,4) has food (value +1).\n   - Valid move to eat.\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,2).\n   - (4,2) is tail.\n   - Rule: Can move into tail's position because tail will move away.\n   - Valid, but less optimal than eating food.\n\nBest move is **U (Up)** to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4) at Turn 21 (eating):\n- Snake grows by 1: new tail added at (4,2).\n- New positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)].\n- Tail is at (4,2).\n- Food at (4,4) is consumed.\n\n**Turn 22**:\n- Head at (4,4), direction U.\n- Possible moves: U, L, R, cannot go D (reverse).\n  \nEvaluate moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5).\n   - Valid: not wall, not body.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
