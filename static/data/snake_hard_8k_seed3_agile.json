Internal obstacles at [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)].\n\n### Possible Moves:\nCurrent head direction is R (right), so we cannot move left (reverse). Possible moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by body (tail is at (4,4)), safe.\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by body, safe.\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n   - Check: (6,4) is an internal obstacle (wall), so cannot move here.\n\nThus, possible actions: U or D.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (5,6): Up and right from (5,4). To reach it, we can go U to (5,5), then U to (5,6).\n- (5,1): Down and right from (5,4). To reach it, we can go D to (5,3), then D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n- (4,6): Left and up from (5,4). To reach it, we can go U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n- (5,2): Down and right from (5,4). Can be reached via D to (5,3), then D to (5,2).\n\n### Life Spans:\n- (5,6) and (5,1) disappear at \\( t = 10 \\).\n- (4,6) disappears at \\( t = 11 \\).\n- (5,2) disappears at \\( t = 14 \\).\n\n### Strategy:\nFrom the previous thinking model, the plan was to go right at \\( t = 4 \\) to (5,4), then up to (5,5) at \\( t = 5 \\), then up to (5,6) at \\( t = 6 \\) to eat, then left to (4,6) at \\( t = 7 \\) to eat. This allows eating two foods quickly while keeping options open for (5,2) later.\n\nAt \\( t = 5 \\), the snake is at (5,4), and the next move should be U to (5,5) to follow this plan.\n\n### Verification:\n- Moving U to (5,5) is safe (not a wall, not body).\n- Next move at \\( t = 6 \\) would be U to (5,6) to eat (5,6), which is present until \\( t = 10 \\).\n- Then at \\( t = 7 \\), move L to (4,6) to eat (4,6), which is present until \\( t = 11 \\).\n- This aligns with maximizing score by eating two foods early.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action at \\( t_0 = 5 \\) should be to move **Up (U)** to (5,5) to follow the planned path for eating (5,6) and (4,6).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are:\n1. **U (Up)**: (5,7) → y=7 is a wall (deadly collision).\n2. **L (Left)**: (4,6) → contains food (value +1).\n3. **R (Right)**: (6,6) → empty.\n4. **D (Down)**: Not allowed (reverse of current direction U).\n\nThus, the valid moves are **L (to (4,6))** or **R (to (6,6))**.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Move L to (4,6)**:\n   - Eat food at (4,6): score +1, snake grows to length 4.\n   - New snake positions: head at (4,6), body at (5,6), (5,5), tail at (5,4).\n   - Next turn: From (4,6), possible moves:\n     - U: (4,7) → wall (deadly).\n     - D: (4,5) → body segment (5,5) is not the tail (collision).\n     - L: (3,6) → obstacle (deadly).\n     - R: (5,6) → body segment (collision).\n   - **Dead end**: No safe moves after eating (4,6), leading to inevitable death.\n\n2. **Move R to (6,6)**:\n   - No food eaten: snake moves to [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)], tail (5,4) removed.\n   - Next turn: From (6,6), possible moves:\n     - U: (6,7) → wall (deadly).\n     - D: (6,5) → empty.\n     - L: (5,6) → body segment (collision).\n     - R: (7,6) → wall (deadly).\n   - Only safe move: D to (6,5).\n   - After moving to (6,5), the snake can continue exploring safely.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving L to (4,6) leads to a dead end (no safe moves afterward).\n- Moving R to (6,6) allows the snake to continue surviving and potentially reach other food (e.g., (6,5) or (5,2) later).\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

Moving here is safe (tail will move away).\n   - No food at (5,6), so no growth.\n   - Next turn (turn 11), the snake can move L to (4,6) to eat the food there before it disappears.\n\n2. **Move D (down) to (5,4)**:\n   - (5,4) is free (no walls or obstacles).\n   - No food at (5,4), so no growth.\n   - Moves away from the food at (4,6), which might disappear before the snake can reach it.\n\n3. **Move L (left) to (4,5)**:\n   - (4,5) is free (no walls or obstacles).\n   - No food at (4,5), so no growth.\n   - Next turn (turn 11), the snake can move U to (4,6) to eat the food there before it disappears.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- The food at (4,6) is the most urgent because it will disappear after turn 11. To eat it, the snake must reach it by turn 11.\n- To reach (4,6) by turn 11, the snake can:\n  - Move U to (5,6) at turn 10, then L to (4,6) at turn 11.\n  - Move L to (4,5) at turn 10, then U to (4,6) at turn 11.\n- Both sequences allow the snake to eat the food at (4,6) before it disappears.\n- Moving D at turn 10 would make it impossible to reach (4,6) in time.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to move towards the food at (4,6). Between the two options (U or L at turn 10), moving L to (4,5) is slightly better because it positions the snake closer to other potential moves after eating the food (e.g., moving down to (4,4) or left to (3,5)).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

However, the current state shows the snake at [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)], indicating the snake moved left (L) to (4,5) at turn 10 instead of down (D). \n\nGiven this discrepancy, we must now decide the immediate action for turn \\( t_0 = 11 \\) based on the current state and the previous plan's intent (to prioritize eating (5,2)). \n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- **Snake Positions**: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)] (head at (4,5), direction L).\n- **Possible Moves**: \n  - U (to (4,6)): Food at (4,6) (value +1, life span 1). This is the tail segment (tail is at (6,6)), so moving here is safe (no Tail Reward Danger). Eating this food grows the snake to length 5.\n  - D (to (4,4)): Free cell.\n  - L (to (3,5)): Free cell.\n  - R (to (5,5)): Body collision (segment at (5,5) is not the tail).\n\n### Decision:\nThe previous plan aimed to eat (5,2), but the snake is now at (4,5). To reach (5,2), the snake must move down (D) to (4,4) at turn 11, then right (R) to (5,4) at turn 12, then down (D) to (5,3) at turn 13, and finally down (D) to (5,2) at turn 14. However, (5,2) disappears after turn 13, so this path is too slow. \n\nAlternatively, the snake can eat (4,6) at turn 11 (last chance, as it disappears after turn 11). This is feasible and scores +1, but may limit future movement. \n\nGiven the urgency of (4,6) (life span 1) and the impossibility of reaching (5,2) in time, the best immediate action is to eat (4,6) at turn 11.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{U} \n\n### Explanation:\nMove up (U) to (4,6) to eat the +1 food before it disappears, scoring +1 and growing the snake. This aligns with the previous plan's intent to maximize score while avoiding risks. The move is safe (no Tail Reward Danger) and exploits the last chance to eat (4,6).",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn \\( t_0 = 17 \\))\n\nFirst, let's parse the current state of the game at Turn 17:\n\n1. **Grid and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] (head at (4,5), tail at (5,6)).\n   - Current direction: Left (L), meaning the snake was moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) last turn.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (2,1): value +1, life_span 4 (will disappear after Turn 20).\n   - (3,5): value +1, life_span 6 (will disappear after Turn 22).\n   - (1,3): value +1, life_span 9 (will disappear after Turn 25).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 17\n\nFrom the head position (4,5), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: The snake cannot move Right (R) because that would reverse the current Left (L) direction.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential benefits:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Check if (4,6) is safe:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not a border, y=6 is not a border (y=7 is).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (4,6) is not in the obstacle list.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body: Current body segments are at (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). (4,6) is not in this list.\n   - Conclusion: Safe to move Up.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check if (4,4) is safe:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Safe to move Down.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Check if (3,5) is safe:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Has food: (3,5) is a food position with value +1.\n   - Additional check for eating food:\n     - Eating increases length by 1, so the tail doesn't move next turn.\n     - Need to ensure that after eating, the new tail position doesn't cause a collision.\n     - Current tail is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (3,5), so no immediate collision risk.\n   - Conclusion: Safe to move Left and eat the food.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nNow, let's evaluate which move is the best at Turn 17:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Immediate benefit: Eat +1 food, increasing score and length.\n   - Future implications: After eating, the snake grows, so the tail stays at (5,6), and the new segment is added at (5,6). The next moves need to ensure the snake doesn't trap itself.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - No immediate food benefit.\n   - Future moves: From (4,6), possible moves would be limited (e.g., cannot move Down next turn due to no instant reverse).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - No immediate food benefit.\n   - Future moves: From (4,4), can potentially move towards other food, but (3,5) is closer and more immediately accessible.\n\nGiven that (3,5) is a positive food with a limited lifespan (disappears after Turn 22), and it's safely accessible now, moving Left to eat it is the optimal choice to maximize score.\n\n### Verifying the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous thinking model at Turn 16 suggested the following action sequence:\n- Turn 16: L (from (5,5) to (4,5))\n- Turn 17: L (from (4,5) to (3,5)) to eat food.\n\nThis aligns with our current analysis, confirming that moving Left at Turn 17 is consistent with the prior plan to eat the food at (3,5).\n\n### Potential Risks After Eating (3,5)\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) and eating the food, the snake's new positions will be:\n- Head: (3,5)\n- Body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) (tail remains at (5,6) since length increases).\n\nNext possible moves from (3,5):\n- Current direction: Left (L).\n- Cannot move Right (R) (opposite direction).\n- Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n\nCheck each:\n1. **Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - (3,6) is an internal obstacle → unsafe.\n2. **Down (D) to (3,4)**:\n   - (3,4) is an internal obstacle → unsafe.\n3. **Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - (2,5) is safe (not wall, not obstacle, not body).\n   - No food, but safe for movement.\n\nThus, the only safe move after eating is Left to (2,5), which is acceptable.\n\n### Long-term Considerations\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), the snake can then navigate towards the next food at (1,3), as per the previous plan. The sequence would be:\n- Turn 18: L to (2,5)\n- Turn 19: L to (1,5)\n- Turn 20: D to (1,4)\n- Turn 21: D to (1,3) to eat the next food.\n\nThis ensures the snake maximizes score by eating both (3,5) and (1,3) while avoiding obstacles and walls.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 17\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate action at Turn 17 is to move Left (L) to (3,5) to eat the positive food, aligning with the previous plan and ensuring maximum score gain safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This is a potential \"Tail Reward Danger\" scenario.\n\n- **Obstacles/Walls**:\n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n### Possible Moves from (2, 5) at Turn 19\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2, 6)\n   - Check if (2, 6) is accessible:\n     - Not a border wall (y=6 is not y=7 or y=0).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles include (1,6) and (3,6), but not (2,6)).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (snake is at (2,5), (3,5), etc., not (2,6)).\n   - So, (2, 6) is free.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (2, 4)\n   - Check if (2, 4) is accessible:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - It is an internal obstacle (listed as (2,4)).\n   - So, (2, 4) is blocked.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (1, 5)\n   - Check if (1, 5) is accessible:\n     - Not a border wall (x=1 is not x=0 or x=7).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not in the list).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - So, (1, 5) is free.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (3, 5)\n   - Check if (3, 5) is accessible:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - It is the second segment of the snake's body.\n     - Also, moving right is the reverse of the current left direction, which is not allowed.\n   - So, (3, 5) is blocked.\n\nThus, the possible moves are **Up (U) to (2, 6)** or **Left (L) to (1, 5)**.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (2, 6)**\n\n- New head position: (2, 6)\n- New direction: Up (U)\n- Snake's new positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] (tail at (6,5))\n  \nNow, let's look ahead to Turn 20 from (2,6):\n\nPossible moves from (2,6) with direction U:\n- Up (U): (2,7) → y=7 is a border wall → blocked.\n- Down (D): (2,5) → reverse direction (current is U) → not allowed.\n- Left (L): (1,6) → internal obstacle → blocked.\n- Right (R): (3,6) → internal obstacle → blocked.\n\nAll moves from (2,6) are blocked! This leads to a dead end where the snake cannot move further and will collide on the next turn. Therefore, moving Up is not viable.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (1, 5)**\n\n- New head position: (1, 5)\n- New direction: Left (L)\n- Snake's new positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] (tail at (6,5))\n  \nNow, look ahead to Turn 20 from (1,5):\n\nPossible moves from (1,5) with direction L:\n- Up (U): (1,6) → internal obstacle → blocked.\n- Down (D): (1,4) → not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by snake → free.\n- Left (L): (0,5) → x=0 is a border wall → blocked.\n- Right (R): (2,5) → second segment of snake's body → collision, and reverse direction (current is L) → not allowed.\n\nOnly possible move is Down (D) to (1,4).\n\n**Turn 20: Move Down (D) to (1,4)**\n\n- New head position: (1,4)\n- New direction: Down (D)\n- Snake's new positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] (tail at (5,5))\n  \nNow, look ahead to Turn 21 from (1,4):\n\nPossible moves from (1,4) with direction D:\n- Up (U): (1,5) → reverse direction (current is D) → not allowed.\n- Down (D): (1,3) → not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by snake → free.\n- Left (L): (0,4) → x=0 is a border wall → blocked.\n- Right (R): (2,4) → internal obstacle → blocked.\n\nOnly possible move is Down (D) to (1,3), which has positive food (+1).\n\n**Turn 21: Move Down (D) to (1,3) and eat food**\n\n- Eat food at (1,3): +1 score, snake length increases by 1.\n- New head position: (1,3)\n- New direction: Down (D)\n- Snake's new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] (length 7, tail at (5,5))\n\nThis sequence successfully eats the positive food at (1,3) without leading to any immediate dead ends.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nAt Turn 19, the tail is at (6,6), which has positive food (6,6,10,1). However, the head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1). Therefore, there is no immediate Tail Reward Danger at Turn 19.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 19\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Moving Up (U) leads to a dead end at Turn 20.\n- Moving Left (L) allows the snake to proceed safely and eventually eat the positive food at (1,3).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action at Turn 19 is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move D to (4, 2) on turn 25.\n   - This sets up the possibility to move L to (3, 2) on turn 26 to eat the food.\n2. On turn 26, move L to (3, 2) to eat the food (if still available and no new obstacles).\n\n### Why Not Other Moves?\n- Moving U or R doesn't directly help in eating food soon.\n- The food at (6, 6) is unreachable in time.\n- The food at (1, 5) requires complex maneuvering and is not immediately accessible.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **D (down)** to (4, 2) to position the snake to potentially eat the food at (3, 2) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The planned action is U (up), which would move the head to (4, 3). \n\nLet's verify if this move is valid:\n1. **Direction Check**: Current direction is D (down). Moving U (up) is not an instant reverse, so it's allowed.\n2. **Collision Check**: (4, 3) is not a wall or obstacle. The snake's current body segments are [(4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]. The cell (4, 3) is occupied by the second body segment, but this is the tail segment (since the tail is at (1, 5) and the segment at (4, 3) is the one that will move away when the head moves to (4, 3)). Therefore, this is safe (the tail will move forward, and the head can occupy (4, 3) without collision).\n3. **Food Check**: There is no food at (4, 3), so no eating occurs.\n\nThus, the move U is valid and aligns with the previous plan. \n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5, 4)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (5,4) is not in the current body segments.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (4,3) is the tail segment (last in the list). \n     - Moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away in the same turn, provided no food is eaten.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: (6,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (6,3) is not in the current body segments.\n   - Valid move.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (5, 4)**:\n   - New head position: (5,4).\n   - No food at (5,4), so tail moves: new tail is (3,3) moves off, new body segments are (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4):\n     - U to (5,5): food present, can eat.\n     - L to (4,4): not a wall, not occupied.\n     - R to (6,4): wall at (6,4), invalid.\n     - D to (5,3): body segment, deadly.\n   - If we go U to (5,5), we can eat the food there, increasing length.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Current tail is at (3,3), and (4,3) is the tail segment.\n   - Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away (since no food is eaten).\n   - New head position: (4,3).\n   - Body segments: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,3).\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n     - U to (4,4): not a wall, not occupied.\n     - D to (4,2): body segment (4,2), deadly.\n     - L to (3,3): body segment, deadly.\n     - R to (5,3): body segment, deadly.\n   - Only possible move is U to (4,4), which doesn't lead to immediate food.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - New head position: (6,3).\n   - No food, tail moves: new body segments: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n   - Next possible moves from (6,3):\n     - U to (6,4): wall at (6,4), invalid.\n     - D to (6,2): not a wall, not occupied.\n     - L to (5,3): body segment, deadly.\n     - R to (7,3): wall, invalid.\n   - Only possible moves are D to (6,2), which doesn't lead to immediate food.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous thinking model at Turn 29 suggested a sequence: U, U, U, L, L to eat the food at (5,5). Now at Turn 30, the snake is at (5,3), having just moved U from (5,2). The next step in the plan is to move U to (5,4).\n\n### Checking Food Accessibility\n\n- **(5,5)**: Can be reached by moving U twice from (5,3): (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5). This is safe and aligns with the previous plan.\n- **(3,2)**: To reach this, we'd need to navigate around the body, which is complex and time-consuming given its life span.\n- **(1,5)**: Too far and will disappear soon (after Turn 32), making it risky to pursue.\n\n### Decision for Turn 30\n\nGiven the above, the safest and most rewarding immediate action is to continue with the previous plan and move **Up (U)** to (5,4), setting up to eat the food at (5,5) on the next turn.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- Moving U to (5,4) is safe:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not colliding with body (current body is (5,2), (5,1), etc., not (5,4)).\n- Next move can be U to (5,5) to eat food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the current state and the previous plan, the immediate action at Turn 30 is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Borders (\\( x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 \\)) and certain internal cells are walls or obstacles.\n  \n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head at (4,3), followed by body segments: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n  - Length: 9 segments\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Down (D)\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,2): value = +1, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n  - (2,3): value = +1, life_span = 9 (will disappear after turn 43)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 35\n\nFrom the head position (4,3) with current direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: To (4,4)\n   - (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment) → Collision → Invalid\n\n2. **Down (D)**: To (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is free:\n     - Not in snake positions: Yes\n     - Not an obstacle: Yes\n     - Within bounds: Yes (x=4, y=2 is within 1-6)\n   - Valid move\n\n3. **Left (L)**: To (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is free:\n     - Not in snake positions: Yes\n     - Not an obstacle: Yes\n     - Within bounds: Yes\n   - Valid move\n\n4. **Right (R)**: To (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is occupied by the snake's body (sixth segment) → Collision → Invalid\n\nAdditionally, moving Up (U) is the reverse of the current direction Down (D), so it's invalid due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n\n**Valid Moves**: Down (D) to (4,2) or Left (L) to (3,3)\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\n1. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Life_span = 1 at turn 35 → disappears after this turn.\n   - To eat it, must move head to (3,2) this turn.\n   - From (4,3), (3,2) is diagonally adjacent (left-down), not directly adjacent (must move left then down or down then left).\n   - Cannot reach (3,2) in one move → Cannot eat this food → Ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (2,3)**:\n   - Life_span = 9 → available until turn 43.\n   - Can plan to eat it in future turns.\n\n### Planning Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Left (L) to (3,3) at turn 35**\n- New head at (3,3), direction now L.\n- Next turn (36), from (3,3), possible moves:\n  - U to (3,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - D to (3,2): Free\n  - L to (2,3): Food present\n  - R to (4,3): Reverse → Invalid\n- Best move at turn 36: L to (2,3) to eat food.\n  - After eating, snake grows to length 10.\n  - Next moves may be constrained as snake is longer.\n\n**Option 2: Move Down (D) to (4,2) at turn 35**\n- New head at (4,2), direction now D.\n- Next turn (36), from (4,2), possible moves:\n  - U to (4,3): Body segment → Invalid\n  - D to (4,1): Free\n  - L to (3,2): Free (no food now)\n  - R to (5,2): Body segment → Invalid\n- Choices: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n  - Moving L to (3,2) may allow future access to (2,3) food.\n\n### Comparing Both Options\n\n- **Option 1 (L to (3,3))**:\n  - Can eat food at (2,3) next turn.\n  - After eating, may get constrained due to longer snake and obstacles.\n  \n- **Option 2 (D to (4,2))**:\n  - Delays eating food but keeps options open.\n  - Can still reach (2,3) in future turns (life_span until turn 43).\n  - Seems safer as it doesn't immediately commit to a constrained path.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food at (2,3) is available for several more turns, it's better to prioritize safety and flexibility. Moving Down (D) to (4,2) avoids immediate constraints and allows for more flexible future moves towards the food.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\nAfter moving D to (4,2):\n- Snake positions: head at (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), ..., (5,1)\n- Next turn, can move L to (3,2), then possibly L to (2,2) (obstacle) or D to (3,1) (obstacle), but better to plan to move towards (2,3) via other paths.\n\nThis seems safer than immediately moving towards the food and risking getting trapped by the snake's own body and obstacles.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully considering both options, the safer and more flexible immediate action is to move Down (D) to (4,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Internal obstacles at [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)].\n\n### Previous Plan (from Turn 43):\nThe previous plan was to prioritize eating the food at (6, 3) before it disappears. The sequence was:\n1. Turn 43: R to (3, 5).\n2. Turn 44: R to (4, 5).\n3. Turn 45: D to (4, 4).\n4. Turn 46: R to (5, 4).\n5. Turn 47: D to (5, 3).\n6. Turn 48: R to (6, 3) to eat the food.\n\n### Current Turn (Turn 44):\nAt Turn 44, the snake is at [(3, 5), (2, 5), ...], and the previous plan was to move R to (4, 5). Let's verify if this is still valid.\n\n#### Possible Moves from (3, 5):\n- **U (Up)**: (3, 6) - Check:\n  - Not a wall (border is y=7, internal obstacle at (3,6) is a wall). So invalid.\n- **D (Down)**: (3, 4) - Check:\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,4) is a wall. Invalid.\n- **L (Left)**: (2, 5) - Check:\n  - Current direction is R, so L is reverse. Invalid (no instant reverse).\n- **R (Right)**: (4, 5) - Check:\n  - Not a wall, not occupied by the snake (current tail is at (4,4)). Valid.\n\nThus, the only valid move is R to (4, 5). This aligns with the previous plan.\n\n### Next Steps:\nAfter moving R to (4, 5) at Turn 44, the next steps (from the previous plan) are:\n- Turn 45: D to (4, 4).\n- Turn 46: R to (5, 4).\n- Turn 47: D to (5, 3).\n- Turn 48: R to (6, 3) to eat the food.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake reaches (6, 3) by Turn 48, just before the food disappears at Turn 49.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 44**: Move R to (4, 5). New head at (4, 5), direction R.\n  - Snake positions: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\n  - Tail at (4, 3).\n- **Turn 45**: From (4, 5), move D to (4, 4).\n  - Valid moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). U is reverse (current direction is R, but last move was D? Need to clarify direction tracking).\n  - Assuming direction is updated after move, so after moving R to (4,5), direction is R. Then moving D is allowed (not reverse).\n  - (4, 4) is not a wall and not occupied (tail is at (4,3)). Valid.\n- **Turn 46**: From (4, 4), move R to (5, 4).\n  - Valid moves: U, D, R (L is reverse of R, invalid).\n  - (5, 4) is not a wall (internal obstacle at (6,4), not (5,4)) and not occupied. Valid.\n- **Turn 47**: From (5, 4), move D to (5, 3).\n  - Valid moves: D, L, R (U is reverse of D, invalid).\n  - (5, 3) is not a wall and not occupied. Valid.\n- **Turn 48**: From (5, 3), move R to (6, 3) to eat the food.\n  - Valid moves: U, D, R (L is reverse of R, invalid).\n  - (6, 3) is not a wall (internal obstacle at (6,4), not (6,3)) and not occupied. Valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action at Turn 44 is to move R to (4, 5), continuing the plan to reach (6, 3) in time.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Moving right (R) to (5,5) is the first step toward this.\n- (4,2): Currently under the body. To eat it, the snake must move such that the tail moves away from (4,2), then the head can move to (4,2). However, the tail is at (4,3), and (4,2) is adjacent to the tail. If the head moves to (4,2) while the tail is at (4,3), this would trigger the \"Tail Reward Danger\" (head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food), causing a collision. Thus, eating (4,2) is currently dangerous.\n\n### Decision:\nThe safest and most strategic move is to go **Right (R)** to (5,5), which:\n- Avoids immediate danger.\n- Moves toward the positive food at (6,3).\n- Does not risk colliding with the tail food at (4,2).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Inaccessible due to obstacle at (6, 4).\n   - **(4, 2)**: Life span = 5. Not reachable immediately.\n   - **(1, 4)**: Life span = 8. Occupied by the snake's body (segment at (1, 4)). Cannot be eaten unless the snake moves away and returns.\n\n4. **Immediate Action**:\n   - Only valid move is **L (Left)** to (5, 6). This avoids collision and keeps the snake alive for now.\n\n### Future Implications (Looking Ahead 5+ Turns)\n- After moving L to (5, 6), the snake will face a similar constrained path:\n  - From (5, 6), the only valid move will be L to (4, 6).\n  - From (4, 6), no valid moves will remain (D to (4, 5) is body collision, L to (3, 6) is an obstacle, and U/R are invalid). This leads to unavoidable death on turn 50.\n- No food can be eaten in this path due to inaccessibility or occupation by the snake's body.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe snake is forced into a dead end due to the constraints of the walls, obstacles, and body positions. The only possible action at \\( t_0 = 48 \\) is to move left (L) to (5, 6), even though this leads to inevitable death in a few turns. No better alternative exists given the current state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 50)\n\nLet's first parse the current state at Turn 50 to understand the snake's position, available moves, and food locations.\n\n**Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, making the playable area from (1,1) to (6,6).\n- Internal obstacles (also walls) are at: [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)].\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].\n  - Head at (4,6), followed by body segments in order.\n- Head direction: Left (L), meaning the snake was moving left to reach (4,6).\n\n**Food:**\n1. (4,2): value=1, life_span=4 (will disappear after Turn 53 if not eaten)\n2. (1,4): value=1, life_span=6 (under snake's body at index 9)\n3. (6,1): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,6) at Turn 50\n\nGiven the head is at (4,6) and the direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: to (3,6)\n  - (3,6) is an internal obstacle (wall) → invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: to (4,7)\n  - y=7 is a border wall → invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: to (4,5)\n  - (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body (index 5 in positions) → collision (unless it's the tail, which it's not).\n- **Right (R)**: to (5,6)\n  - (5,6) is the first body segment (index 1) → collision.\n  - Also, moving right is opposite to the current left direction → instant reverse is not allowed.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no valid moves from (4,6) at Turn 50 that avoid collision or walls.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Previous Move (Turn 49)\n\nAt Turn 49, the snake was at [(5,6), (6,6), ...] with head direction Left (L). Possible moves:\n- **Left (L)**: to (4,6) \n  - (4,6) is free (not a wall or body) → valid.\n- **Up (U)**: to (5,7) → wall.\n- **Down (D)**: to (5,5) \n  - (5,5) is body (index 3) → collision.\n- **Right (R)**: to (6,6) \n  - (6,6) is body and opposite direction → invalid.\n\nThus, moving Left to (4,6) was the only valid move at Turn 49, leading to the current trapped state at Turn 50.\n\n### Is There Any Alternative?\n\nGiven that moving Left at Turn 49 leads to a dead end, is there any other interpretation or possible move?\n\n- **Food at (1,4):** Under the body at index 9. To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (1,4), and the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (4,6), far from (1,4), making it impossible to reach in one move.\n  \n- **Other Foods:**\n  - (4,2) and (6,1) are too far to reach immediately.\n  \n- **Direction Change:**\n  - At Turn 49, direction was Left, so Right is forbidden. No other directions were viable.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 50\n\nSince no valid moves avoid collision, the snake is forced into a position where it must collide. The least harmful action is to choose a move that doesn't violate game rules, even if it leads to collision. \n\nHowever, since all possible moves lead to collision or walls, the only remaining option is to move Down (D) to (4,5), accepting the collision with the body.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nGiven the analysis, the only possible actions are:\n\n- **Turn 49:** L (as previously decided)\n- **Turn 50:** D (since no other moves are possible, even though it leads to collision)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",
