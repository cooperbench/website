        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food (+1, length increases) and avoiding negative food (-1, length unchanged). But in this state, all food has value 1, so it's all positive. The life span is 10 for each, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, but since we're starting at turn 0, they'll last until turn 10 if not eaten.\n\nFood can spawn under the snake, but to eat it, the body must move away and then the head moves onto it. Here, the snake is just one segment at (3,3), so no body to move away. That means if there was food under it, I could eat it immediately, but there's no food listed at (3,3). The food is at (3,1), (3,2), and (1,6).\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3)] – that's just the head, so length 1. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving left.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at those borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I need to avoid these as well.\n\nFood: (3,1,10,1), (3,2,10,1), (1,6,10,1). All have value 1 and life span 10.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, there's no body to collide with. Also, tail reward danger isn't an issue because there's no tail yet; when I eat food, I grow, but since I start at length 1, after eating, I'll have a tail.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3). Direction: L, so last move was left, meaning from (4,3) to (3,3), I assume, but since it's the start, maybe direction indicates current facing.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,3) with head direction L.\n\nI can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but no instant reverse. Since direction is L, I cannot move R immediately because that would be opposite. So allowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are available:\n\n- Up (U): (3,4) – but (3,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (3,4). So (3,4) is a wall, cannot go there.\n\n- Down (D): (3,2) – is this a wall? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is not a border wall. Internal obstacles: let's list them: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (3,2) is not in this list, so it should be free. But there's food at (3,2)? Food is at (3,2), but that's food, not a wall. I can move to cells with food to eat it.\n\n- Left (L): (2,3) – is this a wall? x=2, y=3. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=2 is fine. Internal obstacles: no (2,3), so free.\n\n- Right (R): (4,3) – but I cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction L. Even if I could, (4,3) might be free, but direction constraint prevents it.\n\nAvailable moves: U is blocked by wall at (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R not allowed.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nNow, (3,2) has food, which is positive. Since I'm length 1, eating it would make me longer.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Also, life span is 10, so I have time, but since turn 0, I should consider eating soon.\n\nThere's also food at (3,1) and (1,6).\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), I eat the food immediately, since head moves to food cell. Then my new position: head at (3,2), and since I ate, I grow, so body segments: now I have a tail at previous head, which is (3,3). So positions: [(3,2), (3,3)] after eating.\n\nThen direction: I moved down, so head direction is D.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), no food there, so no eating, positions: head at (2,3), still length 1, direction L.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, walls: let me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles, but borders are walls, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are invalid.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are possible, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n\n(3,4) is wall, which we saw.\n\nFood at (3,1), (3,2), (1,6)\n\n(3,1) is y=1, which is not border? y=0 is border, so y=1 should be playable, unless obstacle. Not listed as obstacle, so ok.\n\nSimilarly (3,2) and (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is x=1, y=6.\n\nNow, back to turn 0.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move D to (3,2): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (3,2), tail at (3,3), direction D.\n\n- Move L to (2,3): no eat, head at (2,3), length 1, direction L.\n\nIf I eat at (3,2), I get +1 score, and grow. But now I have a body segment, so I need to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,1) is below, and (1,6) is left-top.\n\nLife span 10, so I have until turn 10 to eat them.\n\nBut I should think about getting multiple foods.\n\nMoreover, there might be tail reward danger later, but not now.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), head at (3,2), tail at (3,3). Direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,2), direction D, so cannot move U (up) because opposite? Direction is down, so opposite is up.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction after moving D is down, so I cannot move up to (3,3) because that's where the tail is, but also it would be reverse direction.\n\n(3,3) is occupied by tail now, so moving there would cause collision anyway.\n\nLet's list possible moves after being at (3,2) with direction D.\n\n- U (up): to (3,3) – but (3,3) is tail, so body collision, deadly. Also, if it weren't, moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n\n- D (down): to (3,1) – (3,1) has food, and it's free? y=1, not border, not obstacle. So I can move there.\n\n- L (left): to (2,2) – is this free? x=2,y=2. Borders: x=1-6, y=1-6 ok? x=2,y=2 should be free, no obstacle listed. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (2,2) not listed. So free.\n\n- R (right): to (4,2) – (4,2)? Internal obstacles: (4,4) is wall, but (4,2) not listed. Borders ok. So free? (4,2) might be free.\n\nBut direction: since I moved down, current direction D, so moving L or R is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nU is opposite and blocked, D is same direction, L and R perpendicular.\n\nSo from (3,2) with dir D, possible: D, L, R.\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,1), I eat the food there, since (3,1) has food. Then grow to length 3: head at (3,1), body: (3,2) and (3,3).\n\nThen direction D.\n\nIf I had moved L to (2,3) at turn 0, I would be at (2,3), no body, direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: dir L, so cannot move R.\n\nU: (2,4) – is it free? y=4, x=2. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is wall, but (2,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nD: (2,2) – free, as before.\n\nL: (1,3) – x=1,y=3. Borders: x=1 is not border wall? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is playable. But internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are walls, but (1,3) not listed? Let's see: internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) is not mentioned, so should be free.\n\nR: not allowed, opposite to L.\n\nSo from (2,3) dir L, can move U, D, L.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to maximize score, so I should aim to eat all three foods if possible.\n\nFood at (3,1), (3,2), (1,6).\n\n(3,2) and (3,1) are close, vertical line.\n\n(1,6) is top-left.\n\nAlso, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut after eating, I grow, so I need to navigate with body.\n\nMoreover, internal obstacles block paths.\n\nLet me think about paths.\n\nFirst, if I eat (3,2) at turn 0, then I can eat (3,1) at turn 1 by moving down.\n\nThen I have head at (3,1), body at (3,2) and (3,3), so I'm vertical at x=3, y=1,2,3.\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen from (3,1), dir D, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,2) – but (3,2) is body, collision.\n\n- D: to (3,0) – but y=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\n- L: to (2,1) – free? x=2,y=1. Borders ok. Obstacles: (1,2) but not (2,1), (6,1) is wall but (2,1) not, so free.\n\n- R: to (4,1) – free? (4,4) wall, but (4,1) not listed.\n\nSo can move L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), no food, so positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2)? When I move, the tail moves forward, so after moving from (3,1) to (2,1), the new positions: head at (2,1), and the body segments: the previous head (3,1) becomes body, and tail (3,2) moves to where? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, when head moves to (2,1), the segment that was at (3,1) moves to where? The snake was [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] before move. Head moves to (2,1), so new head (2,1). Then body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (3,1)? No.\n\nStandard snake: positions list: head first, then body in order.\n\nBefore move: positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] with head at (3,1).\n\nAfter moving left to (2,1), new head is (2,1). Then the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1, (3,2), moves to the previous head position? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, it becomes the new head, and the tail is removed, so the new body is all segments except the last one, each moved to the next position.\n\nSpecifically: new positions: head is the new position, then the first body segment is the old head position, second body segment is the old first body position, and so on, up to the second last, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (2,1) without eating, new positions: head (2,1), then the old head (3,1) is now the first body segment, and the old first body (3,2) is now the tail segment? Let's index.\n\nBefore: index 0: head (3,1), index 1: body (3,2), index 2: tail (3,3)\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,1), so new index 0: (2,1)\n\nThen, the segment that was index 0 is now index 1: (3,1)\n\nThe segment that was index 1 is now index 2: (3,2)? But since no growth, the tail is removed, so only two segments: new head and the old head as body.\n\nPositions become: [ (2,1), (3,1) ] and (3,2) is gone.\n\nYes, length decreases? No, when no food, length stays the same, but tail moves.\n\nLength is constant unless food eaten.\n\nInitial length 2 after first eat, then after second eat length 3.\n\nAfter eating at (3,2) and (3,1), length 3.\n\nThen when I move from (3,1) to (2,1) without eating, new positions: head at (2,1), body at (3,1), and since no eat, tail (3,2) is removed, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1)] and the segment at (3,3) was tail, but when head moves, the tail is removed, so only two segments now? Length should be 3 before move, after move no eat, length 2.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nStart turn 0: snake at [(3,3)], length 1.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), eat food, so grow: new positions [(3,2), (3,3)] length 2.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), eat food, grow: new positions [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] length 3.\n\nNow turn 2: from (3,1), dir D, move to say (2,1), no food there, so no grow. New positions: head to (2,1), then the body segments: the first body segment (3,2) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to new cell without eating, the tail is removed, and all segments shift.\n\nSo positions: old head (3,1) becomes body, old body (3,2) becomes new tail, and old tail (3,3) is removed? No.\n\nList: before move: positions: [head: (3,1), body1: (3,2), body2/tail: (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,1): new head: (2,1)\n\nThen the first body segment is the old head position (3,1)\n\nThe second body segment is the old first body position (3,2)\n\nAnd the old tail (3,3) is no longer part of the snake; it is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? But that would be length 3 still, but I didn't eat, so length should decrease? I think I'm confusing.\n\nIn snake game, when you don't eat food, the snake moves forward, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed from the end. So the length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn terms of positions, the new position list is: [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]\n\nFor example, old positions: [A, B, C] where A head, B body, C tail.\n\nAfter moving to new_head D, new positions: [D, A, B] if no eat, so tail C is removed.\n\nIf eat, new positions: [D, A, B, C] , tail C stays.\n\nIn this case, before move at turn 2: positions [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] so A=(3,1), B=(3,2), C=(3,3)\n\nMove to D=(2,1) no eat, so new positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] and C=(3,3) is removed.\n\nSo now snake at [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] length 3 still? No, positions have three cells, but the tail was removed and not replaced, so length should be 2.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard snake: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats. When it eats, it grows by one, so length increases. When it doesn't eat, it moves, head to new cell, tail cell is abandoned, so length constant.\n\nSo in position list, number of segments is constant unless eating.\n\nBefore move: 3 segments.\n\nAfter move no eat: 3 segments, but the tail is different.\n\nPositions: new head at new position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed from the list, but the body shifts.\n\nExample: positions list: segment 0: head, segment 1: body, segment 2: tail.\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating: new segment 0: new head position, segment 1: old segment 0 position, segment 2: old segment 1 position. Old segment 2 position is no longer occupied.\n\nSo the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body] and old_tail is freed.\n\nIn this case, from [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] move to (2,1), new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] and (3,3) is free.\n\nLength is still 3, but the snake has moved, so the tail is now at (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten, it would be [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] with length 4.\n\nBut in this case, no eat, so positions [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with head at (2,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nDirection: I moved left, so head direction L.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 0, I have two choices: move D to (3,2) or move L to (2,3).\n\nIf I move D, I eat (3,2), grow to length 2, head at (3,2), tail at (3,3), dir D.\n\nThen at turn 1, I can move D to (3,1) to eat that food, growing to length 3, head at (3,1), body at (3,2), tail at (3,3), dir D.\n\nThen at turn 2, from (3,1), I need to move. If I move L to (2,1), no food, so positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2), dir L.\n\nThen I have food at (1,6) to get, but I'm at (2,1), which is bottom-left, and (1,6) is top-left, so I need to go up.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so x=1, y=2,4,5 are walls, so at x=1, only y=1,3,6 might be free? y=1: (1,1) not obstacle, y=3: (1,3) not obstacle, y=6: (1,6) has food.\n\nSo I can go to (1,1), (1,3), (1,6) but not (1,2), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nFrom (2,1), dir L, I can move to (1,1) or (2,2) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, or U to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move L to (2,3), no eat, so still length 1, head at (2,3), dir L.\n\nThen I can go towards (1,6) or to (3,2) etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is far, and I have to avoid obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the tail reward danger, but for now, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: food at (3,2) and (3,1) are on a column with obstacles above at (3,4) wall.\n\nIf I eat both, I'm stuck at bottom with the body.\n\nFrom (3,1), after eating both, if I move left or right, I can explore.\n\nBut let's see the food at (1,6). It has life span 10, so I need to eat it within 10 turns.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 10 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, if not eaten, life span 9, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nSo for food at turn 0, life span 10, it can be eaten on turn 0 to turn 9, and disappears after turn 10 or at turn 10? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 after the turn, and if L-1=0, it disappears before next turn or after? Let's assume that at the start of turn, food is there, and after the turn, if life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during the turn, it is eaten.\n\nIn this case, life span 10 at turn 0, so it will be there until after turn 9, I think. After turn 9, if life span was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nCountdown: at turn t, life span decreases, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, life span 9, after turn 1, 8, ..., after turn 9, life span 1, after turn 10, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 0 to 10? At turn 10, life span is still 1 before the turn? Let's clarify.\n\nThe state is given at turn t1=0, food has life span 10. After each turn, including the current, life span decreases by 1. So after turn 0, life span becomes 9; after turn 1, 8, and so on, until after turn 9, life span becomes 1; after turn 10, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So the food is present during turns when life span is >=1, so from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive, it can be eaten. At turn 10, if life span was 1, after the turn it becomes 0, so during turn 10, it is not present? I think it's ambiguous.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nTypically, at the beginning of turn t, the food is there with life span L. After the turn, if it was not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If after decrease it is 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food with life span 10 at turn 0: at start of turn 0, life span 10. If not eaten during turn 0, at end of turn 0, life span decreases to 9. Similarly, at start of turn 1, life span 9, etc. At start of turn 9, life span 1; if not eaten during turn 9, at end, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not available at turn 10.\n\nSo food can be eaten on turns from 0 to 9 for this case.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut all have life span 10, so I have until turn 9 to eat them.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nLet's consider the two options for turn 0.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,2) at turn 0, eat food, score+1, length 2, positions [(3,2), (3,3)], dir D.\n\nThen at turn 1, move D to (3,1), eat food, score+1, length 3, positions [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)], dir D.\n\nNow turn 2, from (3,1), dir D. Possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,2) but occupied by body, collision.\n\n- D: (3,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (2,1) free\n\n- R: (4,1) free\n\nSo can move L or R.\n\nSay I move L to (2,1), no food, so positions: head to (2,1), body: (3,1), tail: (3,2), so positions [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)], dir L.\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow turn 3, from (2,1), dir L. Possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,2) - free? x=2,y=2, no obstacle, yes.\n\n- D: (2,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (1,1) - free? x=1,y=1, not border, not obstacle (obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,1) free)\n\n- R: not allowed, opposite to L.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\nIf move L to (1,1), no food, positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), tail (3,1), so [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1)], dir L.\n\nNow I need to get to (1,6) for the food.\n\nFrom (1,1), dir L, but x=1, and I can move U or D, but not R.\n\nU to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle, wall.\n\nD to (1,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL: but x=1, L would be x=0, which is border wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U, but (1,2) is wall, so no move possible? Dead end.\n\nAt (1,1), only move U to (1,2), but (1,2) is wall, so I cannot move, collision with wall. Game over.\n\nOh no! If I go to (1,1), I'm trapped.\n\nFrom (2,1), instead of moving L to (1,1), I could move U to (2,2).\n\nAt turn 3, from (2,1) dir L, move U to (2,2), no food, positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1)? Positions before: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove U to (2,2), no eat, new positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1)? New positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) ] and (3,2) freed, so tail at (3,1).\n\nDir U.\n\nThen from (2,2), dir U, possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but occupied or reverse? Dir U, so D is opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (3,2) free? (3,2) is now free, since tail moved.\n\nBut R is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nU to (2,3) free? y=3, x=2, no obstacle.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move U to (2,3), no food, positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (2,1), so [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)], dir U.\n\nThen I can continue, but I need to get to (1,6), but from here, I have to go left, but at x=1, y=3 is free, (1,3) not obstacle.\n\nFrom (2,3), dir U, I can move L to (1,3) or U to (2,4) etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, and obstacles at (1,4), (1,5), so between y=3 and y=6, at x=1, y=4 and y=5 are walls, so I cannot go directly from (1,3) to (1,6), because (1,4) and (1,5) block.\n\nI have to go around, but the grid has obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), so at x=1, only y=1,3,6 are free, but y=1 and y=6 are separated.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move U to (1,4) but wall, or D to (1,2) wall, so only L or R, but L invalid, R to (2,3) which might be occupied or not.\n\nIf I'm at (1,3), I can only move to other directions, but U and D blocked by walls at adjacent cells, so I can move R to (2,3).\n\nBut then I'm stuck at x=2 or need to go up.\n\nThe area around (1,6) is blocked except at y=6.\n\n(1,6) can be accessed from left or right, but left is wall, so from right (2,6), or up/down but y=6, up to y=7 wall, down to y=5 but (1,5) wall, so only from (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) must be free.\n\n(2,6) x=2,y=6, not border, obstacles: no (2,6) listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6), etc.\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I need to go to (2,6) then L to (1,6).\n\nBut from my current position after eating the two foods, I'm at bottom, and need to go up to y=6.\n\nBut with the body, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps it's better not to eat the two foods first, because it might trap me or make it hard to reach (1,6).\n\nOption 2 at turn 0: move L to (2,3), no eat, length 1, head at (2,3), dir L.\n\nThen I can go towards (1,6).\n\nFrom (2,3), dir L, possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3).\n\nAll possible? (2,4) free, (2,2) free, (1,3) free.\n\nFood at (1,6), so I can move L to (1,3) at turn 1, for example.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), no eat, positions [(2,3)], dir L.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3), no food, positions [(1,3)], dir L. (since moved left, direction L)\n\nNow at (1,3), dir L, but x=1, L to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, wall.\n\nD to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (2,3) free, but R is opposite to current direction L? Direction is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves are U, D, L, but U and D blocked, L invalid, so no move, trapped at (1,3). Game over.\n\nOh, so moving directly to (1,3) is bad.\n\nFrom (2,3), I should not move L to (1,3), but move U or D first.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, from (2,3) dir L, move U to (2,4).\n\nNo food, positions [(2,4)], dir U.\n\nThen from (2,4), dir U, can move U to (2,5), D to (2,3) but opposite not allowed, L to (1,4) wall, R to (3,4) but (3,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\nSo only U to (2,5), free? (2,5) not obstacle.\n\nMove U to (2,5), positions [(2,5)], dir U.\n\nThen at (2,5), dir U, can move U to (2,6), D not allowed, L to (1,5) wall, R to (3,5) free? (3,5) not listed obstacle.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nMove U to (2,6), no food, positions [(2,6)], dir U.\n\nThen at (2,6), dir U, U to (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D not allowed; L to (1,6) which has food; R to (3,6) free.\n\nL to (1,6) is possible, and not opposite, perpendicular.\n\nMove L to (1,6), eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(1,6), (2,6)], dir L.\n\nThen I have eaten (1,6), score +1.\n\nNow I need to eat the other foods at (3,2) and (3,1).\n\nBut they are at bottom, and I'm at top.\n\nAlso, life span 10, so I have time, but I need to go down.\n\nFrom (1,6), dir L, but x=1, L to (0,6) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (1,7) y=7 wall.\n\nD to (1,5) but (1,5) wall, obstacle.\n\nR to (2,6) but occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo only possible moves are U, D, L, R but all invalid except R, but R to (2,6) is body, collision.\n\nHead at (1,6), body at (2,6), so (2,6) is occupied.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (1,7) wall\n\n- D: (1,5) wall\n\n- L: (0,6) wall\n\n- R: (2,6) body, collision\n\nNo valid move, game over! Because after eating, I'm stuck.\n\nThe problem is that (1,6) is at the edge with walls around.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to approach from the right, so that after eating, I can move right or other directions.\n\nIn the above, I approached from (2,6) by moving left to (1,6), so after eating, head at (1,6), body at (2,6), and I can only move R, but (2,6) is body, so collision.\n\nI should have approached from below or above, but above is wall, below is wall at (1,5), so only from right.\n\nBut when I move left to eat, the body is behind me, so (2,6) is occupied.\n\nTo avoid collision, I need to move in such a way that after eating, the body is not blocking the only exit.\n\nFor (1,6), since it's at corner, I need to have the body not on the only free cell.\n\nBut the only free adjacent cell is (2,6), so if I move to (1,6) from (2,6), the body will be at (2,6), so I collide if I try to move back.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,6) without dying immediately after, because there's no space to move.\n\nLet's list adjacent cells to (1,6):\n\n- Up: (1,7) y=7 wall\n\n- Down: (1,5) internal obstacle wall\n\n- Left: (0,6) x=0 wall\n\n- Right: (2,6) free\n\nSo only one adjacent cell: (2,6)\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,6), I must move from (2,6) to (1,6). After eating, head at (1,6), and since I grew, the body includes the previous position, which is (2,6), so (2,6) is occupied by body. Then, from (1,6), I can only move to (2,6), but it's occupied, so collision. Game over.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,6) because it leads to immediate death. The only way to access it is from (2,6), but after eating, (2,6) is body and I have to move there.\n\nUnless I have no body, but I start with length 1, but when I eat, I grow to length 2, so always have body after eating.\n\nIf I eat with length 1, I grow to 2, so body is the previous head position.\n\nFor (1,6), since it has only one access point, eating it causes death.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat (1,6) at all. It's a trap food.\n\nSimilarly, in the first option, if I eat the other foods, I might be able to survive.\n\nBut (1,6) has value 1, but eating it kills me, so I should avoid it.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nBut in this case, for (1,6), the issue is not tail reward danger, but the fact that after eating, I'm trapped with no move.\n\nTail reward danger is specific to when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here, when I eat, the tail is not adjacent in that way; it's just that the only exit is blocked by the new body.\n\nBut in this case, since only one cell, it's similar.\n\nBut formally, tail reward danger requires the head to be adjacent to the tail before eating, and the tail cell has food.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (1,6) from (2,6), before moving, head at (2,6), tail at? If I was length 1, no tail, but when I move to eat, I grow.\n\nSuppose I am at (2,6) with length 1, positions [(2,6)], dir say R or whatever.\n\nThen I move L to (1,6) to eat. Before move, head at (2,6), no body, no tail. After moving to (1,6) and eating, new positions [(1,6), (2,6)], length 2. Now from (1,6), I need to move, but only possible move is to (2,6), which is now body, so collision. Death.\n\nIf I have body, it's worse.\n\nSo indeed, (1,6) cannot be eaten safely; it always leads to death.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (1,6) and only go for the other foods.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) and (3,1) are safe to eat, as long as I don't get trapped.\n\nAlso, there might be other foods later, but for now, only these.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), eat, then D to (3,1), eat, then I'm at (3,1) with body at (3,2) and (3,3), length 3.\n\nThen I need to move left or right to avoid being trapped.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,1) as before.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nAfter eating both at (3,2) and (3,1), at turn 2, head at (3,1), dir D.\n\nMove L to (2,1), no eat, positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)], dir L. (since moved left)\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow turn 3, from (2,1), dir L, move U to (2,2), no food, positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1), so [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)], dir U.\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,2), dir U, move U to (2,3), no food, positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail (2,1), [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)], dir U.\n\nNow at (2,3), I can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free, but let's see.\n\n(3,3) was previous position, but now free.\n\nMove R to (3,3), no food, positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), tail (2,2), [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2)], dir R.\n\nThen I can go up or down, but (3,4) is wall, so move U to (3,4) invalid, D to (3,2) free, L to (2,3) body? (2,3) is body now, so collision if move L.\n\nFrom (3,3), dir R, possible moves: U to (3,4) wall, D to (3,2) free, L to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied, collision, R to (4,3) free.\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nMove D to (3,2), but (3,2) is where tail was, but now free, no food, so positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), tail (2,3), [(3,2), (3,3), (2,3)], dir D.\n\nBut I have been moving without eating, and the foods are still there, but I need to eat them or other.\n\n(3,2) had food, but I ate it already at turn 0, so no food there now.\n\nFoods are (3,1), (3,2), (1,6), but (3,2) eaten, (3,1) eaten, (1,6) to be avoided, so no food left? But life span 10, so if not eaten, they disappear after some turns, but since I ate (3,2) and (3,1), only (1,6) is there, but I should not eat it.\n\nSo after eating both, I can just roam around.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should eat if possible, but no other food.\n\nWith the obstacles, the grid has limited space.\n\nFor example, from here, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut since (1,6) is not eatable, I should avoid it.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0.\n\nI need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince (1,6) is a trap, I should go for the other two foods.\n\nAt turn 0, move D to (3,2), eat food.\n\nThen turn 1, move D to (3,1), eat food.\n\nThen turn 2, from (3,1), dir D, move L to (2,1), no eat.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,1), dir L, move U to (2,2), no eat.\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,2), dir U, move U to (2,3), no eat.\n\nThat's 5 turns: turns 0 to 4.\n\nBut I need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, after that, I can continue, but for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for those turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it's \\boxed{ Turn 0: action, Turn 1: action, ... } so I need to list the sequence.\n\nSince the snake is short, and after eating, I can move freely.\n\nTo be safe, at turn 2, instead of moving left, I could move right to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,1) dir D, move R to (4,1), no food, positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2), [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)], dir R.\n\nThen I can explore the right side.\n\nBut similar.\n\nNow, since I must avoid (1,6), and it's not eatable, I should not go there.\n\nIn the initial move, if I move L at turn 0, I might go to areas where I can find other foods, but no other foods are listed, only these three.\n\nSo only two foods to eat.\n\nSo best to eat both and then survive.\n\nNow for the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), eat food.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), eat food. Now length 3.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,1) dir D, move L to (2,1), no eat. Positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)], dir L.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1) dir L, move U to (2,2), no eat. Positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)], dir U.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2) dir U, move U to (2,3), no eat. Positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)], dir U.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nI could move to other directions, but this seems fine.\n\nSince head direction matters for reverse, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAt turn 2, I could move R instead, but left is also ok.\n\nTo make it consistent.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 0, if I move L first, I might be able to do something else, but I think moving D to eat is better to get the score.\n\nAnd (1,6) is not feasible.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nFinal decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 0):**\n- Snake position: Head at (3,3), length 1 (no body segments).\n- Head direction: Left (L).\n- Food:\n  - (3,1): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 10 if not eaten).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 10.\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 10.\n- Walls: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n1. **Food at (1,6) is a death trap**: \n   - (1,6) has only one accessible adjacent cell: (2,6). Moving left from (2,6) to eat it would place the head at (1,6) and the new body segment at (2,6). From (1,6), the only possible move is right to (2,6), which is occupied by the body, causing immediate collision. Thus, eating (1,6) is impossible without dying, so it must be avoided entirely.\n2. **Food at (3,2) and (3,1) are safe and valuable**: \n   - Both are positive food (+1 each). Eating them increases length and score. They are close to the starting position and can be eaten quickly without significant risk.\n3. **Movement constraints**: \n   - Current head direction is L, so reverse move (R) is not allowed on turn 0.\n   - After eating, the snake grows, requiring careful pathing to avoid collisions with walls or body segments.\n4. **Life span**: All food has life span 10, meaning they disappear after turn 10. However, (1,6) is not eatable, so focus is on (3,2) and (3,1), which can be eaten by turn 1.\n5. **Long-term survival**: After eating both foods, the snake must navigate to open areas to avoid dead ends. The grid has obstacles, so the path must steer clear of risky zones like the left wall (x=1, where y=2,4,5 are walls).\n\n**5+ Turn Plan:**\n- **Turn 0-1**: Eat (3,2) and (3,1) immediately to secure +2 score. This grows the snake to length 3.\n- **Turn 2-4**: Move left then up to position the snake safely in open space (toward (2,3)), avoiding obstacles and walls.\n- **Beyond Turn 4**: Continue exploring open areas (e.g., toward (3,3) or (4,3)) to maximize survival and potential future food spawns. (1,6) is ignored as it is a trap.\n- **Path Safety**: \n  - After eating, moving left to (2,1) avoids immediate traps. \n  - Moving up to (2,2) and (2,3) keeps the snake in the central-left area, which has fewer obstacles and more movement options.\n  - All moves comply with direction constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 0-4):**\n- **Turn 0**: Move D (down) to (3,2) – Eat food, grow to length 2, score +1. Head now at (3,2), direction D.\n- **Turn 1**: Move D (down) to (3,1) – Eat food, grow to length 3, score +1 (total score +2). Head at (3,1), direction D.\n- **Turn 2**: Move L (left) to (2,1) – No food, head at (2,1), direction L. Body segments at (3,1) and (3,2).\n- **Turn 3**: Move U (up) to (2,2) – No food, head at (2,2), direction U. Body segments at (2,1) and (3,1).\n- **Turn 4**: Move U (up) to (2,3) – No food, head at (2,3), direction U. Body segments at (2,2) and (2,1).\n\n**State After Turn 4:**\n- Snake positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)] (head at (2,3), tail at (2,1)).\n- Head direction: U.\n- Food remaining: (1,6) – Should be avoided as it is a death trap; it will expire unused.\n- Next moves (beyond turn 4): From (2,3), possible moves include U (to (2,4)), R (to (3,3)), or D (but D is reverse, not allowed). Move U or R to explore safely.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating both safe foods early and ensures long-term survival by moving to open areas. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms no risks in the sequence, and the snake can continue indefinitely in the available space.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: D \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: L \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. The current turn is t=2.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I need to avoid these.\n\nSnake positions: only [(2,2)], so the snake is just the head at (2,2). That means it's length 1, no body segments yet. Head direction is down (D), so it's facing downwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so eating any will increase length by 1. Since the snake is length 1, eating food will make it grow to length 2.\n\nNow, movement options: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R). But since head direction is down, I cannot instantly reverse to up on the next turn. So from down, I can go down, left, or right, but not up immediately.\n\nCurrent position: (2,2), head direction D.\n\nPossible moves from here:\n\n- Down (D): to (2,1)\n\n- Left (L): to (1,2)\n\n- Right (R): to (3,2)\n\nCannot go up because that would be reverse direction.\n\nNow, check for walls or obstacles:\n\n- Down to (2,1): y=1 is within 1 to 6? Grid is from 0 to 7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not a wall. x=2, y=1. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,1) is not in the obstacle list, so it should be safe.\n\n(2,1): x=2, y=1. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,1) is not a border wall. Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). None match (2,1), so (2,1) is empty.\n\n- Left to (1,2): x=1, y=2. Now, (1,2) is in the obstacle list: (1,2) is listed as an internal obstacle. So I cannot move there; it's blocked.\n\nObstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)] – yes, (1,2) is an obstacle, so moving left to (1,2) is not possible.\n\n- Right to (3,2): x=3, y=2. Is this a wall or obstacle? Border: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=3 is fine. y=2 fine. Obstacles: (3,4) is there, but (3,2) not listed, so it should be safe.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,2):\n\n- D to (2,1) – empty\n\n- L to (1,2) – blocked, cannot go\n\n- R to (3,2) – has food\n\nSince L is blocked, only D and R are possible actions for turn t=2.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their positions:\n\n- (3,1): value 1, life span 8\n\n- (3,2): value 1, life span 8\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 8\n\n- (6,3): value 1, life span 9\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn t=2, life span decreases to 7 for the first three? Let's see.\n\nLife span is given as the remaining life at the start of turn t=2. So for (3,1), life span 8 means it has 8 turns left including this turn, so after this turn, it will have 7, and so on. Similarly for others.\n\nSince we're at turn 2, after each move, life span decreases.\n\nBut for planning, I need to consider when food disappears.\n\nAlso, since snake is only head, no body, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, for turn t=2, actions: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), I eat the food there. Since snake is length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2. New position: head at (3,2), and tail at (2,2)? When snake moves, if it eats, it grows, so positions become [(3,2), (2,2)] for the next turn.\n\nSnake positions after eating: head moves to new position, and since it ate, length increases, so the tail doesn't move away yet. For a snake of length 1, after eating and moving to new cell, the body consists of the previous head position.\n\nInitial: positions [(2,2)]\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) and eating: since value is +1, length increases to 2, so new positions: head at (3,2), and body segment at (2,2). So [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead direction: if I move right, new direction is R.\n\nIf I move down to (2,1), no food there, so snake remains length 1, head at (2,1), direction D if I move down.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, consider moving right to (3,2) and eating the food.\n\nTurn t=2: move R to (3,2), eat food, score +1, snake now [(3,2), (2,2)], head direction R.\n\nNow, at turn t=3, I need to move from (3,2).\n\nPossible moves: from (3,2), head direction R, so I can move R, U, D, but not L (left, opposite of right).\n\n- Right (R) to (4,2)\n\n- Up (U) to (3,3)\n\n- Down (D) to (3,1)\n\n- Left (L) not possible, reverse.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- (4,2): x=4,y=2. Walls? x=4 not border, y=2 not border. Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so should be empty.\n\n- (3,3): x=3,y=3. Empty? Obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, so empty.\n\n- (3,1): x=3,y=1. There is food at (3,1) with value 1. Also, no obstacle, walls fine.\n\nAlso, at (3,1), food is present.\n\nNow, after turn t=2, life spans decrease: all food had life span 8 at start of t=2, so after t=2, life span 7 for (3,1), (3,2), (1,6); (3,2) was eaten, so removed. (6,3) had life span 9, so after t=2, 8 left.\n\nFood eaten at t=2: (3,2) gone.\n\nRemaining food:\n\n- (3,1): life span 7 (after t=2)\n\n- (1,6): life span 7\n\n- (6,3): life span 8\n\nAt turn t=3, from (3,2), I can move to (4,2), (3,3), or (3,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), I can eat that food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a risk: if I eat at (3,1), snake grows to length 3, positions: head to (3,1), body: (3,2) and (2,2). So [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead direction down if I move down to (3,1).\n\nBut at (3,1), it's the head position, and body is at (3,2) and (2,2).\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut I should consider other moves.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both foods close together if it traps me.\n\nSince the snake is small, I have space.\n\nNow, another option: at t=2, move down to (2,1) instead.\n\nTurn t=2: move D to (2,1), no food, so snake still [(2,1)], head direction D (since I moved down).\n\nThen at turn t=3, from (2,1), head direction D, can move D, L, R, not U.\n\n- Down (D) to (2,0) – but y=0 is wall, so cannot move there. Border wall.\n\n- Left (L) to (1,1)\n\n- Right (R) to (3,1)\n\nCannot go up, reverse.\n\nNow, (1,1): x=1,y=1. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,1) not border. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,1) not listed, so should be empty.\n\n(3,1): has food, and no obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,1) at t=3: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I go R to (3,1), eat food, snake becomes [(3,1), (2,1)] length 2.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nBack to planning from t=2.\n\nI need to simulate multiple steps.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, and internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n\nFood: (3,1), (3,2), (1,6), (6,3) but (3,2) will be eaten if I go there at t=2.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\n(6,3) at x=6,y=3.\n\nNow, since I must think 5 turns ahead, let's consider the two choices at t=2.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (3,2) at t=2, eat food.\n\nThen snake: [(3,2), (2,2)] head dir R at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, from (3,2), I can:\n\n- Go R to (4,2)\n\n- Go U to (3,3)\n\n- Go D to (3,1) and eat food there\n\nIf I go to (3,1), eat, then snake: head (3,1), body (3,2), (2,2) so [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] head dir D.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,1), head dir D, can move D, L, R? Dir is down, so cannot go up.\n\n- Down to (3,0) but y=0 wall, cannot.\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Right to (4,1)\n\n(2,1): empty? Yes.\n\n(4,1): empty? Obstacles, (4,4) but not (4,1), so empty.\n\nAlso, no food at (2,1) or (4,1), food is at (1,6) and (6,3).\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), tail at (2,2)? Positions: after moving from (3,1) to (2,1), no eat, so head moves to (2,1), tail moves away from (2,2) to? Snake moves, head to new position, tail segment removed unless eating.\n\nAt t=3, snake is [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] after eating at (3,1).\n\nThen at t=4, if I move to (2,1), since no food there, snake moves: head to (2,1), and tail from (2,2) is removed, so positions become [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n\nAfter t=3: positions [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] head at (3,1).\n\nAt t=4, move to (2,1): no food, so new head at (2,1), then body: the first body segment was at (3,2), now moves to where head was, (3,1). Second body segment at (2,2) moves to where the first body was, (3,2). Then tail at (2,2) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,1), then body segments: (3,1) and (3,2)? Order: the segment that was behind head moves to head's old position.\n\nPositions list: index 0 head, 1,2,... tail.\n\nAt t=3: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] so head (3,1), body1 (3,2), body2/tail (2,2)\n\nMove to (2,1): new head position (2,1). Then body1 moves to old head position (3,1). Body2 moves to old body1 position (3,2). Then since no growth, tail (2,2) is not part of snake anymore; it moves away.\n\nSo new snake: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] with head at (2,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nHead direction: moved left from (3,1) to (2,1), so head dir L.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved right to (4,1), head dir R.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,1) at t=4, moving to (2,1) or (4,1) both possible.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nBack to t=3 after eating at (3,2) on t=2.\n\nFrom (3,2), I could go to (4,2) or (3,3) instead of (3,1).\n\nFor example, go to (4,2) at t=3.\n\n(4,2) is empty, no food.\n\nThen snake: after t=2, [(3,2),(2,2)] head dir R.\n\nMove to (4,2) at t=3, no eat, so new positions: head (4,2), body moves to (3,2), tail (2,2) removed. So snake [(4,2), (3,2)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=4, from (4,2), head dir R, can move R, U, D.\n\n- R to (5,2)\n\n- U to (4,3)\n\n- D to (4,1)\n\nCannot L.\n\nNow, (5,2): but (5,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n\n(4,3): empty? Obstacles (4,4) but (4,3) not, so empty.\n\n(4,1): empty, as before.\n\nAlso, food at (6,3) and (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2) at t=3, I could go up to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) empty, no food.\n\nMove to (3,3), snake becomes [(3,3), (3,2)] head dir U (if moved up).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut I need to consider the food life spans.\n\nFood at (3,1) has life span 7 after t=2, so it will disappear after 7 more turns, but since we're at turn-based, after t=2, life 7, so it exists until turn t=2 + 7 -1? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span at start of turn: at turn t=2, life span is 8 for (3,1), meaning it will disappear after 8 turns from now, or at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0.\n\nTypically, life span decreases at the end of the turn or start?\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", so at start of turn, if life span is L, it has L turns left including this turn. After this turn, it has L-1 left, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nTo be precise: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. During the turn, if snake moves to it, it can be eaten. At the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, food disappears before the next turn.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nAt t=2, food (3,1) has life span 8, so it will be present for turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? After t=2, life span 7, so present until after turn when it decreases to 0.\n\nStart of t=2: life 8\n\nAfter t=2: life 7\n\nAfter t=3: life 6\n\n...\n\nAfter t=9: life 0, disappears before t=10.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life 8 at t=2, so disappears after turn t=9 (since after t=9, life 0).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nAt start t=2: life 8\n\nAfter t=2 (end of turn): life 7\n\nAfter t=3: life 6\n\n...\n\nAfter t=8: life 1\n\nAfter t=9: life 0, disappears, so not present at t=10.\n\nIt is present during turns when life >=1, and can be eaten during that turn.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) at t=2, life 8, but if eaten at t=2, it's gone.\n\n(1,6) life 8 at t=2, so present until after t=9.\n\n(6,3) life 9 at t=2, so present until after t=10, disappears before t=11.\n\nLife 9 at t=2, after t=2:8, t=3:7, ..., after t=10:0, disappear before t=11.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt t=2, if I move right to (3,2), I eat one food, but (3,1) is adjacent and can be eaten next turn.\n\nBut eating both might not be good for long-term, as the snake grows and might be trapped.\n\nWith the obstacles, let's see the map.\n\nLet me draw a simple grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, but some have obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n\nAlso, food: (3,1), (3,2), (1,6), (6,3)\n\nSnake at (2,2) head down.\n\nNow, if I go right to (3,2) at t=2, eat, snake becomes [(3,2),(2,2)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=3, I can:\n\n- Go down to (3,1) and eat the food there. Then snake [(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)] dir D.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1) or right to (4,1), since down to (3,0) wall, up not possible dir D.\n\nIf go left to (2,1), then as before, snake moves to [(2,1),(3,1),(3,2)] dir L.\n\nThen at t=5, from (2,1), dir L, can go L to (1,1), or D to (2,0) wall, or U to (2,2) but (2,2) is not there anymore? Positions at t=4: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove from (2,1) to (1,1): (1,1) is empty, no obstacle, no food. So move to (1,1), no eat, snake becomes [(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)] dir L (since moved left).\n\nThen at t=6, from (1,1), dir L, can go L to (0,1) but x=0 wall, cannot; U to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there; D to (1,0) wall, cannot. So only possible right to (2,1)? But (2,1) is the body position.\n\nAt t=5, snake is at [(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)] head at (1,1), body at (2,1), tail at (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,1), with dir L (since last move left to here), so possible moves: left not possible (wall), up not possible (obstacle at (1,2)), down not possible (wall), right to (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by body! So collision.\n\nIf I go to (2,1) from (1,1), (2,1) is the position of the first body segment, so head moving there would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, at t=6, from (1,1), I have no safe move! All directions blocked or occupied.\n\nSo this path leads to death at t=6 if I eat both (3,2) and (3,1) and then move to (2,1) and (1,1).\n\nIn this sequence, after eating both, I ended up trapped.\n\nIf at t=4 from (3,1), I go right to (4,1) instead.\n\nAt t=3, after eating (3,2), I am at (3,2), and I go down to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,1), dir D, I can go right to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) empty, no food. Move to (4,1), no eat, snake: head (4,1), body moves to (3,1), tail to (3,2)? Positions: after t=3: [(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nMove to (4,1): new head (4,1), body1 moves to old head (3,1), body2 moves to old body1 (3,2), tail (2,2) removed. So snake [(4,1),(3,1),(3,2)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=5, from (4,1), dir R, can go R to (5,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, not L.\n\n(5,1): empty? Obstacles (5,2) and (5,5), (6,1), but (5,1) not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,2): empty, as before.\n\nSay go R to (5,1), then snake moves to [(5,1),(4,1),(3,1)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=6, from (5,1), dir R, can go R to (6,1), but (6,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (6,1), so cannot.\n\nU to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (5,0) wall, cannot.\n\nOnly left to (4,1), but (4,1) is body, collision.\n\nSo again, trapped at t=6.\n\nIf at t=5 from (4,1), I go up to (4,2) instead.\n\n(4,2) empty, no food.\n\nMove to (4,2), snake becomes [(4,2),(4,1),(3,1)] head dir U.\n\nThen at t=6, from (4,2), dir U, can go U to (4,3), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2) obstacle, not D.\n\n(4,3): empty.\n\n(3,2): but (3,2) is where the tail was? Positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), tail (3,1). (3,2) is empty now.\n\n(3,2) was part of snake earlier, but after moving, it's free.\n\nMove to (3,2): possible, since empty.\n\nThen snake: new head (3,2), body moves to (4,2), then to (4,1), tail (3,1) removed? After move to (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), body1 to old head (4,2), body2 to old body1 (4,1), and tail (3,1) removed, so snake [(3,2),(4,2),(4,1)] head dir L (since moved left from (4,2)).\n\nThen I can continue, but I need to reach other food.\n\nBut this seems messy, and I have food at (1,6) and (6,3) to consider.\n\nPerhaps eating both (3,2) and (3,1) early is risky because of the obstacles nearby.\n\nNow, back to t=2, if I move down to (2,1) instead.\n\nTurn t=2: move D to (2,1), no eat, snake still [(2,1)] head dir D.\n\nThen at t=3, from (2,1), dir D, can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), since down wall.\n\nIf I go R to (3,1), eat food, snake becomes [(3,1),(2,1)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,1), dir R, can go R to (4,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, not L.\n\n(4,1) empty, (3,2) has no food now? (3,2) was eaten at t=2? No, in this scenario, I didn't eat (3,2), only moving to (3,1) at t=3.\n\nFood: at t=2, I moved down, so (3,2) still there, life span after t=2: 7 for (3,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nAfter t=2, food life: (3,1) life 7, (3,2) life 7, (1,6) life 7, (6,3) life 8.\n\nAt t=3, from (2,1), I move R to (3,1), eat (3,1), so (3,1) gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,1),(2,1)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,1), dir R, can go to (4,1) or (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food! (3,2) is still there with life 7, now 6 after t=3? At start t=3, life 7 for (3,2), after t=3, life 6.\n\nSo I can go to (3,2) and eat.\n\nMove to (3,2), eat, snake grows: head to (3,2), body: (3,1) and (2,1), so [(3,2),(3,1),(2,1)] head dir U (if moved up from (3,1) to (3,2)? From (3,1) to (3,2) is up, so dir U.\n\nThen similar to before, I might be trapped.\n\nGo to (4,1) instead.\n\nFrom (3,1) at t=4, go to (4,1), no eat, snake: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (2,1) removed? Positions after t=3: [(3,1),(2,1)] head (3,1), tail (2,1)\n\nMove to (4,1): new head (4,1), body moves to (3,1), tail (2,1) removed, so snake [(4,1),(3,1)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=5, from (4,1), dir R, go to (5,1) or (4,2) or (4,0) wall.\n\n(5,1) empty, (4,2) empty.\n\nSay go to (4,2), then snake [(4,2),(4,1)] head dir U.\n\nThen at t=6, from (4,2), can go U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) obstacle, not D.\n\n(4,3) empty, (3,2) has food if still there.\n\nBut (3,2) life span, at t=4, after t=4, life 5 for (3,2)? Start t=4, life 6 for (3,2) after previous decreases.\n\nStart t=2: (3,2) life 8\n\nAfter t=2: life 7\n\nStart t=3: life 7\n\nAfter t=3: life 6\n\nStart t=4: life 6\n\nAfter t=4: life 5\n\netc.\n\nSo at t=6, (3,2) still there with life 4 or something.\n\nBut I can go to (3,2) from (4,2) at t=6, but let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the trap.\n\nAt t=2, moving down to (2,1) might be better because I don't eat immediately, and I can access other areas.\n\nLet's consider the food at (1,6) and (6,3).\n\n(1,6) is at top left, (6,3) bottom right.\n\nWith obstacles, it might be hard to reach.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,6), from (2,2), I need to go left and up, but left to (1,2) is blocked, so I have to go around.\n\nPossible path: from (2,2), go down to (2,1), then left to (1,1), then up to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so cannot go directly up from (1,1).\n\nFrom (1,1), I can only go right or down, but down to (1,0) wall, so only right to (2,1), which is body if snake is long.\n\nWith short snake, from (1,1), I can go up only if (1,2) free, but it's not, so (1,1) is a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,6), I need to go via other cells.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go up, but head dir down, so at t=2 I cannot go up, reverse.\n\nAt t=2, only D or R.\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), then from there I can go up to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut with obstacles, let's list free cells.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=6: x=1 to 6, but (1,6) food, (1,5) obstacle, (1,4) obstacle, so row y=6, x=1 free for (1,6), but x=1,y=5 and y=4 obstacles, so to reach (1,6), I need to come from above or below, but y=7 wall, so from below, but (1,5) and (1,4) blocked, so I can only reach (1,6) from (1,3) or (1,7) but y=7 wall, so from (1,3) to (1,4) blocked, so (1,6) is almost isolated.\n\n(1,6) at x=1,y=6.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,5) obstacle, (1,7) wall, (0,6) wall, (2,6) possible.\n\n(2,6) is free, no obstacle.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go to (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) can be reached from (2,5) or (2,7) wall, or (3,6), etc.\n\nSo (1,6) is reachable via (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) at x=6,y=3, adjacent to (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,2) free? Obstacles (6,1) at (6,1), but (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\n(6,4) free, (5,3) free.\n\nBut (6,1) obstacle, so (6,2) is free.\n\nSo (6,3) accessible.\n\nNow, life spans: (1,6) life 8 at t=2, so lasts until after t=9.\n\n(6,3) life 9 at t=2, lasts until after t=10.\n\n(3,1) and (3,2) last until after t=9.\n\nBut (3,2) might be eaten early.\n\nAt t=2, if I move down to (2,1), I can then at t=3 move to (3,1) to eat or to (1,1).\n\nIf I go to (1,1) at t=3, from (2,1) move L to (1,1), no eat, snake [(1,1)] head dir L.\n\nThen at t=4, from (1,1), dir L, can only go right to (2,1), but (2,1) is where I came from? At t=3, snake was at (2,1), moved to (1,1), so at t=4, positions: head at (1,1), no body, length 1.\n\nMove to (2,1): possible, since no body, (2,1) empty.\n\nThen I oscillate between (1,1) and (2,1), but that doesn't achieve anything.\n\nSo better to go to (3,1) at t=3.\n\nBut as before, eating (3,1) then I might be forced to eat (3,2) or move away.\n\nTo avoid the trap, at t=2, move down to (2,1), then at t=3, move to (3,1) and eat, snake [(3,1),(2,1)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=4, instead of going to (3,2), I go to (4,1), so I move away from (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) go R to (4,1), no eat, snake [(4,1),(3,1)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=5, from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nSay go U to (4,2), snake [(4,2),(4,1)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=6, from (4,2), go U to (4,3), snake [(4,3),(4,2)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=7, from (4,3), go U to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D not possible dir U.\n\n(3,3) empty, (5,3) empty.\n\nSay go to (3,3), snake [(3,3),(4,3)] dir L.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2) if food still there, or to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) food might expire soon.\n\nLife of (3,2): start t=2 life 8, after t=2:7, t=3:6, t=4:5, t=5:4, t=6:3, t=7:2, after t=7 life 1, after t=8 life 0, disappear before t=9.\n\nSo at t=7, life 2, so can be eaten at t=7 or t=8.\n\nSimilarly, I need to get to (1,6) or (6,3).\n\n(1,6) at (1,6), can be reached from (2,6).\n\nFrom current position, I am at (3,3) at t=7, then I can go up to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, cannot; so go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or down to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, so I can go down to (3,2) at t=8 if life span allows.\n\nBut let's not plan that far.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should go towards (1,6) or (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has longer life, life 9 at t=2, so after t=10 disappear.\n\n(1,6) life 8 at t=2, after t=9 disappear.\n\nAt turn t=2, moving down to (2,1) seems better because it opens the path to the bottom or left.\n\nIf I move right to (3,2) at t=2, I eat one food, but then I am at (3,2), and (3,1) is below, which might tempt me to eat it and get trapped.\n\nBut I can choose not to eat (3,1) and move elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) at t=3, go up to (3,3) instead of down.\n\nThen at (3,3), no food, snake [(3,3),(3,2)] head dir U.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,3), dir U, can go U to (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D not possible.\n\n(2,3) empty, (4,3) empty.\n\nSay go L to (2,3), snake [(2,3),(3,3)] dir L.\n\nThen at t=5, from (2,3), dir L, can go L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), not R.\n\n(1,3): empty? Obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) not listed, so empty.\n\n(2,4): empty? Obstacles, (1,4) but not (2,4), so empty.\n\n(2,2): but (2,2) is where tail was? At t=4, snake [(2,3),(3,3)], tail at (3,3), so (2,2) empty.\n\n(2,2) is free.\n\nSo I can go to (1,3) or (2,4) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then snake [(1,3),(2,3)] dir L.\n\nThen at t=6, from (1,3), dir L, can go L to (0,3) wall, U to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, D to (1,2) obstacle, so only right to (2,3), which is body, collision.\n\nTrapped.\n\nGo to (2,4) at t=5 from (2,3).\n\nMove U to (2,4), snake [(2,4),(2,3)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=6, from (2,4), dir U, can go U to (2,5), L to (1,4) obstacle, R to (3,4) obstacle, not D.\n\n(2,5): empty? Obstacles (1,5) but (2,5) not, so empty.\n\nMove to (2,5), snake [(2,5),(2,4)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=7, from (2,5), go U to (2,6), snake [(2,6),(2,5)] dir U.\n\n(2,6) has no food, but (1,6) is adjacent.\n\nAt t=8, from (2,6), dir U, can go U to (2,7) wall, L to (1,6) food, R to (3,6), not D.\n\n(3,6) empty, or (1,6) food.\n\nI can go to (1,6) and eat.\n\nSince snake is short, [(2,6),(2,5)], length 2.\n\nMove to (1,6), eat, snake grows to length 3: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (2,5).\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen at t=9, from (1,6), dir L, can only go right to (2,6), but (2,6) is body, collision! Because body is at (2,6), and head moving to (2,6) would collide.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, at t=8, before eating, head at (2,6), tail at (2,5). (1,6) has food, and head is adjacent to (1,6), but the food is on (1,6), not on the tail cell.\n\nThe tail is at (2,5), not on (1,6).\n\nSo when I move to (1,6), I eat the food, head moves to (1,6), then since I ate, the tail grows, so new tail is at (2,5), and body at (2,6).\n\nPositions: after move and eat, head at (1,6), then body: the previous head position (2,6), and the previous tail (2,5) remains, so snake [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5)].\n\nThen at t=9, from (1,6), I can only move right to (2,6), but (2,6) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nYes, so death.\n\nIf I don't eat and go to (3,6) at t=8.\n\nFrom (2,6) at t=8, go R to (3,6), no food, snake [(3,6),(2,6)] dir R.\n\nThen I can continue, but (1,6) food might expire soon.\n\nBut I avoided death for now.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nTo avoid this, I should not be adjacent to the food when the tail is behind me in a way that causes collision.\n\nIn this case, for (1,6), to eat it safely, I need to approach from a direction that after eating, I can move away.\n\nFor example, if I approach from above or below, but y=7 wall, so only from left or right, but x=0 wall, so only from right, (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go to (1,6), and snake is longer, it might be ok if the body is not blocking.\n\nFor example, if snake is coming horizontally, head at (2,6), tail at (3,6), then move to (1,6), eat, head to (1,6), body to (2,6), tail to (3,6), then from (1,6), I can move down to (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, or up to (1,7) wall, or left to (0,6) wall, so only right to (2,6), which is body, collision. Always trapped because (1,6) has only one access.\n\n(1,6) can only be accessed from (2,6), and after eating, I can only move back to (2,6), which is body if snake is length 2 or more, so collision.\n\nIf snake is length 1, then after eating, length 2, head at (1,6), tail at previous position, say (2,6), then from (1,6), I can only move to (2,6), but (2,6) is tail, but when I move, the tail moves away, so it might be ok.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf snake is length 1 at (2,6), move to (1,6) and eat, so new snake: head at (1,6), tail at (2,6) for this turn.\n\nThen at next turn, from (1,6), I move to (2,6), but (2,6) is the tail position.\n\nWhen I move, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from its position.\n\nAt turn t, snake positions [head, tail] if length 2.\n\nAt t, head at A, tail at B.\n\nMove to C: if no eat, head to C, tail to where? Body moves to previous head position, so new head C, new tail A, but since length 2, positions [C, A].\n\nIf eat, head to C, tail stays, so [C, A, B] for length 3.\n\nFor (1,6):\n\nCase 1: snake length 1 at (2,6), move to (1,6) eat, so new snake [(1,6), (2,6)] length 2.\n\nThen at next turn, from (1,6), I can move to (2,6), but (2,6) is the body position, so moving there causes collision with body.\n\nYes, because (2,6) is occupied by the body segment.\n\nSo I cannot move to (2,6) from (1,6) because it's my body.\n\nAnd no other moves, so death.\n\nSimilarly, if snake is longer, same issue.\n\nTherefore, (1,6) is a death trap; I cannot eat it without dying immediately after, because I have to move back to the only adjacent cell, which is where the body is.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,6) safely.\n\nIs that right?\n\nUnless the body has moved away, but in this case, after eating, the body is at (2,6), and I have to move to (2,6), which is occupied.\n\nSo yes, eating (1,6) always leads to death on the next turn because no escape.\n\nSimilarly for any food in a cell with only one access, if that access is where the body is after eating.\n\nHere, (1,6) has only one adjacent free cell: (2,6), since (1,5) obstacle, (1,7) wall, (0,6) wall.\n\nSo it's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, I should not attempt to eat (1,6); it's a trap.\n\nSimilarly, for other foods, but (3,1) and (3,2) have multiple accesses.\n\n(3,1) at x=3,y=1, adjacent: (3,0) wall, (3,2), (2,1), (4,1)\n\n(3,2) adjacent: (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\n\nAll free except walls.\n\n(6,3) adjacent: (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,2) free, (6,4) free, (5,3) free.\n\nSo no dead ends.\n\nTherefore, (1,6) should be avoided; it's not safe to eat.\n\nSo I can ignore (1,6).\n\nNow, food to target: (3,1), (3,2), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) has longer life.\n\nAt t=2, moving down to (2,1) might be better to go towards (6,3) or something.\n\nIf I move down to (2,1) at t=2, then at t=3 move to (3,1) and eat, snake [(3,1),(2,1)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=4, I can move to (4,1) to go east.\n\nFrom (3,1) go R to (4,1), no eat, snake [(4,1),(3,1)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=5, from (4,1), go R to (5,1), snake [(5,1),(4,1)] dir R.\n\n(5,1) empty.\n\nThen at t=6, from (5,1), dir R, can go R to (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, cannot; U to (5,2) obstacle, D to (5,0) wall, so only left to (4,1), body, collision. Trapped.\n\nFrom (4,1) at t=5, instead of going to (5,1), go U to (4,2), as before.\n\nThen to (4,3), etc., to reach (6,3).\n\nFrom (4,2) at t=5 (if I went there earlier), go to (4,3) at t=6, then to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, so at t=7 from (4,3), go L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is closer to (6,3).\n\nGo to (5,3), snake [(5,3),(4,3)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=8, from (5,3), dir R, can go R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) obstacle, not L.\n\n(6,3) has food, so go to (6,3) and eat.\n\nSnake: before move, [(5,3),(4,3)] length 2.\n\nMove to (6,3) eat, so new snake [(6,3),(5,3),(4,3)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=9, from (6,3), dir R, can go R to (7,3) wall, U to (6,4), D to (6,2), not L.\n\n(6,4) empty, (6,2) empty.\n\nSay go U to (6,4), then safe.\n\nSo I can eat (6,3) safely.\n\nSimilarly, I can also eat (3,1) and (3,2) if I want, but with caution.\n\nAt t=2, moving down to (2,1) allows me to go east to (6,3) without eating (3,2) immediately.\n\nIf I move right to (3,2) at t=2, I eat it, then I can go up to (3,3) etc. to reach (6,3), but it might take longer.\n\nBut since (6,3) has longer life, it's ok.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both (3,1) and (3,2) might be possible if I move away after eating one.\n\nFor example, at t=2 move R to (3,2) eat, snake [(3,2),(2,2)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=3, instead of down, go up to (3,3), no eat, snake [(3,3),(3,2)] dir U.\n\nThen at t=4, from (3,3), go R to (4,3), snake [(4,3),(3,3)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=5, from (4,3), go R to (5,3), snake [(5,3),(4,3)] dir R.\n\nThen at t=6, from (5,3), go R to (6,3) and eat, snake [(6,3),(5,3),(4,3)] head dir R.\n\nThen at t=7, from (6,3), go U to (6,4), safe.\n\nSo I ate two foods: (3,2) and (6,3), and avoided (3,1) and the trap.\n\nSimilarly, I could include (3,1) but it might not be necessary.\n\nAt t=2, moving down to (2,1), then at t=3 move to (3,1) eat, then at t=4 move to (4,1), then to (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) eat at t=8 or so.\n\nBut in the first path, by moving right at t=2, I eat (3,2) early, then go to (6,3) directly.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat two foods.\n\nBut by moving right at t=2, I eat one immediately, score +1 at t=2.\n\nBy moving down, I eat later.\n\nSince score is the same per food, it doesn't matter when I eat, as long as I eat.\n\nBut for survival, both paths seem ok.\n\nBut in the move down option, at t=2 I don't eat, so score 0 that turn.\n\nBut long-term, I can eat two.\n\nSimilarly with move right.\n\nNow, the key is to avoid risks.\n\nIn the move right option, after eating (3,2), I go up to (3,3) instead of down to (3,1), so I avoid the potential trap around (3,1).\n\nThen I can go to (6,3) safely.\n\nAlso, (3,1) will expire, but I don't care if I can eat (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,1) later if I want, but it might not be worth it.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) or something, I can go down, but it might be detour.\n\nBut with life span, (3,1) expires after t=9, so I have time, but since (6,3) is better, I can focus on that.\n\nSo at t=2, moving right to (3,2) and eating is fine, as long as I don't go down to (3,1) immediately after.\n\nI can go up.\n\nThen for the next turns, I need to output actions for 5+ turns.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turns t=2, t=3, t=4, t=5, t=6, etc., but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan and output a sequence.\n\nBut the format is to output actions for multiple turns starting from t=2.\n\nIt says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc., for several turns.\n\nBut I need to specify how many turns; probably at least 5 turns.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a path.\n\nLet's decide on a sequence.\n\nAt t=2, move right to (3,2) to eat the food.\n\nThen at t=3, from (3,2), move up to (3,3) to avoid (3,1) and go towards the right.\n\nAt t=4, from (3,3), move right to (4,3)\n\nAt t=5, from (4,3), move right to (5,3)\n\nAt t=6, from (5,3), move right to (6,3) to eat that food.\n\nThen beyond.\n\nBut at t=6, (6,3) has life span, at t=2 life 9, after t=2:8, t=3:7, t=4:6, t=5:5, t=6:4, so still present.\n\nAnd I eat at t=6.\n\nThen at t=7, from (6,3), I can move up to (6,4) or down to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide actions for t=2 to say t=6 or t=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down at t=2, I can have a similar path but eat (3,1) first.\n\nBut with move right, I eat at t=2, which is earlier.\n\nAnd I avoid the (1,6) trap.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) eat\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,3) eat\n\nAt turn 5, from (4,3) to (5,3), (5,3) is free.\n\nThen turn 6 to (6,3).\n\nAfter turn 6, I have eaten two foods.\n\nI can add more turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 turns are sufficient.\n\nThe current turn is t=2, so actions for t=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=3, I moved U to (3,3), which is valid.\n\nNow, to confirm, no instant reverse: from turn 2 move R, direction R, then turn 3 move U, not opposite, ok.\n\nThen turn 4 move R, from U to R, not opposite.\n\nTurn 5 move R, same direction or perpendicular, ok.\n\nTurn 6 move R, ok.\n\nAnd I avoided walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, for long-term, after t=6, I can explore other areas.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nIf I move down at t=2:\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,1) eat\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: U to (4,3)\n\nThen later to (5,3), (6,3) eat at t=8.\n\nBut I eat only one food by t=6, whereas in the first sequence, I eat two by t=6.\n\nIn first sequence, eat at t=2 and t=6.\n\nIn this, eat at t=3 and later.\n\nBut since score is cumulative, both can get two eventually, but first sequence gets first point earlier.\n\nBut for survival, both fine.\n\nBut in the move down option, at turn 4, I am at (4,1), then turn 5 to (4,2), turn 6 to (4,3), and (3,2) is still there, but I don't eat it.\n\nIn move right sequence, I didn't eat (3,1), which is fine.\n\nI think move right is slightly better because I eat one immediately.\n\nAnd the path is clear.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- The snake starts at (2,2) with no body segments (length 1), heading down.\n- All food is positive (+1 score, +1 length), but (1,6) is in a dead-end cell (only accessible from (2,6)) and eating it would cause immediate collision on the next turn due to the \"tail reward danger\" rule. Thus, (1,6) must be avoided entirely.\n- (3,1) and (3,2) are close but eating both risks trapping the snake near obstacles. Instead, I prioritize eating (3,2) immediately for an early score, then navigate toward (6,3), which has a longer life span (disappears after turn 10) and is safer to reach.\n- Moving down to (2,1) at turn 2 avoids immediate eating but delays scoring and may lead to inefficiencies; moving right to eat (3,2) is better for early growth and pathing east.\n- After eating (3,2), I avoid (3,1) to prevent potential traps and instead move up to (3,3), then east toward (6,3). This path avoids obstacles and walls.\n- I plan 5 turns (turns 2 to 6) to eat two foods ((3,2) and (6,3)) while ensuring survival beyond.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 2: R (right)** to (3,2) – Eat the food here for +1 score. Snake becomes [(3,2), (2,2)] with head direction R.\n- **Turn 3: U (up)** to (3,3) – Avoid moving down to (3,1) to prevent risk; no food here, so snake moves to [(3,3), (3,2)] with head direction U.\n- **Turn 4: R (right)** to (4,3) – Continue east toward (6,3); no food, so snake moves to [(4,3), (3,3)] with head direction R.\n- **Turn 5: R (right)** to (5,3) – Path toward (6,3); no food, so snake moves to [(5,3), (4,3)] with head direction R.\n- **Turn 6: R (right)** to (6,3) – Eat the food here for +1 score. Snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] with head direction R.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Score Maximization:** Eats two foods by turn 6 (score +2), with (6,3) consumed before it expires (life span 9 at turn 2, so disappears after turn 10).\n- **Risk Avoidance:** \n  - Avoids (1,6) entirely, as it is a death trap.\n  - After eating (3,2), moving up instead of down prevents entrapment near (3,1) and obstacles like (3,4).\n  - The path to (6,3) is obstacle-free: (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3) are all safe cells.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** Beyond turn 6, the snake can safely move up to (6,4) or down to (6,2) to explore, with no immediate threats. The snake is positioned to potentially eat other foods or avoid starvation.\n- **Direction Constraints:** No instant reverses (e.g., from R at turn 2 to U at turn 3 is allowed).\n\n**Food Life Span Tracking (after each turn):**\n- (3,2): Life span 8 at turn 2 → eaten at turn 2 (removed).\n- (3,1): Life span 8 at turn 2 → decreases to 7 after turn 2, 6 after turn 3, etc. (expires after turn 9; not eaten to avoid risk).\n- (1,6): Life span 8 at turn 2 → decreases similarly (expires after turn 9; avoided).\n- (6,3): Life span 9 at turn 2 → decreases to 8 after turn 2, 7 after turn 3, etc. → eaten at turn 6 (life span 4 at turn 6 start).\n\nThis plan ensures the snake grows to length 3 by turn 6 with +2 score, while maintaining flexibility for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R (right)\nTurn 3: U (up)\nTurn 4: R (right)\nTurn 5: R (right)\nTurn 6: R (right)\n}",
