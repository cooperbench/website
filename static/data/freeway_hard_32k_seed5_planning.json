The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I'm not where a car is at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. The car positions are given at turn t1=0, and for future turns, I need to calculate where they are based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway row:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12). Since it's right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T] because t1=0.\n\nt1=0, so for turn T, span is [τ + sT, h + sT] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sT, τ - sT], but here all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? It says (-48,-59,right,6) for both 2 and 3? No, let me read:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1 | (48,37,right,12)\n\n2 | (-48,-59,right,6)\n\n3 | (-48,-59,right,6)  — that can't be right; probably it's a list, but it says \"Cars\" and then multiple entries? No, for freeway 1, it's one car, for 2,3,4,5,6 each has one car with same parameters? But for 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |  \n\n| 1 | (48,37,right,12) |  — one car\n\n| 2 | (-48,-59,right,6) |  — one car\n\n| 3 | (-48,-59,right,6) |  — another one? Or is it the same? It says for each row.\n\nPerhaps it's per freeway, and for freeway 2, it has one car, similarly for 3,4,5,6 each has one car with (-48,-59,right,6)? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nThen:\n\n| 7 | (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6) |  — three cars\n\n| 8 | (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6) |  — three cars\n\nFor freeways 1 to 6, except 1, all have similar cars, but 1 is different.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 2: one car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: one car (-48,-59,right,6) — same as 2? Or different instance?\n\nSimilarly, 4,5,6 each have one car with (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nThen 7 and 8 have three cars each with the same parameters.\n\nNow, for a car, at turn T, the span is given, and collision happens if at turn T, when the player is on that freeway, the position x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always, and y_t is the row.\n\nAt each turn, after moving, y_{t} is the row, and if for that row, at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on that row, collision.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you are not on that new row until the next turn? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThe key point is: at turn T, after action, you are on row y_T for the purpose of collision check. If you move to a different row, you are only on that new row starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen, you choose action a_t: U, D, or S.\n\nThen, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen, after this, for collision check at turn t+1? I think the collision is checked after the move.\n\nThe game dynamics say: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: when you move at turn T to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, at turn T you are still on y_T, so collision check is for row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so check row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, since you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, but the position is updated at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nStandard way: at the start of turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t is chosen, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for collision, at turn t, when you are on row y_t, we check if 0 is in span of any car on row y_t at turn t.\n\nIf not, you survive, and move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, you are on y_{t+1}, check collision on that row at turn t+1.\n\nThe note confirms that when you move at turn T, you are not on the new row until turn T+1 for collision purposes.\n\nSo for row change at turn T, at turn T you are on old row, at turn T+1 on new row.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to find when each freeway has a car at x=0 for different turns.\n\nSince x=0, and cars are moving, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at turn T, it must not be one of those turns where collision happens.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nSo for each freeway y, I need the set of turns T where it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is in some car's span on y at T.\n\nThen, for the path, I need to go from y=0 at turn 0 to y=9 at some turn H, with y_H =9, and for each turn t from 0 to H-1, when at y_t, it is safe, meaning no collision at that turn for row y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, check row y_t at turn t.\n\nAnd at turn H, when y_H=9, we don't need to check collision for the goal, I think, since we just need to reach (0,9), and collision might be checked, but the goal is to be at (0,9), so probably we need to be safe at turn H as well.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"avoid collisions\", so I think at the turn when we are at (0,9), it must be safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for start, at turn 0, position (0,0), but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so always safe to be there.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so only when on rows 1 to 8, we need to worry about cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe at all times.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 0, which is safe, and needs to be at (0,9) at some turn H, which is also safe.\n\nNow, the actions: each turn, I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and min moves would be to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the car rows when it's unsafe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for a car with head h, tail τ, speed s, at turn T, span is [τ + sT, h + sT] for right-moving, since t1=0.\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + sT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sT.\n\nSince the car is moving right, and x=0, we can find for each car, the interval of T where this inequality holds.\n\nThen for a freeway with multiple cars, it is unsafe if any car has 0 in span at that T.\n\nThen, for each row, I can find the set of T where it is safe or unsafe.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably H is small, so I should compute for small T.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12T\n\nSince 37+12T ≤0 and 0≤48+12T.\n\nFirst, 0≤48+12T always true for T≥0, since 48>0.\n\n37+12T ≤0 ⇒ 12T ≤ -37 ⇒ T ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but T≥0, so no solution. Thus, for T≥0, 37+12T ≥37>0, so 0 < 37+12T ≤ x ≤48+12T, so 0 not in span. Thus, freeway 1 is always safe for all T≥0.\n\nIs that right? τ=37, which is positive, and moving right, so at T=0, span [37,48], all positive, x=0 not in. As T increases, it moves further right, so always x>37>0, so indeed, 0 never in span. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6\n\nh and τ, which is head and tail? For right-moving, head is greater, so h should be greater than τ.\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 1, h=48, τ=37, so h>τ, since moving right, head is at higher x.\n\nSimilarly, here h=-48, τ=-59, since -48 > -59, so yes.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nSo, -59 + 6T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ⇒ 6T ≤ 59 ⇒ T ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 6T ⇒ 48 ≤ 6T ⇒ T ≥ 48/6 = 8\n\nSo T from 8 to 9.833, since T integer, T=8,9\n\nFor T=8: span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is equal to upper bound.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: span [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], -5≤0≤6, yes.\n\nT=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same car, (-48,-59,right,6), so same as freeway 2, unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, unsafe T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe T=8,9.\n\nAll from 2 to 6 have identical cars? Freeway 2,3,4,5,6 each have one car with same parameters, so each has unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, so unsafe at T=8,9 for this car.\n\nBut there are other cars.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nh=-12, τ=-23, since -12 > -23.\n\nSpan at T: [-23 + 6T, -12 + 6T]\n\n0 in span: -23+6T ≤ 0 ≤ -12+6T\n\nSo -23+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T≤23 ⇒ T≤23/6≈3.833\n\nAnd 0≤ -12+6T ⇒ 6T≥12 ⇒ T≥2\n\nSo T=2,3\n\nT=2: span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nh=24, τ=13\n\nSpan: [13 + 6T, 24 + 6T]\n\n0 in span: 13+6T ≤0 ≤24+6T\n\n13+6T ≤0? 6T≤-13, impossible since T≥0, 13+6T≥13>0, so lower bound >0, thus 0 never in span. Always safe for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when first car is at issue, i.e., T=8,9 or second car T=2,3.\n\nSince multiple cars, unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nSo unsafe for T=2,3 (from second car), and T=8,9 (from first car).\n\nT=2 and 3 from second car, T=8 and 9 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at T=2,3 and T=8,9.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5,6: each unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always.\n\nThe path: we need to go through rows 1 to 8, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe for that turn.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn t, when we are on row y_t, it must be that row y_t is safe at turn t.\n\nSince we can stay or move, we can wait at safe rows.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, since we start at turn 0, position y=0.\n\nWe can take actions to change y.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal number of up moves: 9, since from 0 to 9, but we can stay or move down, but that would increase H, so for min H, we should avoid unnecessary stays or downs.\n\nH is the number of turns, including turn 0? Let's see.\n\nTurn t1=0 is current turn, we start at turn 0.\n\nAfter H turns, we have taken H actions, from t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, at turn H, we are at position y_H.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nThe turns involved are from turn 0 to turn H.\n\nAt each turn t from 0 to H-1, we are at y_t, and after action, y_{t+1}, and at turn t, we check collision for y_t.\n\nAt turn H, we are at y_H=9, and we need to check collision? But y=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 0, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, for t from 0 to H, but collision check at each t for y_t.\n\nFor t=0 and t=H, y_t is 0 or 9, safe.\n\nFor t from 1 to H-1, if we are on rows 1-8, need safe.\n\nThe actions: at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, min H such that after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nSince we start at y_0=0, after k up moves, y increases by k, so to reach 9, min 9 up moves, with no down or stay, so H=9 actions, from t=0 to t=8, and at turn 9, y_9=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nIn this case, with only up moves, we move to y=1 at turn 1, y=2 at turn 2, ..., up to y=9 at turn 9.\n\nNow, at each turn t, we are on row y_t = t, since we start at 0 and move up each time.\n\ny_0=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=9\n\nSo at turn t, for t=1 to 8, we are on row y=t.\n\nNow, we need row y=t to be safe at turn t.\n\nFor each row, at turn equal to row number.\n\nNow, let's see for each row when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, so at turn 1, row 1 is safe.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=8,9. At turn t=2, row 2, is it unsafe? For row 2, unsafe only at T=8,9, but T is time, not row.\n\nRow 2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe at turn 8 and 9.\n\nBut at turn t=2, for row 2, since row 2 is unsafe only at T=8,9, so at T=2, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: freeway 3, unsafe at T=8,9, so at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4,5,6: each unsafe at T=8,9 only, so at T=4,5,6,7 etc., safe except T=8,9.\n\nNow row 7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=2,3,8,9.\n\nSo at T=7, is it safe? T=7 not in {2,3,8,9}, so yes, safe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=2,3,8,9.\n\nAt T=8, unsafe, but we are on row at turn t.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nAt turn t=1, row=1, safe (freeway 1 always safe)\n\nTurn t=2, row=2, freeway 2 safe at t=2 (since unsafe only at 8,9)\n\nTurn t=3, row=3, safe\n\nt=4, row=4, safe\n\nt=5, row=5, safe\n\nt=6, row=6, safe\n\nt=7, row=7, freeway 7 unsafe at t=2,3,8,9. t=7 not in, so safe.\n\nt=8, row=8, freeway 8 unsafe at t=2,3,8,9. t=8 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt turn 8, we are on row 8, but freeway 8 is unsafe at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9, we are at y=9, safe, but at turn 8, collision.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 8, y_8=8, and we need to be safe, but row 8 is unsafe at turn 8.\n\nAlso, for row 7 at turn 7, it was safe, but row 8 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\nMoreover, at turn 9, y_9=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 8, collision occurs if we are on row 8.\n\nIn the direct up path, at turn 8, we are on row 8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 8 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at turn 2 or 3, but in this path, at turn 2 we are on row 2, not row 7.\n\nIn the direct path, only issue is at turn 8, row 8.\n\nNow, row 8 is also unsafe at turn 9, but at turn 9 we are at y=9, not on row 8.\n\nThe problem is only when on the row at that turn.\n\nSo for min H, H=9 is possible if we can avoid the collision at turn 8.\n\nBut in direct path, we are on row 8 at turn 8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or move slower.\n\nSince row 8 is unsafe at turn 8 and 9, but we need to cross row 8.\n\nAt turn 7, we are on row 7, which is safe at turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, we choose action to go to row 8 at turn 8, but row 8 at turn 8 is unsafe.\n\nWe could stay at row 7 for one turn, then go to row 8 at turn 9, but row 8 at turn 9 is also unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, if we are on row 8, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut we want to be at row 9 at some point.\n\nWe can go to row 8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, go to row 8 at turn when it is safe.\n\nRow 8 is safe except at T=2,3,8,9.\n\nSo safe at T=0,1,4,5,6,7,10,etc.\n\nSimilarly for row 7.\n\nIn the direct path, we reach row 7 at turn 7, which is safe.\n\nThen we need to go to row 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, row 8 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at row 7 at turn 7, then at turn 8, we are still on row 7, and take action.\n\nAt turn 7: position y_7=7 (in the path, but we can change).\n\nAssume we are at row 7 at some turn.\n\nFor example, if we arrive at row 7 at turn t=7, as in direct path.\n\nThen at turn 7, we are on row 7, safe (since t=7 not unsafe for row 7).\n\nThen we choose action for turn 7.\n\nIf we go up, y_8=8, then at turn 8, on row 8, which is unsafe at turn 8.\n\nIf we stay, a_7=S, then y_8=7, so at turn 8, we are on row 7.\n\nNow, row 7 at turn 8: freeway 7 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9. T=8 is unsafe! So at turn 8, on row 7, row 7 is unsafe at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, but that might not help.\n\nSo at turn 8, row 7 is unsafe, row 8 is unsafe.\n\nWhat about row 6? Freeway 6 is row 6, unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nAt turn 8, row 6 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5,4,etc, all rows 1-8 except row 1 might be unsafe at turn 8 or 9.\n\nRow 1 is always safe.\n\nBut we are at row 7.\n\nAt turn 8, all rows from 1 to 8 have issues?\n\nLet's see which rows are safe at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe, so row 1 safe at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=8,9, so row 2 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, row 3,4,5,6: all unsafe at turn 8.\n\nRow 7: unsafe at turn 8.\n\nRow 8: unsafe at turn 8.\n\nOnly row 1 is safe at turn 8, since freeway 1 always safe.\n\nAnd rows 0 and 9 are safe, but we are not there.\n\nAt turn 8, the only safe row is row 1, or row 0 or 9.\n\nBut row 0 and 9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nNow, in our case, at turn 7, we are at row 7.\n\nIf we want to be safe at turn 8, we need to be on a row that is safe at turn 8.\n\nPossible rows: row 1, row 0, row 9.\n\nBut from row 7, we can only go to row 6,7,8 with one move, not to row 1 directly.\n\nSo at turn 7, if we go down, to row 6, but row 6 at turn 8 is unsafe.\n\nIf stay, row 7 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\nIf up, row 8 at turn 8 unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe at turn 8.\n\nBut we can be at a different row at turn 7.\n\nPerhaps we need to reach row 7 earlier or later.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at row 7 at turn 7.\n\nBut row 7 is safe at turn 7, but not at turn 8.\n\nWe need to be at row 7 at a different time.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nTo min H, we might need to delay or advance some moves.\n\nSince row 8 is unsafe at turn 8 and 9, we need to be on row 8 at a different turn, say turn 7 or turn 10, etc.\n\nBut turn 7: if we are on row 8 at turn 7, is it safe?\n\nRow 8 at turn 7: freeway 8 unsafe at T=2,3,8,9, so T=7 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at turn 7 is safe, as before.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 7, we are on row 7, safe.\n\nIf at turn 7, we go up to row 8, we arrive at row 8 at turn 8, which is unsafe.\n\nBut if we can be at row 8 at turn 7.\n\nHow? To be at row 8 at turn 7, we need to have y_7=8.\n\nThat means we must have arrived earlier.\n\nFor example, if we move faster in the beginning.\n\nBut we start at row 0 turn 0.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn 7, y_7 could be up to 7 if we move up each time, or less if we stay or down.\n\nMax y at turn t is min(t,9), since start from 0.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0\n\nTurn 1, y<=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 7, y<=7.\n\nSo at turn 7, y_7 <=7, so we cannot be at row 8 at turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0 if we stay, but max is 7.\n\nSo at turn 7, y_7 <=7, so we can only be on rows 0 to 7.\n\nThus, at turn 7, we cannot be on row 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, y<=6, etc.\n\nSo to be on row 8, the earliest turn is turn 8, with y_8=8 if we go up all the way.\n\nBut at turn 8, row 8 is unsafe.\n\nWe can be on row 8 later, at turn 10 for example, but that would increase H.\n\nSince we want min H, we should try to be on row 8 at a safe time, but the safe times for row 8 are T=0,1,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nBut T=0,1: at turn 0 or 1, we are at low rows, cannot be on row 8.\n\nT=4,5,6,7: at these turns, we can be on row 8 only if we move faster, but as above, at turn 4, y<=4, so cannot be on row 8.\n\nSimilarly, turn 5, y<=5; turn 6, y<=6; turn 7, y<=7; all less than 8.\n\nSo the only possible times to be on row 8 are turn 8 or later.\n\nBut at turn 8 and 9, row 8 is unsafe.\n\nAt turn 10, row 8 is safe, since T=10 not in unsafe set.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nBut if we go to row 8 at turn 10, then to row 9 at turn 11, H=11, which is larger than 9.\n\nBut with H=9, we might have a problem at turn 8.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid row 8 at turn 8 by being on a different row.\n\nBut at turn 8, all rows 2-8 are unsafe except row 1.\n\nRow 1 is safe at all times.\n\nSo at turn 8, we can be on row 1, which is safe.\n\nOr on row 0 or 9.\n\nBut row 0 or 9 may not be where we want.\n\nFor example, if we are at row 1 at turn 8, we can then go up to row 2, etc., but we need to reach row 9.\n\nBut this might take more turns.\n\nSince we need to min H, perhaps H=9 is still possible if we can be on row 1 at turn 8, but we start from row 0.\n\nLet's think of a path where at turn 8, we are on row 1.\n\nBut to be on row 1 at turn 8, we must have moved down or stayed multiple times.\n\nFor example, start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nTurn 1, go to y=1 (up)\n\nThen at turn 1, on row 1, safe.\n\nBut we need to be at row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 1 to turn 8, we can stay on row 1 for 7 turns, but that would be slow.\n\nOr move down to 0, but not efficient.\n\nTo min H, we want to go up fast, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are concentrated around T=8,9 for many rows.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 8, only row 1 is safe among 1-8.\n\nAt turn 9, let's see which rows are safe.\n\nTurn 9:\n\nRow 1: safe\n\nRow 2: unsafe (freeway 2 unsafe at T=8,9)\n\nSimilarly row 3,4,5,6 unsafe at T=9\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=9\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=9\n\nSo at turn 9, only row 1 is safe, or 0/9.\n\nRow 9 is safe, but we are not there yet.\n\nSo at turn 9, only row 1 is safe among 1-8.\n\nTo avoid collision, at turn 8 and turn 9, we should be on row 1, or on 0/9.\n\nBut since we need to reach 9, we can be on row 1 at turn 8 and 9, then go up later.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 9 at turn 9.\n\nBut to be on row 9 at turn 9, we need y_9=9, which requires 9 up moves in 9 turns, so from turn 0 to 8, all up, but at turn 8 we are on row 8, which is unsafe, and we cannot avoid that.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 0.\n\nAnother idea: go up fast to row 7 by turn 7, which is safe, then instead of going to row 8 at turn 8, we go down or stay, but as before, at turn 8, row 7 is unsafe, and row 6 etc all unsafe except row 1.\n\nSo from row 7 at turn 7, we cannot go to a safe row at turn 8 except by going to row 6,7,8 all unsafe, or if we could go to row 1, but not possible.\n\nThe only way to be safe at turn 8 is to be on row 1 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9.\n\nSo we need to be on row 1 at turn 8 and turn 9.\n\nThen after that, go up to row 9.\n\nBut that will take more turns.\n\nFor example, let's compute min H.\n\nSuppose we go directly to row 1 by turn 1: at turn 0, y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nThen at turn 1, on row 1, safe.\n\nNow, we need to be on row 1 at turn 8 and 9.\n\nSo from turn 1 to turn 7, we can stay on row 1 or move, but to be at row 1 at turn 8, we need y8=1.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9, y9=1 if we stay.\n\nBut we can move down to 0 and back, but not necessary.\n\nTo save turns, we can stay on row 1 from turn 1 to turn 9, but at turn 9, we are on row 1, then we need to go to row 9, which takes 8 more up moves, so from turn 9 to turn 17, we go up to row 9 at turn 17, H=17, large.\n\nBut we can leave row 1 earlier.\n\nWe need to be on row 1 at turn 8 and turn 9 specifically.\n\nAt turn 8, we are on row 1.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on row 1.\n\nThen after turn 9, we can go up.\n\nBut turn 9 is when we are on row 1.\n\nNow, from turn 1 to turn 8, we can be on other rows as long as we return to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nBut to min H, we should go up as much as possible before turn 8, then come down to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 8 and 9, we stay on row 1.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nFirst, let's find when the unsafe times are.\n\nThe critical turns are 8 and 9 where many rows are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, for rows 2-6, unsafe only at 8 and 9.\n\nRow 7 and 8 unsafe at 2,3,8,9, but 2 and 3 are early, we can avoid.\n\nRow 1 always safe.\n\nSo for min H, we can go up quickly to row 7 by some turn before 8, say turn 7, which is safe, then at turn 7, instead of going up, we go down to lower rows to reach row 1 at turn 8.\n\nBut from row 7 at turn 7, we can go down to row 6 at turn 8, but row 6 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nGo down to row 5, same, all unsafe except row 1.\n\nBut from row 7, in one move, we can only reach row 6,7,8.\n\nAll unsafe at turn 8.\n\nSo impossible to reach a safe row at turn 8 from row 7 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must be at a row lower than 7 at turn 7, so that at turn 8 we can be on row 1.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, if we are on row 1, then at turn 8, we can be on row 1 by staying.\n\nThen at turn 9, stay on row 1.\n\nThen from there, go up to row 9.\n\nBut to be on row 1 at turn 7, we need to have arrived earlier.\n\nLet's plan the path to be at row 1 at turn 7, turn 8, and turn 9, then go up.\n\nBut at turn 7,8,9 on row 1.\n\nThen from turn 1 to turn 6, we can be going up or down.\n\nBut to min H, we should go up as much as possible before turn 7.\n\nFor example, from turn 0 to turn 6, we can go up to row 6.\n\nAt turn 0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nTurn 1: on row 1, safe. a1=U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: on row 2, safe (row 2 safe at t=2), a2=U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: on row 3, safe, a3=U, y4=4\n\nTurn 4: on row 4, safe, a4=U, y5=5\n\nTurn 5: on row 5, safe, a5=U, y6=6\n\nTurn 6: on row 6, row 6 safe at t=6 (since unsafe only t=8,9), so safe. a6=U, y7=7\n\nTurn 7: on row 7, safe (t=7 not unsafe for row 7), now instead of going up, we go down to row 6? But at turn 8, row 6 unsafe.\n\nWe need to be at row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom row 7 at turn 7, we can go down multiple times, but each down move takes a turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, a7=D, then y8=6\n\nBut at turn 8, on row 6, which is unsafe.\n\nThen collision.\n\nIf a7=D, y8=6, but unsafe.\n\nOr a7=S, y8=7, unsafe.\n\na7=U, y8=8, unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nBut at turn 7, we are on row 7, but we need to be lower at turn 7 to reach row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFor example, if at turn 7 we are on row 2, then we can go down to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nBut to be on row 2 at turn 7, we must have moved down earlier.\n\nFor instance, after reaching high row, come down before turn 7.\n\nBut that wastes turns.\n\nLet's think of the position at each turn.\n\nSuppose we want to be on row 1 at turn 8.\n\nWe need to reach row 1 by turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 9.\n\nAlso, at turn 7, we can be on a row that allows us to go to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom row r at turn 7, with one action, we can go to r-1, r, or r+1.\n\nTo reach row 1 at turn 8, we need to be at row 0,1, or 2 at turn 7.\n\nBecause from row 0: go U to row 1\n\nRow 1: go S to row 1 or D to 0 but we want 1, so S or U? U to 2, not 1. To stay on row 1, a=S or a=D to 0 or U to 2, so to be on row 1 at turn 8, from row 1 at turn 7, a=S, y8=1; or from row 0 at turn 7, a=U, y8=1; or from row 2 at turn 7, a=D, y8=1.\n\nSo at turn 7, we need to be on row 0,1, or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 8 to turn 9, to be on row 1 at turn 9, similarly, at turn 8 we need to be on row 0,1,2.\n\nBut at turn 8, we are on row 1, so for turn 9, we can stay or move, but to be on row 1 at turn 9, from row 1 at turn 8, a=S, y9=1; or from row 0, a=U; or row 2, a=D.\n\nSince we are at row 1 at turn 8, we can just stay at turn 8 to be at row 1 at turn 9.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nWe need to reach row 9 as soon as possible after turn 9.\n\nFirst, we must spend turns 8 and 9 on row 1 to avoid collision.\n\nSo at turn 8 and turn 9, we are on row 1.\n\nThen from turn 10 onwards, we can go up to row 9.\n\nFrom row 1 to row 9, need 8 up moves, so at turn 10, y10=2 if we go up at turn 9? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 8: on row 1\n\nAction a8: to go to row 1 or other, but we want to be on row 1 at turn 9, so a8=S, then y9=1\n\nThen at turn 9, on row 1, safe.\n\nThen action a9: U, to go up, y10=2\n\nThen a10:U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nUp to a16:U, y17=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y17=9, H=17 turns from t=0 to t=16 actions? Let's count.\n\nTurn t=0: start y0=0\n\nActions from t=0 to t=16, 17 actions, y at turn 17.\n\nNumber of actions H=17, turns from 0 to 16.\n\nBut this is large, and we can do better by not staying on row 1 for long.\n\nWe don't need to be on row 1 at turn 7, only at turn 8 and 9.\n\nFrom turn 0 to turn 7, we can be going up.\n\nFor example, go up to row 7 by turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, y7=7\n\nThen from there, we need to be at row 0,1,2 at turn 7 to reach row 1 at turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 7, y7=7, which is row 7, not 0,1,2.\n\nSo we cannot reach row 1 at turn 8 from row 7 at turn 7 in one move.\n\nWe need to be lower at turn 7.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, we can be at high row, but at turn 6, if we are at row 6, then at turn 6, we can go down to row 5 at turn 7, but row 5 at turn 7 is safe, but we need to be at row 0,1,2 at turn 7.\n\nSo from row 6 at turn 6, after action, y7 could be 5,6,7.\n\nNone of which is 0,1,2.\n\nTo be at row 2 at turn 7, for example, we need to be at row 1,2,3 at turn 6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo to be at a low row at turn 7, we need to have moved down earlier, which wastes the up moves.\n\nFor instance, to be at row 2 at turn 7, we could have gone up to row 7 by turn 6 or something.\n\nMax at turn 6 is y6=6.\n\nThen to be at row 2 at turn 7, from row 6 at turn 6, we can go down four times, but each down move takes a turn, so from turn 6 to turn 7, we can only move one step down to row 5, not to row 2.\n\nSo it takes multiple turns to go down.\n\nFor example, to go from row 6 to row 2, it takes at least 4 down moves, 4 turns.\n\nSo if at turn 6 we are at row 6, we can go down to row 5 at turn 7, row 4 at turn 8, but at turn 8 we want to be on row 1, not row 4.\n\nAnd row 4 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe need to be at a lower row earlier.\n\nPerhaps go up slowly or stay at some rows.\n\nBut to min H, we should go up as fast as possible except around the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times for specific rows.\n\nFor example, row 7 is unsafe at T=2,3,8,9\n\nRow 8 at T=2,3,8,9\n\nRows 2-6 at T=8,9 only.\n\nRow 1 always safe.\n\nSo for T=2 and 3, row 7 and 8 are unsafe, but at T=2 and 3, in the direct path, we are on row 2 and 3, which are safe, so no problem.\n\nOnly T=8 and 9 are critical for all rows 2-8 except row 1.\n\nSo to avoid, we must not be on rows 2-8 at turn 8 and 9.\n\nThat means at turn 8 and 9, we must be on row 0,1, or 9.\n\nBut row 9 is the goal, so if we can be on row 9 at turn 8 or 9, good, but to be on row 9 at turn 8, we need y8=9, which requires 8 up moves in 8 turns, from turn 0 to 7, all up, y8=8, not 9. Max at turn 8 is 8, so cannot be on row 9 before turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, y8<=8, so we can be on row 0,1, or 2-8, but 2-8 unsafe, so only row 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly at turn 9, y9<=9, can be on row 0,1, or 9, or 2-8 but unsafe, so only 0,1,9.\n\nBut row 9 is safe.\n\nSo to min H, we can be on row 9 at turn 9.\n\nBut to be on row 9 at turn 9, we need y9=9, which requires 9 up moves in 9 turns, so from turn 0 to 8, all U, but at turn 8, we are on row 8, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 9 at turn 9 with H=9 because of the collision at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, to be on row 9 at turn 10, H=10.\n\nWith H=10, we can be at row 9 at turn 10.\n\nFor example, go up to row 8 at turn 8, but row 8 unsafe at turn 8, so we cannot be on row 8 at turn 8.\n\nGo to row 8 at turn 10, but turn 10 is late.\n\nLet's try H=10.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions.\n\nWe need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 8 and 9, we must be on row 0,1, or 9.\n\nBut at turn 8, y8<=8, so row 0 or 1.\n\nAt turn 9, y9<=9, so row 0,1, or 9.\n\nIf we can be on row 1 at turn 8 and turn 9, then at turn 9 go to row 9? From row 1 to row 9 in one move? No, impossible.\n\nFrom row 1, it takes multiple moves to go up.\n\nSo at turn 9, if we are on row 1, we can go up to row 2 at turn 10, etc.\n\nBut we want y10=9, so at turn 10, position.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to have made 9 up moves by turn 9.\n\nLet k be the number of up moves, then y_t <= t, and to have y_t =9, t>=9.\n\nWith H actions, at turn H, y_H=9, so H >=9.\n\nMin H=9 if possible, but we saw not because of turn 8.\n\nWith H=10, at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nAt turn 8, we must be on row 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly at turn 9, on row 0,1, or9.\n\nIf at turn 9 we are on row 9, good, but to be on row 9 at turn 9, we need y9=9, which requires 9 up moves by turn 8, so y8=8 or 9, but y8=8 if we go up at turn 8, or y8=9 if we were at 9 and stay, but at turn 8, y8<=8, so y8=8 if we go up from 7 at turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, on row 8 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be on row 9 at turn 9 with H=10 because to be on row 9 at turn 9, we must have been on row 8 at turn 8 with up move, but row 8 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nIf we are on row 9 at turn 8, impossible.\n\nSo the only way to be on row 9 at turn 9 is to be on row 8 at turn 8 and go up, but row 8 unsafe at turn 8, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on row 9 at turn 9 without being on row 8 at turn 8 or earlier, but at turn 8 it is unsafe if on row 8.\n\nBut we can be on row 9 at turn 10.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, we are on row 8, but row 8 unsafe at turn 9, so we cannot be on row 8 at turn 9.\n\nTo be on row 9 at turn 10, we need to be on row 8 at turn 9 and go up, but at turn 9, on row 8 unsafe.\n\nOr on row 9 at turn 9 and stay, but as above, cannot be on row 9 at turn 9.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on row 9 is turn 10, and to do that, we must be on row 8 at turn 9 and go up, but row 8 unsafe at turn 9, so we cannot be on row 8 at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on row 7 at turn 9 and go up to row 8 at turn 10, then to row 9 at turn 11, etc.\n\nBut let's find when we can be on row 8 safely.\n\nRow 8 safe at T=4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n\nAt T=4, we can be on row 8? At turn 4, y4<=4, so no.\n\nSimilarly T=5, y<=5; T=6, y<=6; T=7, y<=7; all less than 8.\n\nT=10, y10 can be 8 if we have 8 up moves by turn 9, but at turn 10, we can be on row 8.\n\nAt turn T=10, if we are on row 8, it is safe, since T=10 not unsafe.\n\nThen from there, go to row 9 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, we need to be on a safe row.\n\nAt turn 9, safe rows are row 1, row 0, row 9.\n\nBut row 9 not reachable yet.\n\nSo at turn 9, we can be on row 1 or 0.\n\nSimilarly at turn 8, on row 0 or 1.\n\nSo to have min H, we can be on row 1 at turn 8 and 9, then go to row 8 at turn 10, safe, then to row 9 at turn 11.\n\nH=11.\n\nFrom row 1 to row 8, need 7 up moves, from turn 9 to turn 15, y at turn 16=9, H=16.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nTurn 8: on row 1\n\na8: S, so y9=1 (to stay on row 1 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: on row 1, a9: U, y10=2\n\nTurn 10: on row 2, row 2 safe at t=10 (since unsafe only t=8,9), so safe. a10: U, y11=3\n\nTurn 11: row 3 safe, a11: U, y12=4\n\nTurn 12: row 4 safe, a12: U, y13=5\n\nTurn 13: row 5 safe, a13: U, y14=6\n\nTurn 14: row 6 safe, a14: U, y15=7\n\nTurn 15: on row 7, row 7 safe at t=15 (unsafe t=2,3,8,9, t=15 safe), a15: U, y16=8\n\nTurn 16: on row 8, row 8 safe at t=16 (unsafe t=2,3,8,9, t=16 safe), a16: U, y17=9\n\nTurn 17: y17=9, safe.\n\nH=17 actions from t=0 to t=16.\n\nBut we have to get to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nHow to get to row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom start, we can go up to some point then down.\n\nFor example, go up to row 7 by turn 7 as before.\n\nTurn 0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nTurn 1: a1=U, y2=2\n\n...\nUp to turn 6: a6=U, y7=7\n\nTurn 7: on row 7, safe, but we need to be at row 1 at turn 8.\n\nFrom row 7, we can go down, but it takes turns.\n\nAt turn 7, a7=D, y8=6, but row 6 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt turn 7, we are at row 7, but we need to be at row 1, so we must start going down earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 6, we are at row 6.\n\nThen at turn 6, a6=D, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: on row 5, safe? Row 5 safe at t=7 (unsafe only t=8,9), so safe. a7=D, y8=4\n\nBut at turn 8, on row 4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down further.\n\nTo reach row 1 at turn 8, from row 6 at turn 6, we need to go down 5 times, but from turn 6 to turn 8, only two actions, so y8 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\ny6=6, then a6 and a7.\n\nWith two down moves, y8=6-2=4, or with one down one stay, y8=5, etc, can only reach down to row 4 at turn 8, not row 1.\n\nSo impossible to reach row 1 at turn 8 from high row at turn 6.\n\nWe need to be at a lower row at turn 6.\n\nFor example, to be at row 2 at turn 6.\n\nThen from there, at turn 6, a6=D, y7=1\n\nThen at turn 7, on row 1, safe. a7=S, y8=1\n\nThen at turn 8, on row 1, safe.\n\nSimilarly for turn 9, a8=S, y9=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up as before.\n\nBut to be at row 2 at turn 6, we need to have not gone up all the way.\n\nFor example, from turn 0 to turn 5, go up to row 5 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5, a5=D, y6=4? Let's see.\n\nTurn 0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nTurn 1: a1=U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nTurn 4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nTurn 5: on row 5, safe at t=5. a5=D, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: on row 4, safe at t=6. a6=D, y7=3\n\nTurn 7: on row 3, row 3 safe at t=7 (unsafe only t=8,9), so safe. a7=D, y8=2\n\nBut at turn 8, on row 2, but row 2 unsafe at turn 8! Row 2 freeway 2 unsafe at T=8, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom turn 7 row 3, a7=D, y8=2, unsafe.\n\na7=S, y8=3, row 3 unsafe at t=8.\n\na7=U, y8=4, row 4 unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe at turn 8.\n\nSo to be safe at turn 8, we need to be on row 1.\n\nFrom row 3 at turn 7, we can go down to row 2 at turn 8, but row 2 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the only way is to be on row 1 at turn 7 or lower.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, on row 1.\n\nThen a7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to be on row 1 at turn 7, we need to have moved down earlier or stayed.\n\nFor example, go to row 1 quickly and stay.\n\nTurn 0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nThen from turn 1 to turn 7, all a_t=S, so y_t=1 for t=1 to 7.\n\nAt turn 7, y7=1, safe.\n\na7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen from turn 9, a9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\n...\na16=U, y17=9\n\nH=17.\n\nTo save some turns, we can go up to row 7 by turn 7, but as before, we can't get down to row 1 in time.\n\nPerhaps go up to row 6 by turn 6, then at turn 6 go down to row 5 at turn 7, but row 5 at turn 7 safe, but then at turn 7, we are at row 5, need to go to row 1, but can't in one move.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to avoid the delay; we must spend turns 8 and 9 on row 1, so min H is 17.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a faster way.\n\nAnother idea: since row 1 is always safe, we can be on row 1 at turns 8 and 9, but for other turns, we can be higher.\n\nFor example, from turn 0 to turn 7, we can be on rows up to 7.\n\nBut at turn 7, we must be on row 1 to reach row 1 at turn 8.\n\nTo be on row 1 at turn 7, we must have y7=1.\n\nSo from start, we can go to row 1 at turn 1, then stay until turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, on row 1, a7=S, y8=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nthen go up.\n\nBut at turn 1 to 7, we are on row 1, which is safe, but we could have been higher, but if we go higher, we have to come down, which takes extra turns, so it's worse or same.\n\nFor example, go to row 7 at turn 7, but then to get to row 1 at turn 8, impossible, so we must be low at turn 7.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is achieved by staying on row 1 from turn 1 to turn 9, then going up to row 9 by turn 17.\n\nH=17.\n\nBut let's see if we can leave earlier.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on row 1, but we can go up from there, but to reach row 9, it takes 8 more turns, turn 17.\n\nIf we are on row 1 at turn 8 and 9, but at turn 7 we can be higher, but to be on row 1 at turn 8, at turn 7 we must be on row 0,1,2.\n\nIf at turn 7 we are on row 2, for example.\n\nHow to be on row 2 at turn 7.\n\nFrom start, go up to row 2 at turn 2.\n\nThen stay or move.\n\nBut to be at row 2 at turn 7, we can stay from turn 2 to turn 7 on row 2.\n\nBut at turn 2, row 2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at turn 7, on row 2, a7=D, y8=1\n\nThen at turn 8, on row 1, safe.\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\netc, to y17=9.\n\nSame as before, H=17.\n\nIf at turn 7 we are on row 2, and we go down to row 1 at turn 8, then we start going up from turn 9.\n\nBut from turn 9 row 1 to turn 17 row 9, same.\n\nNo savings.\n\nGo to row 7 by turn 7, but then at turn 7 we are at row 7, can only go to row 6,7,8 at turn 8, all unsafe, so we must not be on row 7 at turn 7 if we want to be safe at turn 8.\n\nSo we must be at row 1 or lower at turn 7.\n\nTherefore, for min H, we can go to row 1 quickly and stay there until after turn 9.\n\nThen H=17.\n\nBut let's check the car on row 7 and 8 at early turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, row 7 is unsafe, but in the path, we are not on row 7 at turn 2, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly for turn 3.\n\nSo only turns 8 and 9 are the issue.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 9 at turn 10.\n\nTo be on row 9 at turn 10, we need to be on row 8 at turn 9 and go up, but row 8 unsafe at turn 9.\n\nOr on row 9 at turn 9 and stay, but can't be on row 9 at turn 9.\n\nSo we must be on row 8 at a safe turn, like turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, on row 8, safe, then a10=U, y11=9.\n\nBut to be on row 8 at turn 10, we need to have made 8 up moves by turn 9.\n\ny at turn 10 is after action at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, position y9, after action a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9.\n\nTo have y10=8, for example.\n\nThen at turn 10, on row 8.\n\nBut at turn 9, we are on y9, which must be safe.\n\ny9 could be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nBut at turn 9, on row 7, row 7 unsafe at turn 9, so collision.\n\nIf y9=8, a9=S, y10=8, but at turn 9 on row 8 unsafe.\n\nIf y9=9, a9=S, y10=9, but can't be on row 9 at turn 9.\n\nSo all cases, at turn 9, if we are on row 7 or 8, it is unsafe, and row 9 not possible.\n\nIf we are on row 1 at turn 9, safe, but then y10=2 if a9=U, not 8.\n\nSo to be on row 8 at turn 10, we must have y10=8, which requires that at turn 9, we are on row 7,8, or9 and choose action to go to 8.\n\nBut on row 7,8,9 at turn 9: row 7 and 8 unsafe, row 9 not possible.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 8 at turn 10 because it requires being on an unsafe row or impossible row at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, to be on row 8 at turn 11, for example.\n\nAt turn 11, on row 8, safe.\n\nThen y11=8, a11=U, y12=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nTo have y11=8, we need to be on row 7,8,9 at turn 10 and action to go to 8.\n\nAt turn 10, on row 7,8, or9.\n\nRow 7 at turn 10: safe, since unsafe only t=2,3,8,9.\n\nRow 8 at turn 10: safe, similarly.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nSo possible.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, on row 7, a10=U, y11=8\n\nThen at turn 11, on row 8, safe, a11=U, y12=9.\n\nOr at turn 10 on row 8, a10=S, y11=8, etc.\n\nBut to be on row 7 at turn 10, for example.\n\nNow, we need to get to row 7 by turn 10 safely, and avoid turn 8 and 9 on unsafe rows.\n\nSo for turn 8 and 9, be on row 1.\n\nFor example, at turn 8: on row 1\n\nTurn 9: on row 1\n\nThen from turn 9 to turn 10, a9=U, y10=2\n\nThen to reach row 7 at turn 10, we are at row 2 at turn 10, not 7.\n\nTo be on row 7 at turn 10, we need to have y10=7.\n\nFrom row 1 at turn 9, a9=U, y10=2, so at turn 10 on row 2.\n\nThen it takes more turns to go to row 7.\n\nFor example, from turn 10 row 2 to turn 16 row 8, then to row 9 at turn 17, same as before.\n\nTo be higher at turn 10, we need to be higher at turn 9, but at turn 9, we are on row 1, so y9=1.\n\nSo y10 <=2.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 at turn 10 if we are on row 1 at turn 9.\n\nThe only way to be high at later turns is to not spend turns 8 and 9 on row 1, but we have to, to avoid collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 17 with the path: go to row 1 at turn 1, stay until turn 9, then go up each turn to row 9 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 1, we go to row 1, then stay for 7 turns until turn 7, then at turn 8 and 9 still on row 1, then from turn 9 to turn 16 go up to row 9 at turn 17.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: a0=U, to y1=1\n\nTurn 1: a1=S, y2=1\n\nTurn 2: a2=S, y3=1\n\n...\nTurn 7: a7=S, y8=1\n\nTurn 8: a8=S, y9=1\n\nTurn 9: a9=U, y10=2\n\nTurn 10: a10=U, y11=3\n\nTurn 11: a11=U, y12=4\n\nTurn 12: a12=U, y13=5\n\nTurn 13: a13=U, y14=6\n\nTurn 14: a14=U, y15=7\n\nTurn 15: a15=U, y16=8\n\nTurn 16: a16=U, y17=9\n\nAt each turn, when on row 1 from turn 1 to turn 9, it is safe because row 1 always safe.\n\nFrom turn 10 to 16, on rows 2 to 8, but at turns 10 to 16, which are not 8 or 9, so all safe, as per earlier.\n\nFor example, row 2 unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt turn 15, on row 7 at t=15, safe; turn 16 on row 8 at t=16, safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, row 9 safe.\n\nH=17 turns from t=0 to t=16 actions.\n\nNumber of actions H=17.\n\nBut perhaps we can start going up later.\n\nSince row 1 is safe, and we need to be there at turn 8 and 9, we can go up to row 7 by turn 7, but then at turn 7, we must go down, but we can't reach row 1 in time, so it's not better.\n\nTherefore, min H is 17.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have cars that are unsafe at T=2,3, but at those times, in the path, we are not on those rows, so ok.\n\nIn this path, we are on row 1 at turn 2 and 3, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 9 at turn 11.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, on row 8, but to be on row 8 at turn 10, we need y10=8.\n\nFrom start, if we go up directly, at turn 8, y8=8, but unsafe, so we can't.\n\nIf we delay, but to have y10=8, we can have 8 up moves by turn 10, with some stays or downs, but with downs, it takes more up moves, so y10 could be less.\n\nMax y10=10, but we need to avoid turn 8 and 9.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, we can be on row 7, safe.\n\nThen at turn 7, if we stay, a7=S, y8=7, but row 7 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nIf we go down, y8=6, row 6 unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we must be on row 0 or 1 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, I think 17 is the best.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on row 9 at turn 10.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need 9 up moves in 10 turns, so one stay or down.\n\nBut at some point, we must be on unsafe rows at safe times.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a down move or stay at turn 8 or 9 to avoid being on unsafe row.\n\nAt turn 8, if we are on row 1, safe, we can do a down move to row 0, but row 0 safe, but not helpful.\n\nOr stay.\n\nBut to reach row 9 at turn 10, from turn 8 row 1, we go up at turn 8 to row 2 at turn 9, then at turn 9 on row 2, but row 2 unsafe at turn 9! Collision.\n\nIf at turn 8 on row 1, a8=U, y9=2, at turn 9 on row 2, unsafe.\n\na8=D, y9=0, safe, then a9=U, y10=1, not 9.\n\nSo cannot reach high quickly.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 17.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for this specific setup, since freeway 1 is always safe, and rows 2-6 are safe except at t=8,9, we can go up to row 6 by turn 6, then at turn 6, instead of going up, we go down to row 5 at turn 7, safe, then at turn 7, go down to row 4 at turn 8, but row 4 unsafe at turn 8.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo to row 1 at turn 6, but how?\n\nI think it's not possible to do better than 17.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nStart at t=0, y=0\n\nAction a0=U, to y1=1\n\nThen for t=1 to 8, action S, so y_t=1 for t=1 to 8? t from 1 to 8 actions.\n\nTurn t=1: action a1, to y2\n\nAt turn 1, position y1=1, action a1, determines y2.\n\nIf a1=S, y2=1\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be on row 1 from turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 1 to turn 9, position y_t=1 for t=1 to 9.\n\nAt turn 9, y9=1.\n\nThen action a9=U, to y10=2\n\netc.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nTurn 0: a0=U  // to y1=1\n\nTurn 1: a1=S  // y2=1\n\nTurn 2: a2=S  // y3=1\n\nTurn 3: a3=S  // y4=1\n\nTurn 4: a4=S  // y5=1\n\nTurn 5: a5=S  // y6=1\n\nTurn 6: a6=S  // y7=1\n\nTurn 7: a7=S  // y8=1\n\nTurn 8: a8=S  // y9=1\n\nTurn 9: a9=U  // y10=2\n\nTurn 10: a10=U // y11=3\n\nTurn 11: a11=U // y12=4\n\nTurn 12: a12=U // y13=5\n\nTurn 13: a13=U // y14=6\n\nTurn 14: a14=U // y15=7\n\nTurn 15: a15=U // y16=8\n\nTurn 16: a16=U // y17=9\n\nAt turn 17, y17=9.\n\nH=17 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns to reach, so from turn 0 to turn 17, with 17 actions.\n\nThe sequence has 17 actions from t=0 to t=16.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed from turn t1=0 to turn t1+H-1, but t1=0, so turns 0 to H-1 for actions, position at H.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at those turns.\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nHere t1=0, so actions at turn 0 to turn H-1, position at turn H.\n\nSo for position at turn H=17, actions from turn 0 to 16.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 0 to turn 16.\n\nIn the box, list for each turn the action.\n\nBut in the path above, from turn 1 to turn 8, we have stay actions, but at turn 1 to turn 8, we are on row 1, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but since we need to be at row 1 at turn 8 and 9, and it takes time to go down, it's not better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 7 and 8 at t=2 and 3.\n\nIn this path, at t=2 and 3, we are on row 1, safe, no issue.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, the player must account for the unsafe times on each freeway. The unsafe times, derived from the car positions and movements, are as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1: Always safe.\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, and 9.\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, and 9.\n\nRows y=0 and y=9 have no cars and are always safe. The critical unsafe turns are 8 and 9, where all freeways from 2 to 8 are unsafe except for freeway 1 (y=1), which is always safe. To avoid collision, the player must be on row y=1 at turns 8 and 9, as it is the only safe row among y=1 to 8 during these turns.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to reach (0, 9) is 17. The sequence involves:\n- Moving up to row 1 at turn 1.\n- Staying on row 1 from turn 1 to turn 9 to avoid collisions during turns 8 and 9.\n- Moving up from row 1 to row 9 from turn 10 to turn 16, reaching row 9 at turn 17.\n\nThis path ensures that at each turn, the player is on a safe row:\n- Turns 1 to 9: On row 1 (always safe).\n- Turn 10: On row 2 (safe at turn 10, as unsafe only at turns 8 and 9).\n- Turn 11: On row 3 (safe at turn 11).\n- Turn 12: On row 4 (safe at turn 12).\n- Turn 13: On row 5 (safe at turn 13).\n- Turn 14: On row 6 (safe at turn 14).\n- Turn 15: On row 7 (safe at turn 15, as unsafe only at turns 2, 3, 8, 9).\n- Turn 16: On row 8 (safe at turn 16, as unsafe only at turns 2, 3, 8, 9).\n- Turn 17: On row 9 (safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 0 to 16 (H=17 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: S \\\\\nTurn 2: S \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I start at turn t1=1, position y=1. The goal is to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars are on freeways 1 through 8, and for each, I have their positions at turn t1=1.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=12)\n\nSince direction is right, it's moving right, so at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] because for right-moving, it says: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all these seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nAll cars listed have direction right, so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12)\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [49 + 12(T-1), 60 + 12(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: (-42, -53, right, 6)\n\nh=-42, τ=-53? Head and tail: for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ should be left end, h right end? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning τ is the left (smaller) end, h is the right (larger) end? But in the example, for freeway 1, h=60, τ=49, so τ=49 < h=60, so [49,60] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-42, -53, right, 6). If τ and h, but -53 < -42, so τ=-53, h=-42? The car state is given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for direction, it might be consistent.\n\nIn freeway 1, it's (60,49,right,12), and since right, span is [49,60] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-42,-53,right,6). -53 < -42, so τ=-53, h=-42, so span at t1 is [-53,-42]? But that would be from -53 to -42, which is left to right, but since moving right, it should be fine.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: all same as freeway 2? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 3: (-42,-53,right,6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\n(30,19,right,6): 19<30, so τ=19, h=30? But span [19,30] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (-6,-17,right,6): -17<-6, so τ=-17, h=-6, span [-17,-6]\n\nAnd (-42,-53,right,6): τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. From the note:\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nLet me parse this.\n\nAt turn T, you are on freeway y_T.\n\nYou choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, so collision check: for freeway y_T, if 0 is in span of any car on y_T at time T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so collision check for y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, meaning action at T changes y, so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T.\n\nThen, at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at time T don't affect you, even if 0 is in their span at T, because you're not there.\n\nAnd at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check if 0 in span at T+1 for y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay on the same freeway, you are on that freeway at both turns.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=1.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, but the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so when you are on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut at turn T, if y_T=0 or 9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, the player can move up, down, or stay, but since we start at y=1 and want to go to y=9, we probably want to go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8 at the times we are there.\n\nNow, since we start at y=1 at turn 1, we need to check if there is a collision at turn 1 on y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 has cars: only one car with span at t=1: [49,60] for y=1? Freeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nThe freeway is given as k, which is the y-coordinate.\n\nSo for freeway 1, y=1, at turn t=1, span [49,60], since right-moving, s=12.\n\nNow, 0 is at x=0, so is 0 in [49,60]? 49 to 60, 0 is not between, so no collision at turn 1 on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we are on y=1 at turn 1, so only y=1 matters for now.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=1 to y=9 with only U actions would be 8 moves: from y=1 to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in 8 turns, so at turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when we are on y=k at turn t, no car on y=k has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nSince we start at turn 1, y=1.\n\nAfter action at turn 1, y_{2} = y1 + Δy, etc.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars on that freeway at time t.\n\nWe start at turn 1, y1=1.\n\nWe need to reach y_H =9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=1 to t=H-1, since at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}, so to have y_H=9, we need actions from t=1 to t=H-1, and after H-1 actions, we are at y_H.\n\nFor example, start turn 1, y1=1.\n\nAfter action a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n\nAt turn 2, y2, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H =9.\n\nAnd for each turn t from 1 to H-1, we need no collision at that turn on y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, so collision check for y_t at time t.\n\nWhen y_H=9, we don't care about collision at turn H if we are on y_H=9, since no cars, but we need to reach it, so at turn H, if y_H=9, it's safe.\n\nBut the collision is only checked when we are on freeways 1-8.\n\nNow, for y=9, no issue.\n\nSimilarly y=0.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nI need to find when the cars on each freeway have 0 in their span.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time t, the span for each car.\n\nSince t starts from t1=1.\n\nSet τ = t - t1 = t - 1, so time offset.\n\nAt time t, which is turn number, the car positions are based on t.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with given (h, τ, d, s) at t=1.\n\nSince all d=right, I'll use that.\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s(t-1), h + s(t-1)] for right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t=1? Let's clarify notation.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving, where at t1, span is [τ, h].\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), and for dir right, at t1, span is [tail, head]? In freeway 1, (60,49,right,12), and span at t1 is [49,60], so head=60 (right end), tail=49 (left end).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for any car, at time t, span is [left(t), right(t)] where:\n\nFor right-moving: left(t) = τ + s(t - t1) = τ + s(t-1)\n\nright(t) = h + s(t-1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if left(t) ≤ 0 ≤ right(t)\n\nSince the span is inclusive, I assume.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which t, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at that turn, collision occurs.\n\nSo, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car, τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\nleft(t) = 49 + 12(t-1)\n\nright(t) = 60 + 12(t-1)\n\n0 in span if 49 + 12(t-1) ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 12(t-1)\n\nSince left(t) = 49 + 12(t-1) > 0 for t≥1, because at t=1, 49>0, and increasing, so left(t) >0 for all t, so 0 < left(t) ≤ right(t), so 0 not in [left(t), right(t)] for any t. So freeway 1 is always safe at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): one car: head=-42, tail=-53, s=6, right-moving.\n\nAt t1=1, span [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nleft(t) = τ + s(t-1) = -53 + 6(t-1)\n\nright(t) = h + s(t-1) = -42 + 6(t-1)\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6(t-1) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6(t-1)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst, -53 + 6(t-1) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(t-1) ≤ 53 ⇒ t-1 ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so t ≤ 9.833, so t ≤ 9 since t integer\n\n-53 + 6(t-1) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(t-1) ≤ 53 ⇒ t-1 ≤ 53/6 = 8 + 5/6, so t-1 ≤ 8.833, t ≤ 9.833, so t ≤ 9\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -42 + 6(t-1) ⇒ 42 ≤ 6(t-1) ⇒ t-1 ≥ 42/6 = 7, so t ≥ 8\n\nSo 0 in span when t ≥ 8 and t ≤ 9, so t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8: left(8) = -53 + 6(7) = -53 + 42 = -11\n\nright(8) = -42 + 42 = 0? -42 + 6*(8-1) = -42 + 6*7 = -42 + 42 =0\n\nSo span at t=8: [left(8), right(8)] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9: left(9) = -53 + 6*8 = -53 + 48 = -5\n\nright(9) = -42 + 48 = 6\n\nSo [ -5, 6], 0 in it.\n\nFor t=8: [-11,0], 0≤0, so yes.\n\nAt t=10: left= -53 +6*9= -53+54=1, right= -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=7: left= -53+6*6= -53+36= -17, right= -42+36= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, occupied at x=0 only at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2, because car is (-42,-53,right,6), identical.\n\nSo also occupied at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): same, occupied t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, occupied t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, occupied t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): multiple cars.\n\nCars: \n\n1. (-42,-53,right,6) same as above, so can be occupied at t=8,9\n\nBut there are other cars.\n\nCar 1: same as freeway 2 car, so at t=8 and t=9, 0 in span for this car.\n\nCar 2: (-6,-17,right,6) head=-6, tail=-17? At t1, span [τ,h] = [-17,-6] since τ=-17, h=-6.\n\nleft(t) = τ + s(t-1) = -17 + 6(t-1)\n\nright(t) = h + s(t-1) = -6 + 6(t-1)\n\n0 in span if -17 + 6(t-1) ≤ 0 ≤ -6 + 6(t-1)\n\nFirst: -17 + 6(t-1) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(t-1) ≤ 17 ⇒ t-1 ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, t ≤ 3.833, so t≤3\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6 + 6(t-1) ⇒ 6 ≤ 6(t-1) ⇒ 1 ≤ t-1 ⇒ t ≥ 2\n\nSo t≥2 and t≤3, so t=2 and t=3.\n\nAt t=2: left(2) = -17 + 6(1) = -17+6= -11\n\nright(2) = -6 +6=0\n\nspan [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=3: left= -17+12= -5? t-1=2, 6*2=12, left= -17+12= -5, right= -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=4: left= -17+18=1, right= -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=1: left= -17 +0 = -17, right= -6+0= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, occupied at t=2 and t=3.\n\nCar 3: (30,19,right,6) head=30, tail=19? At t1, span [19,30]\n\nleft(t) = 19 + 6(t-1)\n\nright(t) = 30 + 6(t-1)\n\n0 in span? left(t) =19 +6(t-1) ≥19>0 for t≥1, so always greater than 0, 0 not in span. So this car never at x=0.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, cars are present: car1 can have 0 at t=8,9; car2 at t=2,3; car3 never.\n\nSo overall for y=7, occupied at x=0 when: from car2 at t=2,3; from car1 at t=8,9. So times t=2,3,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): same cars as freeway 7: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nSo same as above: occupied at t=2,3 (from car2), and t=8,9 (from car1), and car3 never.\n\nSo y=8 occupied at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway y, the times t when it is occupied at x=0 (collision possible if player there).\n\ny=1: never occupied, always safe.\n\ny=2: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=3: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=4: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=5: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=6: occupied t=8,9\n\ny=7: occupied t=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: occupied t=2,3,8,9\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 1, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: if we go directly up, we can reach in 8 moves: from y=1 at t=1, after 8 U actions, at t=9 y=9.\n\nNow, check the path:\n\nAt each turn t, y_t:\n\nt=1: y=1, safe (always)\n\nAction a1: U, so y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, is it occupied? y=2 occupied at t=8,9, but t=2 not 8 or 9, so safe? t=2, y=2 occupied only at t=8,9, so at t=2, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen action a2: U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, occupied at t=8,9, not t=3, so safe.\n\na3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, occupied t=8,9, not t=4, safe.\n\na4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, occupied t=8,9, not t=5, safe.\n\na5: U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, occupied t=8,9, not t=6, safe.\n\na6: U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y=7, occupied at t=2,3,8,9. t=7 not in {2,3,8,9}, so safe.\n\na7: U, y8=8\n\nt=8: y=8, occupied at t=2,3,8,9. t=8 is occupied! Oh, collision.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, and freeway 8 occupied at t=8.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThen a8: U, y9=9, but at t=8 collision, so dead.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nt=8 y=8 is bad.\n\nSimilarly, if we delay, but we want minimal turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=7, y=7, which is safe since t=7 not occupied time.\n\nBut at t=8, if we go to y=8, collision.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 at t=7 is safe, we could stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nAction at t=7: instead of U, we do S, so y8=7 (same as y7)\n\nThen at t=8: y=7, now is y=7 occupied at t=8? Yes, t=8 is occupied for y=7.\n\ny=7 occupied at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nSo at t=8, on y=7, collision.\n\nIf we go down to y=6 at t=8, but y6 at t=8: y=6 occupied at t=8, yes.\n\ny=6 occupied at t=8,9.\n\nSo also collision.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, if we do U to y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nS to y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nD to y=6 at t=8, y=6 at t=8 occupied, collision.\n\nAll actions from t=7 lead to collision at t=8 if we are at y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7: we are on y=7 at t=7, which is safe.\n\nThen action a7: determines y8.\n\nIf a7=U, y8=8, then at t=8, we are on y=8, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=7, at t=8 on y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf a7=D, y8=6, at t=8 on y=6, occupied, collision.\n\nSo indeed, from t=7 y=7, no matter what we do, at t=8 we will be on one of y=6,7,8, all of which are occupied at t=8, so collision inevitable at t=8 if we are on a freeway at t=7? Not necessarily.\n\nWe could be on a safe freeway at t=7.\n\nBut in this case, at t=7, if we are on y=7, it is safe, but the next turn t=8, all y=6,7,8 are occupied, so wherever we go, we hit.\n\ny=5: at t=8, y=5 occupied, yes.\n\ny=4,3,2 all occupied at t=8,9.\n\ny=1 safe, but from y=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6,7,8 all occupied at t=8.\n\nSo if at t=7 we are on y=7, we cannot avoid collision at t=8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on any freeway at turn t=7? No, at t=7, we need to be on a freeway that is not occupied at t=7, but the problem is at t=8.\n\nWe need to not be on a freeway at t=8 when it is occupied.\n\nBut at t=8, all freeways from y=2 to y=8 are occupied except y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe always, but y=1 at t=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe, but we are not there yet.\n\nSo, if at t=8 we are on y=1, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if on y=9, safe.\n\nBut we start from y=1.\n\nTo avoid t=8, we need to be on y=1 at t=8, or on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 might be possible.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIn the direct up path, we reach y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut from there, we cannot go to y=8 at t=8 because collision, and staying or down also collision at t=8.\n\nSo we need to be at a different position at t=7.\n\nPerhaps we need to reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we go slower.\n\nStart at t=1, y=1.\n\nInstead of going up every turn, we might stay or go down to avoid the occupied times.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we don't want to waste time.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupied times for each y:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=2,3,8,9\n\nSafe times:\n\ny=2: safe for t=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... except t=8,9\n\nSimilarly y=3 to 6: safe for t=1 to7, and t=10 onwards, except t=8,9.\n\ny=7: safe for t=1,4,5,6,7,10,... except t=2,3,8,9? t=1,4,5,6,7 are safe, t=2,3,8,9 unsafe.\n\nt=1: y=7 not occupied? At t=1, for y=7, cars: car2 span [-17,-6], 0 not in; car1 [-53,-42], 0 not; car3 [19,30], 0 not. So safe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly t=4: car1 left= -53+6*3= -53+18= -35, right= -42+18= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not; car2 left= -17+6*3= -17+18=1, right= -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not; car3 [19+18,30+18]= [37,48], 0 not. So safe.\n\nt=5: car1 left= -53+24= -29, right= -42+24= -18; car2 left= -17+24=7, right= -6+24=18; car3 [19+24,30+24]= [43,54]; all away from 0.\n\nSimilarly t=6,7 safe as before.\n\ny=8 same as y=7 for safe/unsafe times.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=1 at t=1 to y=9 at some t.\n\nSince between t=8 and t=9, many freeways occupied, we need to be above before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 by t=7, that would be fast.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=1, to y=9 in 6 moves: actions at t=1 to t=6, y7=9? Start y1=1, after a1, y2; ... after a6, y7.\n\ny7=1 + number of U minus number of D.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=1 in 6 moves, need net +8, but each U +1, D -1, S 0, so min moves to go up 8 is 8 moves, cannot in 6 moves. Impossible.\n\nIn 7 moves: net +8 with 7 actions. Possible only if all U and one extra, but 7 actions, net change sum Δy = +8, but each Δy <=1, so min number of U is 8, with 8 actions, but with 7 actions, max y is 1+7=8, cannot reach 9. Similarly, with k actions, max y is 1+k, so to reach y=9, need at least 8 actions, so min H=9, with y9=9 after 8 actions.\n\nWith H-1 actions, y_H = y1 + sum of Δy from t=1 to H-1.\n\ny1=1, y_H=9, so sum Δy from t=1 to H-1 must be +8.\n\nEach Δy = +1, -1, or 0, so number of U minus number of D must be 8.\n\nMinimal H when we have 8 U and no D or S, but S would require more actions.\n\nMinimal H is when we have 8 U and no other actions, so H-1=8 actions, H=9, y9=9.\n\nIf we have S or D, we need more actions, so H larger.\n\nThus minimal possible H is 9.\n\nBut in that case, as before, we have issue at t=8.\n\nIn the sequence: t=1 y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\n...\nup to t=7 y=7, then a7=U, y8=8, but at t=8 y=8 collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, we could be on y=9 at t=8, but y=9 at t=8 is safe, but to be on y=9 at t=8, we need y8=9.\n\ny8=9 means after 7 actions from t=1 to t=7, y8=9.\n\nBut y1=1, after 7 actions, max y=1+7=8, cannot be 9. Impossible.\n\ny8 <= y1 +7 =8, so at t=8, y<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, we must be on some y from 0 to 8.\n\ny=0 to 8.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 safe, y=2 to 8 all occupied at t=8 except y=1? y=1 is safe always.\n\ny=1 not occupied at t=8.\n\ny=1 safe at all t.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut if we are on y=1 at t=8, it is safe.\n\nThen later we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe need to be on a safe freeway at t=8.\n\nSafe at t=8: only y=1, since y=2-8 all occupied.\n\ny=0 also safe, but y=0 might be below.\n\nAt t=8, safe freeways: y=0, y=1, y=9 but not reachable yet.\n\ny=9 not reachable at t=8.\n\nSo only y=0 and y=1 are safe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y=2-8 occupied, so only y=0,1,9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 is goal.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we can go up to y=7 or so before t=8, then at t=8 be on y=1 or y=0, then after t=9, go up.\n\nt=9 is also occupied for y=2-8.\n\nAfter t=9, from t=10, all freeways are safe again except y=7 and y=8 might have issues, but y=7 and y=8 occupied at t=8,9, but after t=9, at t=10, for example y=7: car1 at t=10, left= -53 +6*9= -53+54=1, right= -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in; car2 at t=10, left= -17+54=37? s(t-1) for t=10, t-1=9, s=6, so car2 left= -17 +6*9= -17+54=37, right= -6+54=48; car3 [19+54,30+54]= [73,84], all away. Similarly other cars, so at t=10, all freeways safe.\n\nSimilarly t=11, etc.\n\nSo after t=9, safe to go.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should go as far as possible before t=8, then avoid t=8 and t=9 by being on safe y, then after t=9, go to y=9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, we need to be on y=1 or y=0.\n\ny=0 might be possible, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's plan the path.\n\nStart at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nWe need to reach high y quickly, but not too high that we get stuck.\n\nFor example, we can go up to y=7 by t=7, but at t=7 y=7 is safe, but then at t=8, we cannot stay on freeway, so we must move to y=1 or y=0 at t=8.\n\nBut from y=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8 with actions, all occupied at t=8.\n\nWe cannot reach y=1 from y=7 in one move.\n\nThe actions: from y=7, we can go to y=6,7, or 8.\n\nCannot go to y=1 directly.\n\nSo if at t=7 we are at y=7, we cannot be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 not possible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=7 at t=7; we need to be at a lower y earlier so that by t=8 we can be at y=1.\n\nFor example, be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen from t=1 to t=8, we need to have y8=1.\n\nBut we start at y1=1, so if we stay at y=1 from t=1 to t=8, then at t=8 y=1 safe, but then we are at y=1, and we need to go to y=9, which takes 8 more moves, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nWe can go up to some point, then come down to y=1 by t=8.\n\nBut going down wastes moves.\n\nSince we have time before t=8, we can go up slowly.\n\nList the turns.\n\nWe need to be at y=1 at t=8 to be safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=1.\n\nThen after that, we can go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=8, to y=9, need 8 U actions, so at t=9 y=2, t=10 y=3, ..., t=16 y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=2, which is occupied at t=9, collision! Problem.\n\nAt t=9, y=2 to y=8 all occupied.\n\nSo if at t=9 we are on y=2 to y=8, collision.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=8, if we go U to y=2 at t=9, then at t=9 on y=2, occupied, collision.\n\nIf we stay S, y=1 at t=9, y=1 safe at t=9.\n\nBut then we are stuck at y=1.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at t=9, safe, but then we need to come back up.\n\nBut that takes more time.\n\nTo avoid t=9, we need to be on safe y at t=9, which is y=0,1,9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable from y=1 in one move.\n\nSo at t=9, we can be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf on y=1, safe, but then later we need to go up when safe.\n\nAfter t=9, from t=10, all freeways safe, so we can go up freely.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=1, it takes 8 moves, so from t=10 to t=17, y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut H=17, which is larger than 9, not minimal.\n\nWe can be on y=0 at t=9 or something.\n\nBut let's think if we can reach higher before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=7, but as before, we cannot escape t=8.\n\nUnless we are not on a freeway at t=8, but we have to be somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: at t=8, if we are on y=9, but impossible as y8<=8.\n\ny=0 is possible.\n\nIf at t=8 we are on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we can be on y=0 or y=1 or go up to y=1.\n\nBut at t=9, if on y=1, safe, or y=0 safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to be on y=0 at t=8, we need to go down from some point.\n\nFor example, start from y=1 at t=1.\n\nGo up to y=7 by t=7, but at t=7 y=7, then to go to y=0 at t=8, impossible, because from y=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8, not to y=0 directly.\n\nThe player can only move to adjacent y or stay, so y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=7, we can only reach y=6,7,8 next turn.\n\nCannot reach y=0 or y=1 directly.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=0 or y=1 at t=8, we must be at y=0,1, or 2 at t=7.\n\nBecause from y=2 at t=7, we can go down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=7, we can go down to y=0 or stay at y=1 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=7, we can go to y=0 or y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut y=0 at t=7: is it possible? y=0 is safe, but we start from y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, we need to be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nThen from there, we can be at y=0 or 1 at t=8.\n\nNow, at t=7, y=2: is it safe? y=2 occupied at t=8,9, but at t=7, y=2 is safe, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo, for example, we can be at y=2 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, action D, so y8=1.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can stay or move.\n\nBut at t=9, we need to be safe, so on y=0,1, or9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable, so on y=0 or1.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=8, if we go U to y=2 at t=9, but y=2 occupied at t=9, collision.\n\nIf we stay S, y=1 at t=9, safe.\n\nIf we go D to y=0 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up after t=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9, it takes time.\n\nSince at t=9, we can be on y=0 or y=1, and after t=9, from t=10, all freeways safe, we can go up quickly.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nFirst, we need to be at y=2 at t=7, for example.\n\nStart from y=1 at t=1.\n\nGo up to y=2 at t=2: a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2, safe since t=2 not 8 or9.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3 y=3, safe\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4 y=4, safe\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5 y=5, safe\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6 y=6, safe\n\na6=U, y7=7? But y=7 at t=6? Let's see.\n\nAfter a5 at t=5, y6=6\n\nt=6 y=6, then a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7 y=7, which is safe at t=7.\n\nBut we want to be at y=2 at t=7? No, we are at y=7.\n\nTo be at lower y at t=7.\n\nFor example, go slower or down.\n\nBut we want to be high to minimize later moves.\n\nSince we need to be at y=2 at t=7, for example.\n\nFrom start, y1=1\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=7, that means we need to have net +1 in 6 actions (from t=1 to t=6 actions, y7=y6 after a6).\n\ny at turn t after action a_{t-1}, but let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn 1, y1=1\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\nAt turn 2, y2\n\n...\n\nAt turn 7, y7\n\nTo have y7=2\n\nThen at t=7, we choose action, say a7=D, so y8=1\n\nThen at t=8, y8=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can choose a8.\n\nNow, y7=2.\n\ny1=1 to y7=2, net +1 in 6 steps (actions from t=1 to t=6).\n\nNumber of U minus number of D =1, with 6 actions.\n\nFor example, we can have 1 U and 5 S, or 2 U and 1 D and 3 S, etc., but to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible before, but we need to reach y=2 at t=7, not higher.\n\nSince we have to waste time anyway, we can go to higher y earlier, but then come down to y=2 at t=7.\n\nBut coming down takes moves, so it might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, go directly to y=2 quickly, then stay there until t=7.\n\nBut y=2 is safe except t=8,9, so at t=2 to t=7, safe.\n\nSo from t=1 y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nThen at t=2 y=2, we can stay for several turns.\n\nThen at t=7, y7=2, then a7=D, y8=1\n\nt=8 y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we need to choose action for t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we need to be on safe y, y=0 or1.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=2, but at t=9 y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=1, safe.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=0, safe.\n\nThen from t=9, we are on y=1 or y=0.\n\nThen after t=9, from t=10, we can go up to y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at t=9, we need 8 U actions to reach y=9 at t=17.\n\ny at t=9, say y9=1\n\nThen after a9, y10=2\n\nt=10 y=2, safe\n\na9=U, y10=2? y9=1, a9=U, y10=2\n\nThen t=10 y=2, safe\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\n...\nup to a16=U, y17=9\n\nSo at t=17, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we start from y=0 at t=9, similar, but y=0 to y=9 takes 9 moves, longer.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at t=9.\n\nIn this case, H=17, with y17=9.\n\nBut earlier we thought min H=9, but not possible due to occupation.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher before t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=7, but then we cannot go to safe y at t=8.\n\nUnless we are at y=1 at t=7, then at t=8 we can be at y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut at t=7, if at y=1, we can go to y=0 or y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen similar as above.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at high y at t=6 or something.\n\nAnother idea: avoid being on y=7 and y=8 at their unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=7 unsafe at t=2,3,8,9.\n\nt=2 and 3 are early, t=8,9 late.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nSince we start at t=1, we can go to y=7 after t=3, for example.\n\nBut at t=1,2,3, y=7 is unsafe at t=2,3, so we cannot be on y=7 at t=2 or t=3.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=7 at t=4,5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, for the lower freeways, they are only unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nSo, we can go up to y=7 by t=4, for example.\n\nt=1 y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2, safe, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3 y=3, safe, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4 y=4, safe, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5 y=5, safe, a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6 y=6, safe, a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7 y=7, safe (t=7 safe for y=7)\n\nThen at t=7, we are at y=7, safe.\n\nBut now, at t=8, we need to go to safe y, but from here, we can only go to y=6,7,8, all occupied at t=8.\n\nSame problem.\n\nIf at t=7, we are at lower y, say y=6.\n\nt=7 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, if we go to y=6,7,8 all occupied, collision.\n\nOnly if we are at y=1 or lower at t=7.\n\nBut from start, to be at y=1 at t=7, we need to not go up much.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 for several turns.\n\nBut then we lose time.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go as high as possible before the danger zone t=8,9.\n\nThe highest we can be at t=7 is y=7, but we cannot escape from there for t=8.\n\nWe can be at y=1 at t=7, then at t=8 be at y=1, safe, then at t=9 be at y=1, safe, then after t=9 go up.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=9, to y=9 at t=17, H=17.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at t=9 if we go up after t=9, but at t=9 we are at y=1, so we start from there.\n\nAnother thought: at t=9, if we are on y=8, it is occupied, but if we can be on y=9 at t=9, safe.\n\nTo be on y=9 at t=9, we need y9=9.\n\ny1=1, so after 8 actions, y9=9, so 8 U actions from t=1 to t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y8=8 or something, but let's see the sequence.\n\nWith 8 U actions: a1 to a8 all U.\n\ny1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2, safe\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3 y=3, safe\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4 y=4, safe\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5 y=5, safe\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6 y=6, safe\n\na6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7 y=7, safe\n\na7=U, y8=8\n\nt=8 y=8, occupied, collision\n\na8=U, y9=9, but collision at t=8.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf we have one S or D somewhere, we reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, if we have 7 U and 1 S, then y9 =1 +7 -0 =8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 8 actions, we need 8 U, no S or D.\n\nBut collision at t=8.\n\nSo impossible to reach by t=9 with no collision.\n\nMinimal H must be greater than 9.\n\nPerhaps H=10.\n\nWith 9 actions, we can have 8 U and 1 S, for example, so y10=1+8=9.\n\nOr 9 U, but y1=1, 9 U would be y10=10, but y max 9, so y10=9 if we have 8 U and one action that doesn't increase, but with 9 actions, net +8, so 8 U and 1 S, or 9 U and 1 D, etc., but since y<=9, we can have 8 U and 1 S, y10=9.\n\nOr 7 U and 2 S, etc., but with more actions.\n\nMinimal actions to net +8 with y<=9.\n\nWith k actions, net +8, so number of U minus number D =8, number S = k - number U - number D.\n\nBut since U - D =8, and U + D + S = k, so 2U + S = k +8 - D, etc., but min k when no S and no D, k=8.\n\nBut not possible, so min k with S or D.\n\nWith 8 U and 0 D, k=8, y9=9.\n\nWith 8 U and 1 S, k=9 actions, y10=9.\n\nWith 7 U, 1 D, and S, net +6, not enough, need more U.\n\nTo net +8 with min actions, best is 8 U and some S, but S increases actions without progress.\n\nSo min actions to net +8 is 8, with all U.\n\nIf not possible, then 9 actions with 8 U and 1 S, or 9 U but y capped, so 8 U and 1 S, y10=9.\n\nSimilarly, with 7 U and 1 D, net +6, then need more, worse.\n\nSo min H=10 with 9 actions.\n\nNow, with 9 actions, we can have a sequence with 8 U and 1 S, reaching y10=9.\n\nThe S can be placed somewhere to avoid collision.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if we are not on a freeway, or on safe one.\n\nBut at t=8, only y=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, we do S or U, but if U, to y=2 at t=9, occupied.\n\nSo better to do S at t=8 on y=1.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut let's construct the sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to be at y=1 at t=8.\n\ny1=1\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=8, we can stay at y=1 from t=1 to t=8, but then we have wasted moves, and we need to go up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=1: y1=1, safe\n\na1=S, y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, safe\n\na2=S, y3=1\n\n...\n\nup to a7=S, y8=1\n\nt=8: y8=1, safe\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S, y9=1 (or U, but if U, y9=2, occupied at t=9)\n\nSo a8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9: y9=1, safe\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\nt=10: y10=2, safe (since after t=9)\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nH=17, with many S actions.\n\nBut we can go up faster at the beginning.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 by t=7, then at t=7, instead of U, do D to y=6 or something, but at t=8 y=6 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo to y=7 at t=7, then at t=7 do S, y8=7, but at t=8 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nOr do D, y8=6, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we must be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=8, but we can be at higher y before and come down.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at t=4, then come down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut coming down takes moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y4=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y5=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y6=6, a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y7=7, safe, now we need to be at y=1 at t=8, impossible in one move.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, we can do D, y8=6, but y=6 occupied at t=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo multiple down moves earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=4, we are at y=4, instead of going up, we go down or stay.\n\nBut that seems wasteful.\n\nSince we have to be at y=1 at t=8, we can go up to say y=4 or 5 by t=4 or 5, then come down to y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut let's calculate the net.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=8, y1=1 to y8=1, so net change 0, so sum of Δy from t=1 to t=7 actions must be 0.\n\nActions a1 to a7 determine y8.\n\ny8 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 7} Δy_t =1 + sum Δy =1, so sum Δy =0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D =0, and S can be anything.\n\nTo minimize time, we should have as many S as possible at the beginning or end, but since we want to be high earlier, have S later or something.\n\nBut we need to avoid the collision at t=8.\n\nFor the path to y=9, we can have the S at t=8 or something.\n\nLet's list the sequence for H=10.\n\ny10=9 with 9 actions: 8 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S can be at some turn.\n\nWe need that at each turn t from 1 to 9, y_t is safe.\n\ny_t for t=1 to 9.\n\ny1=1 always safe.\n\ny2 to y9 need to be safe at their times.\n\nFor example, if we go up continuously but with one S.\n\nSuppose we have 7 U and 1 S in the first 8 actions, but we need 8 U, so with 9 actions, 8 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S action means we stay at the same y for that turn.\n\nFor example, at some turn, we do S instead of U.\n\nThen we reach y=9 later.\n\nNow, the critical points are t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, we need to be on safe y: y=0 or1.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y=0,1,9.\n\nSince y9=9 only at the end, at t=9, if we are on y=9, it is safe, but to be on y=9 at t=9, we need y9=9, which requires that after 8 actions, y9=9, so with 8 U, but then at t=8 y8=8, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=9 at t=9 with no collision.\n\nTherefore, at t=9, we must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, on y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen after t=9, we go up.\n\nBut at t=9, if on y=1, we can go U to y=2 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut to have y10=9, we need from t=9 y=1 to t=10 y=9, impossible, so H must be later.\n\nLet's accept that and find a sequence with minimal H.\n\nSince we must be on y=0 or 1 at t=8 and t=9, we can stay on y=1 for those turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nBe at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen from t=1 to t=8, we need to have y8=1, so from t=1 to t=7, actions sum Δy=0, so we can have various U and D to stay around.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can go up to y=7 at t=7, but then we need to come down to y=1 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo the highest we can be at t=7 is y=1, if we stay low.\n\nBut let's give up and use the first plan with H=17.\n\nBut that seems long, and we might do better.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, be at y=1.\n\nThen at t=7, a7=S, y8=1\n\nt=8 y=1, safe\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9 y=1, safe\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\nt=10 y=2, safe\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nH=17.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=1 to t=6, go up to y=7.\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y7=7, safe\n\nNow at t=7, we need to go down to y=1 for t=8, but can't in one move.\n\nSo from t=7 y=7, we can do D, y8=6\n\nBut at t=8, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=6, instead of going U to y=7, we can go D to y=5 or something.\n\nBut let's calculate to be at y=1 at t=8.\n\ny8=1.\n\ny1=1, so for actions a1 to a7, sum Δy =0.\n\nSo we can have, for example, 3 U and 3 D and 1 S, or other combinations.\n\nTo be high at some point, we can go up and down.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y4=4, a4=D, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6: y6=2, a6=D, y7=1\n\nt=7: y7=1, a7=S, y8=1 (or a7=D to y=0, but let's keep y=1)\n\nt=8: y8=1, safe\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9: y9=1, safe\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\netc to y17=9 as before.\n\nBut we were at y=4 at t=4, then down to y=1, so we wasted moves going up and down.\n\nBetter to stay at y=1 from the beginning for some turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 from t=1 to t=7 with S actions, then at t=8 and t=9 also S on y=1, then go up.\n\nBut with S actions, we can have fewer actions if we go up directly after.\n\nBut in terms of turns, it's the same.\n\nMinimal H is 17 with this approach.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 faster by being on y=9 at t=10 or something.\n\nWith 9 actions, 8 U and 1 S, y10=9.\n\nNow, where to place the S.\n\nThe S action means at some turn t, we do S, so y_{t+1} = y_t, and at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nWe need to choose t such that at that turn, y_t is safe, and by doing S, we avoid a collision at another turn.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=7 on y=7, but at t=7 y=7 is safe, but then at t=8, if we go U to y=8, collision, or S to y=7, collision at t=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo S at t=8, but at t=8 we need to be on safe y to do S.\n\nBut at t=8, only y=1 safe.\n\nSo if we are on y=1 at t=8, we can do S.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for the sequence with 8 U and 1 S, we must be on y=1 at some point to do the S when it is safe, but at t=8 we can do S on y=1.\n\nBut let's try to have a sequence where we are at y=1 at t=8.\n\nFor example:\n\nGo up to y=7 by t=7 with 6 U actions.\n\ny1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\na6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7 y=7, safe\n\nNow, to be at y=1 at t=8, impossible.\n\nFrom y=7, we can only go to y=6,7,8.\n\nNone safe at t=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at high y at t=7 if we want to be at y=1 at t=8.\n\nThe only way is to be at low y at t=7.\n\nFor example, at t=7, be at y=1.\n\nThen from start, to be at y=1 at t=7, we need sum of actions from t=1 to t=6 to have net 0 change.\n\nFor example, 3 U and 3 D in 6 actions, but y1=1 to y7=1, so actions a1 to a6 determine y7.\n\ny7 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 6} Δy_t =1 + sum Δy =1, so sum Δy =0.\n\nSo for example, 3 U, 3 D, 0 S; or 2 U, 2 D, 2 S, etc.\n\nBut with S, it takes more actions for the same net, so for fixed t, to have net 0, we can have fewer actions with U and D.\n\nBut here we have fixed number of turns.\n\nTo have y7=1, with min actions, but we have to spend 6 turns to have net 0, whereas if we stay, we can have y7=1 with 6 S actions, but we can have U and D to be higher in between, but for reaching y=9 later, it doesn't help.\n\nSo for minimal H, it's better to stay low and then go up after t=9.\n\nH=17 is the best so far.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on y=0 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=0 or y=1.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, it takes 9 moves.\n\nBut similar.\n\nPerhaps at t=9, we can be on y=9 if we can reach it without being on occupied freeways.\n\nBut as before, impossible for t=9.\n\nI think H=17 is the minimal with this strategy.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car on freeway 7 at t=2 and 3.\n\nIn the beginning, at t=2 and t=3, y=7 is occupied, but since we start at y=1, we are not on y=7 at t=2 or 3, so no problem.\n\nThe only issue is t=8 and 9.\n\nSo I think we have to wait them out on y=1 or y=0.\n\nSo minimal H is 17.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by being on y=8 at t=7, then at t=7 go U to y=9 at t=8, but y8=9, impossible from y=7.\n\ny8 <=8.\n\nOr at t=8, if we are on y=8, collision, but if we go to y=9, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that when you move to a new freeway, you are not on it at the current turn.\n\nBut in this case, at the turn when you move, you are on the old freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn t, you are on y_t, choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, collision check for y_t at time t.\n\nAt turn t+1, for y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different y, you are not on the new y at turn t, so no collision from cars on new y at time t.\n\nBut in this case, for the destination freeway at time t, it doesn't affect you.\n\nBut here, the problem is at time t for the current freeway.\n\nI think it doesn't help for t=8 and 9.\n\nSo I think we have to go with H=17.\n\nBut let's list the sequence for the first few turns to be at high y.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y4=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y5=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y6=6, a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y7=7, safe, but now we need to go down for t=8.\n\nBut can't in one move.\n\nSo at t=7, we must do an action that puts us on safe y at t=8, but no.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, we can be at y=6.\n\nt=7 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, if we do U, y8=7, at t=8 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nD, y8=5, y=5 occupied at t=8, collision.\n\nS, y8=6, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\ny=5 at t=7: similarly, at t=8, y=4,5,6 all occupied.\n\nOnly y=1 and y=0 safe at t=8.\n\nSo at t=7, we must be at y=1 or y=0 or y=2 to go to y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=7, be at y=2.\n\nThen a7=D, y8=1\n\nt=8 y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9 y=1, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\netc.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=7.\n\nFrom start, y1=1\n\nTo y7=2, net +1 in 6 actions.\n\nFor example, 4 U, 3 D, and some S, but net U-D=1.\n\nWith 6 actions, U-D=1, and U+D+S=6.\n\nFor example, 4 U, 3 D, S= -1 impossible, so min U+D=6, U-D=1, so 2U=7, U=3.5, not integer.\n\nU-D=1, U+D+S=6.\n\nSet D=k, U=k+1, then S=6 - U - D =6 - (k+1) -k =5-2k\n\nS>=0, so 5-2k >=0, k<=2.\n\nIf k=2, U=3, D=2, S=1\n\nIf k=1, U=2, D=1, S=3\n\nIf k=0, U=1, D=0, S=5\n\n etc.\n\nSo for example, with U=3, D=2, S=1.\n\nWe can have a sequence like:\n\nt=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, a3=D, y4=2\n\nt=4: y4=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=D, y6=2\n\nt=6: y6=2, a6=S, y7=2  (S action)\n\nt=7: y7=2, safe, then a7=D, y8=1\n\nt=8: y8=1, safe\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9: y9=1, safe\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nH=17.\n\nWith the S at t=6, we are at y=2 at t=6 and t=7.\n\nBut still H=17.\n\nIf we go higher earlier, but we have to come down, so net the same.\n\nSo I think H=17 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need the actions from turn t1=1 to turn t1+H-1, but H is the number of turns to reach, so actions from t=1 to t=H-1.\n\nIn this case, for H=17, actions from t=1 to t=16.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from t=1 to t=16 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the first part.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by using y=0.\n\nFor example, at some point go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but moving to it might not help.\n\nI think 17 is best.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U  (y2=2)\n\nTurn 2: U  (y3=3)\n\nTurn 3: D  (y4=2)  // for example, to have net low\n\nBut in the above sequence I have.\n\nTo make it simpler, we can stay at y=1 for the first 9 turns, then go up.\n\nBut that would be H larger.\n\nWith stay:\n\nt=1: S, y2=1\n\nt=2: S, y3=1\n\n...\n\nup to t=8: S, y9=1? Let's see.\n\nAt t=1: y1=1, a1=S, y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, a2=S, y3=1\n\n...\n\nt=7: y7=1, a7=S, y8=1\n\nt=8: y8=1, a8=S, y9=1\n\nt=9: y9=1, a9=U, y10=2\n\netc to a16=U, y17=9\n\nSame as before, but with more S at beginning.\n\nIn the first way, we have some U and D, but same H.\n\nSo for minimal H, it's 17.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose we have 8 U and 1 S.\n\nFor example, do 7 U to reach y=8 at t=8, but at t=8 y=8 collision.\n\nDo S at t=7 on y=7.\n\nt=1: U, y2=2\n\nt=2: U, y3=3\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: U, y6=6\n\nt=6: U, y7=7\n\nt=7: S, y8=7  (S action)\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nDo the S earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=1: S, y2=1\n\nThen t=2: U, y3=2\n\nt=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: U, y6=5\n\nt=6: U, y7=6\n\nt=7: U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nOr at t=6: S on y=6, then t=7: U, y8=7, collision.\n\nAlways when we are on y=7 or 8 at t=8, collision.\n\nThe only way to avoid is to be on y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut with 8 U and 1 S, if we are on y=1 at t=8, that means we have net +0 from t=1 to t=7, so we have U and D canceling, but with 7 actions, net 0, then at t=8 we do U or S, but to be on y=1 at t=8, y8=1, so from t=1 to t=7, net 0, so y8=1.\n\nThen at t=8, we do the S action, so y9=1, then we need to go to y=9, but with one more action, y10=2, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need more actions.\n\nSo impossible with H=10.\n\nSimilarly for any H<17, we cannot avoid the occupation at t=8 and t=9 without being on safe y, which delays the ascent.\n\nSo minimal H is 17.\n\nNow for the sequence, we can choose a simple one.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 from t=1 to t=9, then go up to y=9 from t=10 to t=16.\n\nBut at t=9, we are on y=1.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: S  // but action at turn t determines y_{t+1}, and we are at y=1, so S keeps it.\n\nSince we start at y=1, action a1: if S, y2=1; if U, y2=2, etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t1=1: action a1\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\nTurn t1+1=2: action a2, etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn 1 to turn H, we have positions.\n\nAt turn H, y_H=9.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn H-1.\n\nFor H=17, actions from turn 1 to 16.\n\nSequence:\n\nTo make it simple, we can do:\n\nTurn 1: S  // y2=1\n\nTurn 2: S  // y3=1\n\nTurn 3: S  // y4=1\n\nTurn 4: S  // y5=1\n\nTurn 5: S  // y6=1\n\nTurn 6: S  // y7=1\n\nTurn 7: S  // y8=1\n\nTurn 8: S  // y9=1\n\nTurn 9: U  // y10=2\n\nTurn 10: U  // y11=3\n\nTurn 11: U  // y12=4\n\nTurn 12: U  // y13=5\n\nTurn 13: U  // y14=6\n\nTurn 14: U  // y15=7\n\nTurn 15: U  // y16=8\n\nTurn 16: U  // y17=9\n\nAt each turn, no collision.\n\nFor example, at t=1 to t=8, y=1, safe.\n\nt=9, y=1, safe.\n\nt=10, y=2, safe since t=10>9.\n\nSimilarly all safe.\n\nAnd H=17.\n\nTo have fewer S, we can go up to y=7 and back, but it doesn't reduce H.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, we can go up to y=7 quickly and stay there until t=7, but then we have to come down, which takes turns, so H same or worse.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 by t=7, then from t=7 to t=8, we need to go to y=1, but can't, so not possible.\n\nSo the above sequence is simple.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn 1, and we need to reach (0,9) at turn 17.\n\nActions from turn 1 to 16.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 1 to Turn 16 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut at turn 9, action U, to y10=2, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it shorter, but not possible.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on freeway 7 at t=2 and 3.\n\nIn this sequence, we are never on y=7 at t=2 or 3, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo H=17.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal number of turns H, and the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at turn 10 with 9 actions including one S, but as before, not possible without collision.\n\nSo I think 17 is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 17, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe cars on freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) occupy the position \\(x = 0\\) at specific turns:\n- Freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are occupied at turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is occupied at turns \\(t = 2, 3, 8, 9\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is occupied at turns \\(t = 2, 3, 8, 9\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is always safe, as no car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must avoid being on freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during the occupied turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\). The only safe positions at these turns are \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 1\\), or \\(y = 9\\). However, reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 9 is impossible without colliding at turn 8 or 9, as it requires 8 up actions from turn 1, which would place the player on an occupied freeway at turn 8 or 9.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to:\n- Stay at \\(y = 1\\) (safe) from turn 1 to turn 9 to avoid all occupied freeways during turns 8 and 9.\n- After turn 9, all freeways are safe, so move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) with 8 up actions.\n\nThis results in:\n- \\(y_t = 1\\) for \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is never occupied).\n- Actions from turn 9 to turn 16 are all \"U\" to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 1 to turn 16 is:\n- Turns 1 to 8: \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\(y = 1\\).\n- Turn 9: \"U\" to move to \\(y = 2\\).\n- Turns 10 to 16: \"U\" to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turns 1 to 8: Player is on \\(y = 1\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 9: Player is on \\(y = 1\\), which is safe.\n- At turns 10 to 16: Player moves through freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\), all safe after turn 9.\n\nThus, \\(H = 17\\) is the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check for collisions based on where you are at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=2, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nList the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Head and tail: head h = -48, tail τ = -59? The notation is (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, it says [τ, h] at t_1, so τ should be left end, h right end? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, it's given as [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12). So head h = -48, tail τ = -59. But for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [ -59, -48 ]? That would mean left end -59, right end -48, which makes sense since it's moving right, so at t_1, the car is from x= -59 to x= -48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if it were, [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 2: one car, (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5,6 all the same: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-36, -47, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-36, -47, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving with positive speeds.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, needs to go to y=9. Since y=0 is allowed, but goal is y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut at y=9, that's the goal, so when player reaches (0,9), it's done.\n\nNow, collision only if at some turn T, player is on y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince player moves in y, and cars are on fixed freeways, but moving in x-direction.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since position is (0, y_t), so always x=0.\n\nSo collision if at turn T, player y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for freeway k, there is a car such that 0 is in [left, right] of its span at turn T.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, we need to find when x=0 is covered by that car at turn T.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find the times when they cover x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for T >= t_1.\n\nSet t_1 = 2.\n\nSo for a car, at T, left end: τ + s(T-2)\n\nRight end: h + s(T-2)\n\n0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo condition: τ + s(T-2) <= 0 <= h + s(T-2)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- τ + s(T-2) <= 0  => s(T-2) <= -τ\n\n- and 0 <= h + s(T-2) => s(T-2) >= -h\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for T.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 2, so time since turn 2.\n\nThen for a car, 0 in span when:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0  => s Δt <= -τ  => Δt <= -τ / s  (since s>0)\n\nand 0 <= h + s Δt => s Δt >= -h => Δt >= -h / s\n\nAlso, since the span must contain 0, and it's a continuous interval, but since positions are discrete? The x-axis might be continuous, but the span is given with integers, so probably we consider real positions.\n\nBut for collision, it's when 0 is in the interval, so we need to find T such that Δt >= -h/s and Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince τ is more negative, -τ/s is larger.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 car: h = -48, τ = -59, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSo Δt >= -h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12 = 4\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-59)/12 = 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 4.9167, so at T when Δt=4,5? Δt is T-2, so T=2 + Δt.\n\nT must be integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt can be fractional, but T is integer turn, so we need to see for integer T.\n\nThe span at time T is fixed for that turn, I think.\n\nSince the position changes continuously, but we evaluate at discrete turns.\n\nFor each integer T, we compute the span and check if 0 is in it.\n\nFor freeway 1 car:\n\nAt T, left = τ + s(T-2) = -59 + 12(T-2)\n\nRight = h + s(T-2) = -48 + 12(T-2)\n\n0 in [left, right] if -59 +12(T-2) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12(T-2) <= 0 => 12(T-2) <= 59 => T-2 <= 59/12 ≈4.9167 => T <= 2 + 4.9167 = 6.9167, so T <=6 since T integer? T-2 <= 4.9167, so T-2 <=4 since integer? Let's compute exactly.\n\n12(T-2) <= 59 => T-2 <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so for integer T-2, T-2 <=4? No.\n\nT-2 is integer, so T-2 <= floor(59/12) = floor(4.9167) =4? But let's see:\n\n12(T-2) <=59, for T-2=4, 12*4=48 <=59, true\n\nT-2=5, 12*5=60 >59, false\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 +12(T-2) => 48 <=12(T-2) => 4 <= T-2, so T-2 >=4\n\nSo for T-2 >=4 and T-2 <=4? From above:\n\nT-2 >=4 and T-2 <=4.916, so for integer T-2, only T-2=4, since T-2=5 would be 60>59.\n\nT-2 >=4 from second inequality, and T-2 <=4 from first? Let's see:\n\nFrom 0 <= -48 +12(T-2) => 12(T-2) >=48 => T-2 >=4\n\nFrom -59 +12(T-2) <=0 => 12(T-2) <=59 => T-2 <= 59/12 =4.916, so T-2 <=4 since T-2 integer? T-2 integer, so T-2 <=4 because 4.916, floor is 4? T-2 must be integer, so T-2 <=4 and T-2 >=4, so T-2=4.\n\nThus only at T-2=4, i.e., T=6.\n\nAt T=6, left = -59 +12(4) = -59 +48 = -11\n\nRight = -48 +48 =0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, T-2=3, left = -59 +12*3 = -59+36= -23, right= -48+36= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=7, T-2=5, left= -59+60=1, right= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=6 for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\nAt T, left = τ + s(T-2) = -47 +6(T-2)\n\nRight = h + s(T-2) = -36 +6(T-2)\n\n0 in if -47 +6(T-2) <=0 <= -36 +6(T-2)\n\nFirst: -47 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/6≈7.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6Δt => 6Δt >=36 => Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt >=6 and Δt <=7.833, so for integer Δt, Δt=6,7\n\nT-2=6 or 7, T=8 or 9\n\nAt Δt=6, T=8, left= -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 included\n\nΔt=7, T=9, left= -47+42= -5, right= -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 included\n\nΔt=5, T=7, left= -47+30= -17, right= -36+30= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔt=8, T=10, left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5,6 all same as freeway 2, since all have (-36,-47,right,6), so each has collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 6) same as above, so collision at T=8 and T=9? But for freeway 7.\n\nWe need for each freeway separately.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=6, right-moving\n\nSpan at T: left = τ + s(T-2) = -11 +6(T-2)\n\nRight = h + s(T-2) = 0 +6(T-2)\n\n0 in if -11 +6(Δt) <=0 <= 6(Δt)\n\nFirst inequality: -11 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/6≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6Δt, always true for Δt>=0\n\nSo Δt <=1.833, so for integer Δt, Δt=0,1? Δt=0: T-2=0, T=2\n\nAt T=2, left= -11 +0 = -11, right=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=1, T=3, left= -11+6= -5, right=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔt=2, T=4, left= -11+12=1, right=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, collision at T=2 and T=3.\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,6) head h=36, tail τ=25? But for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ,h] = [25,36]? τ=25, h=36? But usually tail should be left, but here τ=25, h=36, both positive, so [25,36] at t1.\n\nThen at T, span: left = τ + s(T-2) = 25 +6(T-2)\n\nRight = h + s(T-2) =36 +6(T-2)\n\n0 in if 25 +6(Δt) <=0 <=36 +6(Δt)\n\nBut 25 +6Δt >=25 >0 for all Δt>=0, so left >0, thus 0 not <= left, so 0 never in [left,right] since left >=25>0. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars: first car (-36,-47,right,6) collision at T=8,9\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6) collision at T=2,3\n\nThird car (36,25,right,6) never at x=0.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when collision occurs (i.e., when player should not be on that freeway).\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at T=6\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7: from cars:\n\n- First car: collision at T=8,9\n\n- Second car: collision at T=2,3\n\n- Third car: no collision\n\nSo overall, on freeway 7, collision if any car has collision, so at T=2,3,8,9\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, collision at T=2,3,8,9\n\nT=2 and T=3 for the second car.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t1=2, position y=1.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on freeway k, and T is a collision time for k, then collision.\n\nThe player is at (0,y_t) at turn t.\n\nFor turn T, y_T determines which freeway, and we check if for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is covered by a car.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=1 to y=9, with minimal turns.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, but y from 0 to 9, so at y=0, cannot go down, similarly y=9 cannot go up.\n\nStart at y=1, goal y=9.\n\nThe minimal path without cars would be to go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps: at turn 2: y=1, then U to y=2 at turn 3, U to y=3 at turn 4, ..., up to turn 9: y=8, U to y=9 at turn 10. After action at turn T, position at turn T+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t1=2, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1)\n\nThen player chooses action a_{t1} = a_2, which determines y_{3} = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nThen at turn 3, position (0,y_3), choose a_3, and so on.\n\nThe turn when position is set is after the action.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn T, position is (0, y_T)\n\nThen player chooses a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T when the position is (0,y_T), so based on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, we have y_T, and we check for freeway y_T if collision at T.\n\nFor the player to reach (0,9), that means at some turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-2 or something.\n\nStart at turn t1=2, y_2=1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we want y_{t1 + (H-1)} = y_{2 + H -1} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, from turn t1 to t1 + k -1, we reach position at turn t1 + k.\n\nSet: at turn T, y_T.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nStart: turn 2, y_2=1.\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nAfter a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3, etc.\n\nAfter H-1 actions: actions from a_2 to a_{2 + H -2}, then y_{2 + (H-1)} = y_{1 + H}\n\nTurn indices: after 0 actions, turn 2, y_2\n\nAfter 1 action (a_2), turn 3, y_3\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_2,a_3), turn 4, y_4\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, turn 2 + m, y_{2+m}\n\nWe want y_{2+m} =9 for some m.\n\nThen number of turns H? The minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9? t1=2.\n\ny_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t= t1 to t1 + H -2, for H-1 actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t = t1 to t1 + H -1}? Let's see the answer format.\n\nIt says: sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, the position should be (0,9), but after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1 + H} = y_{2+H}\n\nWe want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, position (0,9).\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn during the path.\n\nNow back to the cars.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of y positions from y_2=1 to y_T=9 for some T, with minimal T-2? Since at turn 2, we start, we want to reach at turn K, y_K=9, with K as small as possible.\n\nThen H = K - t1 +1? Let's define the number of turns including start or not.\n\nMinimal K such that y_K=9, with K >=2.\n\nThen the number of actions is K-2, from turn 2 to turn K-1.\n\nActions a_2 to a_{K-1}, resulting in y_K=9.\n\nThe sequence has H = K-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions starting from turn t1.\n\nt1=2.\n\nWe need to output actions from turn 2 to some turn.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nBut in the box, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach the position.\n\nStart at turn t1, after 0 actions, position (0,y_{t1})\n\nAfter 1 action, position at turn t1+1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nSo y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nAlso, for each turn tau from t1 to t1 + H -1, when at position (0,y_tau), no collision at turn tau.\n\nAt turn tau, position is (0,y_tau), and we check collision based on y_tau and cars at turn tau.\n\nNow, since the player moves during the turn, but as per note, when you choose to move to y_{tau+1} at turn tau, you are not on y_{tau+1} until turn tau+1, so at turn tau, you are on y_tau, and only check cars for freeway y_tau at turn tau.\n\nSimilarly, at turn tau+1, you are on y_{tau+1}, check for that.\n\nNow for the goal, at turn t1 + H, position (0,9), and since y=9 has no cars, no collision, but we need to ensure no collision during the path.\n\nNow, y=9 is safe, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, from y=1 to y=9, minimal steps: need to increase y by 8, so at least 8 up moves, but we can stay or go down, so minimal H is at least 8, meaning from turn 2 to turn 10, y_10=9, with 8 actions: a2 to a9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's list the collision times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): collision only at T=6\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): collision at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): collision at T=2,3,8,9\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): collision at T=2,3,8,9\n\nPlayer starts at turn 2, y=1.\n\nAt turn 2, y=1, which is freeway 1, collision at T=6, but T=2 is not 6, so at T=2, on y=1, no collision? Freeway 1 has collision only at T=6, so at T=2, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 and y=8, collision at T=2 and T=3.\n\nAt turn 2, if player is on y=7 or y=8, collision, but player is on y=1, so ok.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nThe critical points are around T=6 for y=1, T=8,9 for y=2 to 6, and T=2,3 for y=7,8.\n\nBut T=2 and 3 are early, and player is at y=1, so y=7 and 8 are far, not issue at start.\n\nPlayer needs to go up to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but let's see the times.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn.\n\nStart turn 2, y=1, no collision (since T=2 not 6 for y=1)\n\na2=U, then y3=2\n\nTurn 3, y=2, freeway 2, collision at T=8,9; T=3 not 8 or 9, so no collision.\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4, y=3, freeway 3, collision at T=8,9; T=4 not, so no.\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nTurn 5, y=4, freeway 4, collision at T=8,9; T=5 not, no collision.\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nTurn 6, y=5, freeway 5, collision at T=8,9; T=6 not, so no collision. Freeway 5 has collision only at T=8,9, so at T=6, no issue.\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nTurn 7, y=6, freeway 6, collision at T=8,9; T=7 not, no collision.\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nTurn 8, y=7, freeway 7, which has collision at T=2,3,8,9. T=8 is collision time, so if at turn 8, y=7, collision occurs.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, at turn 8, y=7, collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at turn 8 or 9 might be issue.\n\nIn this path, at turn 8, y=7, which is bad.\n\nWe could wait or go down at some point.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 have collision at early times T=2,3, but those are past, so for later times, only T=8,9 are issues for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, only T=6 is issue, but in the path above, at turn 6, y=5, not y=1, so no issue.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=7, collision.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps go slower or faster.\n\nMinimal time: to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up, so at least 8 actions, reaching at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: y=9.\n\nIn the sequence: after a2 to a9, y10=9.\n\nThe turns with position: turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nWe need no collision from turn 2 to turn 9, since at turn 10, y=9, safe.\n\nCollision check at turn T for T=2 to 9.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nTurn 2: y=1, safe (not T=6)\n\nTurn 3: y=2, safe (not 8 or 9)\n\nTurn 4: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=5, safe (freeway 5, collision only T=8,9, T=6 not)\n\nTurn 7: y=6, safe (freeway 6, T=8,9)\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7, collision at T=8, yes, bad\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8, collision at T=9? T=9 is collision for y=8? Freeway 8 collision at T=2,3,8,9, so T=9 yes.\n\nBut even at turn 8, y=7, collision.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=7 at turn 8 or on y=8 at turn 9? But also y=7 at turn 9 might be issue, but in path, turn 9 y=8.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Be on y=7 at a different time, not turn 8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and minimal steps, we might add a stay or down move to delay.\n\nFor example, at some point, stay instead of up.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nGo down to y=0 to avoid, but y=0 safe, but might take more time.\n\nFirst, let's list the forbidden (y,T) pairs.\n\nFor freeway k, collision at T means that if player is on y=k at turn T, collision.\n\nSo forbidden states: (y,T) where y has collision at T.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: T=6\n\ny=2: T=8,9\n\ny=3: T=8,9\n\ny=4: T=8,9\n\ny=5: T=8,9\n\ny=6: T=8,9\n\ny=7: T=2,3,8,9\n\ny=8: T=2,3,8,9\n\nNow, player path: start (y=1,T=2)\n\nGoal: reach (y=9,T) for some T, but since y=9 safe, any T.\n\nBut we want minimal T.\n\nSince from turn 2, y=1, to y=9, at least 7 steps up? From y=1 to y=9, delta y=8, so need at least 8 steps if all up, but with stays or down, more.\n\nMinimal T: at turn 2, y=1; if go up every turn, y=2 at T=3, y=3 at T=4, ..., y=8 at T=9, y=9 at T=10.\n\nSo T=10 is earliest possible with all up.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid the forbidden points.\n\nIn the path to T=10:\n\nPossible collisions at:\n\n- At T=8, if y=7, forbidden\n\n- At T=9, if y=8, forbidden (since y=8 collision at T=9)\n\nAlso, at T=6, if y=1, forbidden, but in path y=5 at T=6, not y=1.\n\nNow, to avoid (y=7,T=8) and (y=8,T=9)\n\nWe could:\n\n- Be at y=7 at a different time, not T=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nFor example, if we go faster, but we start at T=2 y=1, to reach y=9 earlier? But we can only go up one per turn, so cannot reach before T=10. y=9 at T=10 is earliest.\n\nWe can reach later.\n\nBut minimal H, so we want T=10 if possible.\n\nAt T=10, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid the forbidden points.\n\nIn the direct path, we have issue at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8, we are at y=7, which is bad.\n\nAt T=9, we are at y=8, which is also bad for freeway 8 at T=9.\n\nSo both points are problematic.\n\nWe need to change the path so that at T=8, we are not on y=7, and at T=9 not on y=8.\n\nBut since we need to go through y=7 and y=8 at some point.\n\ny=7 must be visited between T=3 and T=9 or something.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe safe times for y=7: not T=2,3,8,9, so T=4,5,6,7,10,... but T=10 y=9, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, safe times not T=2,3,8,9, so T=4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nNow, in the minimal time path, we are at y=7 at T=7? Let's list the desired y over time.\n\nAt T=2: y=1\n\nT=3: y=2\n\nT=4: y=3\n\nT=5: y=4\n\nT=6: y=5\n\nT=7: y=6\n\nT=8: y=7 → bad\n\nT=9: y=8 → bad\n\nT=10: y=9\n\nWe need to modify so that at T=8, y not 7, and at T=9, y not 8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, instead of y=6, we could be at y=7 or y=5 or something.\n\nLet's think of possible actions.\n\nStart T=2, y=1, must choose a2.\n\nIf a2=S, then y3=1, then at T=3, y=1.\n\nBut y=1 at T=3: freeway 1 collision only at T=6, so T=3 not, so safe, but we waste time.\n\nSimilarly, if a2=D, y3=0, then at T=3, y=0, safe, but then need to go up later.\n\nBut going down might increase time.\n\nTo avoid (7,8) and (8,9), we can shift the times.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at T=7 instead of T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=7 or T=10, but T=10 y=9.\n\nAt T=7, if y=7, is it safe? y=7 at T=7: freeway 7 collision at T=2,3,8,9, not T=7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=7: freeway 8 collision at T=2,3,8,9, not T=7, so safe.\n\nThen at T=8, if we are not on y=7 or y=8, but on another y.\n\nBut y=6 at T=8? y=6 collision at T=8,9? Freeway 6 collision at T=8,9, so if at T=8 y=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=8, collision, etc.\n\nFor y=2 to 6, all have collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nExcept y=1 at T=8: freeway 1 collision only T=6, not T=8, so safe.\n\ny=0 or y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=8, the only safe y are y=0,1,9, but y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, safe y are y=0,1,9 or others? y=1 at T=9: freeway 1 no collision except T=6, so safe. y=0 safe. y=9 safe. But y=2 to 8 all collision at T=9? y=2: collision T=8,9; y=3 same; ... y=8 collision T=8,9; y=7 collision T=8,9; so all y=2 to 8 have collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThus at T=8 and T=9, the only safe positions are y=0, y=1, or y=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y=9 not reachable since from y=1 at T=2, need 7 steps to y=8, but T=8 is only 6 steps later, turn 2 to turn 8 is 6 turns? Turns: T=2 to T=8, positions from y2 to y8.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=8, there are 6 actions (a2 to a7) to set y3 to y8.\n\nAt T=2, y=1\n\nAfter a2, y3\n\n...\n\nAfter a7, y8\n\nTo have y8=9, but from y=1 to y=9, need +8, so with 6 actions, impossible to reach y=9; max y=1+6=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9, after 7 actions, y9 = y2 + sum Δy from 2 to 8, 7 actions, max y=1+7=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=9, need 7 actions: from T=2 to T=9, 7 actions, y9=9.\n\nBut at T=9, if y=9, safe, but during path, we have issues.\n\nBack to avoiding T=8 and T=9 for y=2 to 8.\n\nSince at T=8 and T=9, we must be at y=0 or y=1 to be safe.\n\ny=1 is safe at T=8 and T=9, since no collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSo perhaps at T=8, be at y=1, then go up later.\n\nBut that would take more time.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to some point, then before T=8, go down to y=1 or y=0.\n\nLet's list the path with times.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at T=10 or later.\n\nFirst, try to reach at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=10, but y max 9, so y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen positions from T=2 to T=9 need to be safe.\n\nT=2 to T=9: 8 positions.\n\nWe need to have y_T for T=2 to9.\n\ny_2=1\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At T=6, y=1 forbidden\n\n- At T=8, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 forbidden, so must be y=0 or y=1\n\n- At T=9, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 forbidden, so must be y=0,1,9\n\nBut at T=9, if we can be at y=9, that's good for goal, but we need to reach by T=10.\n\nAt T=9, if y=9, then we are done at turn 9, but we start at turn 2, to reach turn 9, that would be faster, but from y=1 at T=2 to y=9 at T=9, that requires y=9 at T=9, so after 7 actions, from a2 to a8, y9=9.\n\nT=9: position after actions up to a8.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter actions from turn 2 to turn T-1, we have y_T.\n\nFor y_T=9 at turn T.\n\nIf T=9, then y9=9, which is great, but is it possible? From y2=1 to y9=9 in 7 steps? Actions a2 to a8, 7 actions, each can increase y by at most 1, so y9 <= y2 +7 =1+7=8, so y9=8 max with 7 actions, cannot reach y=9 at T=9.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y=9 is T=10, with y10=9, after 8 actions a2 to a9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 <=8.\n\nSo at T=9, y9 <=8, and since y=2 to8 forbidden, must be y=0 or y=1 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, must be y=0 or y=1.\n\nAt T=6, must not be y=1.\n\nNow, from start, y2=1.\n\nAt T=2, y=1, safe since not T=6.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=0 or y=1 by T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut we also need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSo one way is to go down to y=0 before T=8, stay there or something.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible before, but need to be low at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=6, we can go up, but avoid y=1 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, we need y6 !=1.\n\nAlso, at T=8 and T=9, y=0 or 1.\n\nFirst, let's list the required y at critical times.\n\nAt T=8: y=0 or 1\n\nAt T=9: y=0 or 1\n\nAt T=6: y !=1\n\nNow, y2=1\n\nWe need to move to satisfy these.\n\nAlso, to reach y=9 at T=10, we need y9=8 or something, but at T=9, y must be 0 or 1, so y9=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, to y10=9, need to go up, but y10=9 is after action a9.\n\nAt T=10, y10=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nThen from y9=0 or 1, to y10=9, impossible because can only change by +1 per turn.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9, so if y9=0, y10=1 max; if y9=1, y10=0,1,2 max, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=10 if we must have y9=0 or 1.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nIf we reach later, say T=11, y11=9.\n\nThen at T=10, y10 must be 8, so that a10=U to y11=9.\n\nBut at T=9, we can have other y.\n\nLet's not fix the arrival time.\n\nWe need minimal H such that after H actions, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn tau from 2 to 2+H-1, the position y_tau is safe.\n\nAt turn tau=2+H, y=9, safe.\n\nSo the collision checks are for tau=2 to 2+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=8, arrive at turn 10, check turns 2 to 9.\n\nIf H=9, arrive at turn 11, check turns 2 to 10, etc.\n\nFirst, with H=8, we need to avoid the forbidden points from T=2 to9.\n\nBut as above, at T=8 and T=9, we must be at y=0 or y=1, but with H=8, at T=9, y9 must be 8 to reach y10=9, but y9=8 is forbidden at T=9, and we cannot have y9=0 or 1 because then y10 cannot be 9.\n\nSpecifically, for H=8, y10=9, so y9 must be 8 or 9, but y9=9 impossible as earlier, so y9=8, then a9=U to y10=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8, which is forbidden for freeway 8 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y9=9, impossible.\n\nSo for H=8, at T=9, y9 must be 8, which is forbidden.\n\nMoreover, at T=8, in the path, y8 must be 7 or 8 or something, but also forbidden if not 0 or 1.\n\nBut specifically, since y9=8 required for H=8, and it is forbidden, so H=8 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for any arrival at turn K, with y_K=9, then at turn K-1, y_{K-1} must be 8 or 9, but y=9 impossible to reach from below in one step, so y_{K-1}=8.\n\nThen at turn K-1, y=8, which must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn K-2, y=7 or 8 or 9, etc.\n\nBut in this case, for y=8, it is safe only when T not in {2,3,8,9}\n\nSimilarly for y=7, safe when T not in {2,3,8,9}\n\nNow for minimal K, K=10, then at T=9, y=8, which must be safe, but at T=9, y=8 is not safe, as collision.\n\nIf K=11, arrive at T=11, y11=9.\n\nThen at T=10, y10 must be 8 (since y11= y10 + Δy10, so y10=8, a10=U).\n\nAt T=10, y=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 collision at T=2,3,8,9, not T=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y9 could be 7,8, or 9, but y9=9 impossible, so y9=7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=9, if y9=8, forbidden; if y9=7, also forbidden at T=9 for freeway 7.\n\nSo at T=9, y must not be 7 or 8, but must be 0 or 1 to be safe, since all other y have collision at T=9.\n\ny=2 to 6 also collision at T=9.\n\nSo at T=9, must be y=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly for T=8.\n\nBut for K=11, we have turns from 2 to 10 to check.\n\nAt T=9, we need y9=0 or 1.\n\nThen from y9=0 or 1, to y10=8? y10 must be 8 for y11=9.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nIf y9=0, y10 <=1\n\nIf y9=1, y10<=2\n\nCannot reach y10=8.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly for any K, to have y_K=9, we need y_{K-1}=8.\n\nAnd at turn K-1, y=8 must be safe.\n\nAlso, for the path to be possible, we need to reach y=8 at some point before.\n\nBut the problem is at T=8 and T=9, we are forced to be low.\n\nLet's list the safe y for each T.\n\nFor each turn T, which y are safe.\n\nT=2: y=1 safe (not T=6), y=2 safe (not 8,9), similarly y=3,4,5,6 safe, y=7 unsafe (collision T=2), y=8 unsafe (T=2), y=0 and 9 safe.\n\nAt T=2, y=7 and y=8 unsafe, but player is at y=1, safe.\n\nT=3: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, ..., y=6 safe, y=7 unsafe (T=3), y=8 unsafe, y=0,9 safe.\n\nT=4: all y safe except if there are collisions, but from the list, only specific T have collisions for each y.\n\nFor T=4:\n\ny=1: collision only T=6, so safe at T=4\n\ny=2: collision T=8,9, not T=4, safe\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6: safe\n\ny=7: collision T=2,3,8,9, not T=4, safe\n\ny=8: collision T=2,3,8,9, not T=4, safe\n\ny=0,9 safe.\n\nSo at T=4, all y safe.\n\nSimilarly T=5: same, no collisions for any y at T=5, since only T=6 for y=1, etc.\n\nT=6: y=1 unsafe (collision), y=2 safe (not 8,9), similarly y=3,4,5,6 safe, y=7 safe (not collision T), y=8 safe, y=0,9 safe.\n\nT=7: all y safe, similar to T=4,5.\n\nT=8: y=1 safe, y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, y=6 unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe, only y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable.\n\nT=9: similarly, only y=0,1,9 safe.\n\nT=10: all y safe, since no collisions at T=10 for any, as per the car positions.\n\nFor example, y=1 at T=10: freeway 1 collision only T=6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nT=11, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some K.\n\nMinimal K=10.\n\nBut for K=10, we need y10=9, so y9=8.\n\nAt T=9, y9=8, but at T=9, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we have y9=8, it is forbidden.\n\nSo for K=10, impossible because it requires y9=8 which is unsafe at T=9.\n\nNext, K=11, y11=9, so y10=8.\n\nAt T=10, y10=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 collision at T=2,3,8,9, not T=10, so safe.\n\nAt T=9, y9 must be such that we can reach y10=8.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9, so y9 can be 7,8,9.\n\nBut at T=9, y9 must be safe. At T=9, safe y are y=0,1,9.\n\ny9=9 impossible, so y9 must be 0 or 1.\n\nThen from y9=0 or 1, y10 = y9 + Δy9 <=1+1=2 or 0+1=1, so y10 <=2, cannot be 8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSimilarly, for K=12, y12=9, so y11=8.\n\nAt T=11, y11=8, safe as above.\n\nAt T=10, y10 must be 7,8,9 for y11=8.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10, so if y11=8, y10 can be 7,8,9.\n\nAt T=10, all y safe, as no collisions.\n\nAt T=9, y9 must be safe, so y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from y9=0 or 1, to y10, y10 <=2.\n\nThen to y11=8, impossible from y10<=2 in one step.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo we need to have y higher at earlier times to reach.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we must be low.\n\nSo perhaps be at high y before T=8, then go down to y=0 or 1 at T=8 and T=9, then go up to y=9 later.\n\nFor example, reach y=8 by T=7, then at T=8 go down to y=7 or something, but at T=8, y must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nSuppose we go up quickly to y=8 by T=7.\n\nAt T=2, y2=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\nBut at T=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo have y8 low.\n\nFrom above, at T=7, y7 can be high.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y7=8.\n\nIs it safe? T=7, y=8, freeway 8 collision at T=2,3,8,9, not T=7, so safe.\n\nThen at T=8, we need y8=0 or 1.\n\nBut y8 = y7 + Δy7, so from y7=8, if a7=D, y8=7, but at T=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf a7=D, y8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=8, unsafe at T=8.\n\nIf a7=U, y8=9, but y=9 safe at T=8, since no cars.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nSo from y7=8, a7=U, y8=9.\n\nThen at T=8, y=9, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, we need y9 safe. At T=9, safe y are y=0,1,9.\n\nIf y8=9, then a8 can be S or D.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=9, safe.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=8, unsafe at T=9.\n\nBut we can choose a8=S, so y9=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=9, safe.\n\nThen we are at y=9, but we need to reach (0,9), so at T=9, position (0,9), so we can stop.\n\nWith y9=9 at T=9.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nFrom above: start T=2 y=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7? Let's list:\n\nAfter a2: T=3 y=2\n\na3: T=4 y=3\n\na4: T=5 y=4\n\na5: T=6 y=5\n\na6: T=7 y=6\n\na7: T=8 y=7\n\nBut at T=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo have y7=8, we need to go faster.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=2 to y=8 at T=7.\n\nThat requires increasing y by 7 in 5 actions: from a2 to a6 for y7.\n\ny7 is set after a6.\n\nAt T=2, y2=1\n\nAfter a2, y3\n\nAfter a3, y4\n\nAfter a4, y5\n\nAfter a5, y6\n\nAfter a6, y7\n\nSo 5 actions to go from y2=1 to y7.\n\nMax y7 =1 +5 =6 if all up.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at T=7.\n\nMax at T=7 is y=6.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=8 at T=8, with 6 actions, max y=1+6=7.\n\nSo at T=8, y8 <=7.\n\nCannot be 8 or 9.\n\nBack to the idea.\n\nTo be at high y before T=8, then go down.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y7=6 (max)\n\nThen at T=8, we need y8=0 or 1.\n\nBut from y7=6, a7=D, y8=5, but at T=8, y=5 unsafe.\n\na7=D, y8=5\n\na7=S, y8=6, unsafe\n\na7=U, y8=7, unsafe\n\nAll unsafe at T=8 except if y8=0 or 1, but from y7=6, cannot reach y=0 or 1 in one step.\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7, so from 6, y8=5,6,7, all unsafe at T=8.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at T=8 from y7=6.\n\nSimilarly, if y7=5, etc., same issue.\n\nSo the only way is to be at low y at T=7 to reach y=0 or 1 at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y7=1, then a7=D to y8=0, or a7=S to y8=1.\n\nBoth safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nBut at T=7, y7=1, is it safe? T=7, y=1, freeway 1 collision only at T=6, not T=7, so safe.\n\nThen at T=8, y8=0 or 1, safe.\n\nAt T=9, we need y9=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y8, if y8=0, a8=S, y9=0; or a8=U, y9=1\n\nIf y8=1, a8=S, y9=1; or a8=D, y9=0; or a8=U, y9=2 but y=2 unsafe at T=9.\n\nSo we can have a8 such that y9=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, a8=S if y8=1, or a8=U if y8=0 to y9=1, etc.\n\nThen at T=9, y9=0 or 1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9 later.\n\nFor example, after T=9, go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, we need to handle T=6.\n\nFirst, let's outline the path.\n\nStart T=2, y2=1\n\nWe need to have at T=7, y7=1, for example.\n\nThen from T=2 to T=7, we need to go from y=1 to y=1, so net zero change in 5 turns.\n\nWe can go up and down or stay.\n\nBut we also have T=6 to avoid y=1.\n\nAt T=6, y6 must not be 1.\n\nSo if we want y7=1, that means at T=6, y6 could be 0,1,2, and a6 such that y7=1.\n\nBut at T=6, y6 must not be 1.\n\nSo y6 could be 0 or 2.\n\nThen from there to y7=1.\n\nNow, let's define the actions.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=7, 5 actions (a2 to a6) to set y3 to y7, with y7=1.\n\ny7 = y2 + sum_{t=2 to6} Δy_t =1 + sum Δy for 5 actions.\n\nWe want y7=1, so sum Δy =0.\n\nAlso, at each turn, safe.\n\nAnd at T=6, y6 !=1.\n\nNow, T=2: y2=1, safe\n\na2: choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf a2=U, y3=2\n\nIf a2=S, y3=1\n\nIf a2=D, y3=0\n\nThen T=3: y3, must be safe. T=3, safe for y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have sum Δy=0 over 5 actions.\n\nAnd y6 !=1.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid other collisions, but mostly ok.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=1 for some turns.\n\nBut at T=6, cannot be at y=1.\n\nSo we need to be away at T=6.\n\nFor instance, go down to y=0 and come back.\n\nLet's list the positions.\n\nT=2: y=1\n\nSuppose a2=S, then y3=1, T=3 y=1 safe\n\na3=S, y4=1, T=4 y=1 safe\n\na4=S, y5=1, T=5 y=1 safe (T=5 no collision)\n\na5: at T=5, we need to set y6.\n\nSince at T=6, y6 cannot be 1, so a5 cannot be S if y5=1.\n\nIf y5=1, a5 can be U or D.\n\nSuppose a5=U, then y6=2, T=6 y=2, safe (not 8 or 9)\n\nThen a6: to set y7=1, so from y6=2, a6 must be D, so y7=1.\n\nThen T=7 y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a5=D, y6=0, T=6 y=0 safe, then a6=U, y7=1.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nNow, we have y7=1.\n\nThen at T=7, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, for T=8: we need y8=0 or 1.\n\na7: from y7=1, if a7=S, y8=1; if a7=D, y8=0; if a7=U, y8=2 but at T=8 y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo we can a7=S or D.\n\nSay a7=S, then y8=1, T=8 y=1 safe.\n\nOr a7=D, y8=0, T=8 y=0 safe.\n\nThen T=9: need y9=0 or 1.\n\nIf y8=1, a8=S, y9=1 safe.\n\nOr if y8=0, a8=U, y9=1 safe; or a8=S, y9=0 safe.\n\nNow, we are at T=9 with y9=0 or 1.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom here, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 8 or 9.\n\nFor example, if y9=1, then to y10, y10<=2, y11<=3, ..., up to y17=9 at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, if y9=0, even later.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nSince at T=10 and later, no collision issues, we can go up directly.\n\nBut minimal H.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAfter actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nWith y9=1 at T=9, we can start going up.\n\nFrom T=9, y9=1\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nup to a16=U, y17=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a2 to a16, that's 15 actions? Turns: actions from t=2 to t=16 for y17=9.\n\nH actions from t1 to t1+H-1, position at t1+H.\n\nt1=2, position at 2+H.\n\nSet 2+H=17, so H=15.\n\nBut this is large.\n\nWe can reach earlier if we go up before the critical times.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 or 7 by T=7, but then at T=8 we need to be low, which we can't from high.\n\nEarlier we saw it's difficult.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=6, y=1 is forbidden, but other y are safe, so at T=6, we can be at y=2, for example.\n\nThen after T=9, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we must be low.\n\nSo let's be at high y before T=8, but since we can't stay high at T=8, we need to go down before.\n\nBut from high y, going down takes time.\n\nFor example, suppose we reach y=6 at T=6.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=8, two turns, to go to y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y=6, a6=D, y7=5\n\na7=D, y8=4, but at T=8, y=4 unsafe.\n\nOr to reach y=1 from y=6 in two steps: a6=D, y7=5; a7=D, y8=4, not 1.\n\nCannot reach y=0 or 1 in two steps from y=6.\n\nMinimal steps to y=0 from y=6 is 6 steps down.\n\nSimilarly, not efficient.\n\nSo the only practical way is to stay low or go down early to be at y=0 or 1 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nNow to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible before, but avoid the forbidden at T=6.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=5, we can go up to y=5 or something.\n\nAt T=2, y=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nT=5 y=4, safe\n\nNow at T=5, we need to set y6.\n\nAt T=6, y6 cannot be 1, but can be other.\n\nAlso, we need to be low at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut T=8 is after, so let's set for T=6.\n\nSuppose a5=U, y6=5, T=6 y=5, safe (freeway 5 collision only T=8,9, not T=6)\n\nThen T=6 y=5\n\nNow a6: to go down or something.\n\nBut at T=7, we can be at y=5 or less.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 or 1 at T=8.\n\nFrom T=6 y=5, to T=8 y=0 or 1, need to decrease by 4 or 5 in two steps.\n\nImpossible.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=8, two actions: a6 and a7 for y7 and y8.\n\ny8 depends on a7.\n\nWith y6=5, after a6, y7 = y6 + Δy6, so 4,5,6\n\nThen after a7, y8 = y7 + Δy7, so from 4,5,6, y8=3,4,5,6,7, all unsafe at T=8 except if 0 or 1, impossible.\n\nSo from y=5 at T=6, cannot reach safe y at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we are lower at T=6.\n\nSuppose at T=6, we are at y=2.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start: T=2 y=1\n\na2=S, y3=1\n\na3=U, y4=2\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\na5=D, y6=2  (since at T=6 cannot be 1)\n\nT=6 y=2, safe\n\nThen at T=6 y=2\n\nNow to T=8, need y8=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y=2, with two actions.\n\na6: from y6=2, a6 can be D or S or U.\n\nIf a6=D, y7=1\n\nThen a7: from y7=1, to have y8=0 or 1, a7=S or D.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=1; a7=D, y8=0.\n\nBoth safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if a6=S, y7=2, then to have y8=0 or 1, a7 must be D, y8=1 or if y7=2, a7=D, y8=1, or a7=U, y8=3 unsafe, so a7=D, y8=1.\n\nOr from y7=2, a7=D, y8=1.\n\nIf a6=U, y7=3, then a7 must make y8=0 or 1, impossible, y8=2,3,4, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible if a6=D or S, leading to y7=1 or 2, then a7=D to y8=1 or 0.\n\nSpecifically, with a6=D, y7=1, then a7=S or D for y8=1 or 0.\n\nOr a6=S, y7=2, a7=D, y8=1.\n\nThen at T=8, y=0 or 1, safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nNow at T=8, suppose y8=1.\n\nThen for T=9, need y9=0 or 1.\n\na8: from y8=1, a8=S, y9=1; or a8=D, y9=0; both safe.\n\nOr if y8=0, a8=S, y9=0; a8=U, y9=1.\n\nThen at T=9, y9=0 or 1.\n\nNow, from here, we can go up to y=9.\n\nFor example, y9=1.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=15 actions from t=2 to t=16.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nIn the above, from T=2 to T=6, we have y=2 at T=6, but we could be higher.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=5, go up.\n\nT=2 y=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nT=5 y=4\n\nNow at T=5, set y6.\n\nAt T=6, y6 cannot be 1, so a5 can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf a5=U, y6=5\n\nIf a5=S, y6=4\n\nIf a5=D, y6=3\n\nAll not 1, so safe at T=6.\n\nSuppose we want to be higher to reduce the later steps.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to be low, so being high early doesn't help much, since we have to go down later.\n\nFor example, with y5=4 at T=5.\n\nThen to have y8=0 or 1, we need to decrease from y=4 at T=5 to y=0 or 1 at T=8 in three steps.\n\nFrom T=5 to T=8, actions a5,a6,a7 for y6,y7,y8.\n\nWith y5=4, after a5, y6=3,4,5\n\nThen a6, y7=2,3,4,5,6\n\nThen a7, y8=1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nWe need y8=0 or 1.\n\nSo possible if we go down: e.g. a5=D, y6=3\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\na7=D, y8=1\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nThen at T=8, y8=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=9.\n\nThen from y8=1, go up.\n\nBut the number of steps to go up from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, to turn 16 or 17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo minimize, we should avoid going down too much, but we have to be low at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThe minimal H is achieved by being as high as possible before, but since we have to drop to low at T=8 and T=9, the cost is fixed.\n\nThe earliest we can reach y=9 is after T=9.\n\nFrom T=9 y=1, go up 8 steps to y=9 at T=17.\n\nH=15 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by being higher at T=9, but at T=9 we must be y=0 or 1, so no.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at T=10, but we saw it's impossible.\n\nAnother thought: is there a way to be at y=9 at T=10 without being at y=8 at T=9? No, because y10 = y9 + Δy9, so if y10=9, y9 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny9=9 impossible, so y9=8.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8 is unsafe, so impossible for T=10 arrival.\n\nSimilarly for T=11, y11=9 requires y10=8, which at T=10 is safe, but y10=8 requires y9, which at T=9 must be 7,8,9, but y9=7 or 8 unsafe at T=9, y9=9 impossible, so no possible y9 to reach y10=8.\n\nBecause y9 must be 0 or 1 at T=9, then y10 <=2.\n\nSo indeed, it is impossible to reach y=9 before T=17 with the constraints.\n\nBut let's check T=17.\n\nAt T=17, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, the path from T=2 to T=9 must be safe, and at T=8 and T=9, y=0 or 1.\n\nFor example, one path:\n\nT=2: y=1, safe\n\na2=S, y3=1, T=3 y=1 safe\n\na3=S, y4=1, T=4 y=1 safe\n\na4=S, y5=1, T=5 y=1 safe\n\na5=U, y6=2, T=6 y=2 safe (since not 1, and not collision time)\n\na6=D, y7=1, T=7 y=1 safe\n\na7=S, y8=1, T=8 y=1 safe\n\na8=S, y9=1, T=9 y=1 safe\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nSo at turn 17, position (0,9)\n\nNumber of actions: from a2 to a16, 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nSequence of actions for t from 2 to 16.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from t1 to t1+H-1, so for t=2 to 2+15-1=16, yes.\n\nMinimal H is 15.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nT=2 y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nT=5 y=4\n\nThen a5=D, y6=3, T=6 y=3 safe\n\na6=D, y7=2, T=7 y=2 safe\n\na7=D, y8=1, T=8 y=1 safe\n\na8=S, y9=1, T=9 y=1 safe\n\nThen same as before, a9 to a16 up to y17=9, but from y9=1, need 8 ups to y17=9, actions a9 to a16.\n\na9: y10=2, ..., a16: y17=9.\n\nSame H=15.\n\nFrom T=5 y=4, if we go down faster, but we need to reach y=1 at T=8, so a5=D, y6=3; a6=D, y7=2; a7=D, y8=1; same as above.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nTo have y8=0, but similar.\n\nSo H=15 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision at other points.\n\nFor example, at T=6, in this path, y=3 or 2, not 1, and freeway 3 collision only at T=8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAt T=7, y=2 or 1, safe.\n\nAt T=10 to T=16, all safe since no cars at T=10+.\n\nSo this works.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the first path I had some stays, but we can reduce the stays by going up earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=4, go up, then down to low for T=8.\n\nBut still, from high to low takes steps, and then up, same number.\n\nFor instance:\n\nT=2 y=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4  (now at T=5 y=4)\n\nThen need to go to y=1 at T=8.\n\na5=D, y6=3\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\na7=D, y8=1\n\nT=8 y=1\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen a9=U to a16=U as before.\n\nStill 15 actions.\n\nIf at T=5 y=4, we go down slower, but then we might not reach y=1 at T=8.\n\nFor example, a5=S, y6=4; then a6=D, y7=3; a7=D, y8=2, but at T=8 y=2 unsafe, must be 0 or 1.\n\nSo y8 must be 0 or 1, so we need to decrease sufficiently.\n\nThus, minimal H is 15.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions from turn t1=2 to turn 2+H-1.\n\nH=15, so actions from turn 2 to turn 16.\n\nSequence: let's use the first path with some stays, but to make it simple, we can have a direct up then down.\n\nBut since we need to avoid y=1 at T=6, we can adjust.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: action a2, since y2=1, and we can go U or S.\n\nSet a2=U, so y3=2\n\nTurn 3: y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: y=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nTurn 5: y=4, a5=U, y6=5  (now at T=6 y=5, not 1, safe)\n\nThen from here, we need to go down to y=1 for T=8.\n\nT=6 y=5\n\na6=D, y7=4\n\nBut at T=7, we can be at y=4, safe.\n\nThen a7=D, y8=3? But we need y8=0 or 1.\n\ny8=3 at T=8 unsafe.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom T=6 y=5, to have y8=1, we need two down actions.\n\na6=D, y7=4\n\na7=D, y8=3, not 1.\n\nCannot reach y=1 in two steps from y=5.\n\nFrom y=5, to y=1, need at least 4 down actions.\n\nFor example, a6=D, y7=4; a7=D, y8=3; then at T=8 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we must be lower at T=6 to reach y=0 or 1 at T=8 with few steps.\n\nIn the earlier path with y=2 at T=6, we can reach y=1 at T=8 with one down.\n\nBut from T=2 to T=6, if we start from y=1, to have y=2 at T=6, we need only +1 in 4 actions, so we can have stays or one up.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=2: y=1, a2=S, y3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, a3=S, y4=1\n\nT=4: y=1, a4=U, y5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, a5=S, y6=2  (T=6 y=2)\n\nThen a6=D, y7=1\n\na7=S, y8=1  (T=8 y=1)\n\na8=S, y9=1\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nUp to a16=U, y17=9\n\nActions: a2=S, a3=S, a4=U, a5=S, a6=D, a7=S, a8=S, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U\n\nThat's 15 actions.\n\nTo save one action, but we have to have the down moves.\n\nSince at T=9 we are at y=1, and we go up 8 times, it takes 8 turns.\n\nThe minimal H is 15.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from 2 to 16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, from turn 2 to turn 16, actions.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo for this path:\n\nTurn 2: S (since a2=S)\n\nBut in the path above, a2=S.\n\nWe can have a2=U to be higher faster, but then we need more down later, same.\n\nI think H=15 is minimal.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 15.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter a16, y17=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=2 to t=16, H=15 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's make sure that at each turn, no collision.\n\nT=2: y=1, action S, but collision at position, not during action.\n\nAt turn T, we check y_T.\n\nT=2: y=1, freeway 1, not collision time (only T=6), so safe.\n\nT=3: y=1, same, safe.\n\nT=4: y=1, safe.\n\nAfter a4=U, y5=2, T=5: y=2, freeway 2, collision at T=8,9, not T=5, safe.\n\nT=6: y=2, freeway 2, not collision time, safe.\n\na6=D, y7=1, T=7: y=1, freeway 1, not T=6, safe.\n\nT=8: y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nT=9: y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen T=10: y=2, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nTo have fewer stays, but not necessary.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 15. This requires 15 actions from turn 2 to turn 16, resulting in position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Avoid being at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6 (collision on freeway 1).\n- Be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at turns 8 and 9 (the only safe positions due to collisions on all other freeways).\n- Efficiently reach \\(y = 9\\) after turn 9, as there are no collision risks from turn 10 onwards.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 2**: Stay (S), position at turn 3 is \\((0, 1)\\).\n- **Turn 3**: Stay (S), position at turn 4 is \\((0, 1)\\).\n- **Turn 4**: Up (U), position at turn 5 is \\((0, 2)\\).\n- **Turn 5**: Stay (S), position at turn 6 is \\((0, 2)\\) (avoids \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6).\n- **Turn 6**: Down (D), position at turn 7 is \\((0, 1)\\).\n- **Turn 7**: Stay (S), position at turn 8 is \\((0, 1)\\) (safe at turn 8).\n- **Turn 8**: Stay (S), position at turn 9 is \\((0, 1)\\) (safe at turn 9).\n- **Turn 9**: Up (U), position at turn 10 is \\((0, 2)\\).\n- **Turn 10**: Up (U), position at turn 11 is \\((0, 3)\\).\n- **Turn 11**: Up (U), position at turn 12 is \\((0, 4)\\).\n- **Turn 12**: Up (U), position at turn 13 is \\((0, 5)\\).\n- **Turn 13**: Up (U), position at turn 14 is \\((0, 6)\\).\n- **Turn 14**: Up (U), position at turn 15 is \\((0, 7)\\).\n- **Turn 15**: Up (U), position at turn 16 is \\((0, 8)\\).\n- **Turn 16**: Up (U), position at turn 17 is \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turns 2-4: Position \\(y = 1\\), safe as freeway 1 only has collision at turn 6.\n- Turn 5: Position \\(y = 2\\), safe as freeway 2 only has collisions at turns 8 and 9.\n- Turn 6: Position \\(y = 2\\), safe (not collision time for freeway 2).\n- Turn 7: Position \\(y = 1\\), safe (not collision time for freeway 1).\n- Turn 8: Position \\(y = 1\\), safe (only \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) are safe at turn 8).\n- Turn 9: Position \\(y = 1\\), safe (only \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 1\\), or \\(y = 9\\) are safe at turn 9, but \\(y = 9\\) is not reachable yet).\n- Turns 10-16: Positions \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\), safe as no freeways have collisions at turns 10-16.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 3, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (unless already at 9)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (unless already at 0)\n  S: stay\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are only considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T. So if we move (say from y to y+1 at turn T), then at turn T we are on freeway y, and at turn T+1 we are on freeway y+1.\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=1.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=3. We will need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car at turn t1 with [h, tau] and direction and speed s:\n    Left-moving (which I assume is when direction is left? But note the table: all cars in this state are right-moving. The problem says:\n        Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        Right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) = (h, tau) and then the span at t1 is [tau, h]? Actually the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> at t1=3, the span is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tau to h? But note: in the update for right-moving, they write: \n    Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at T=t1, we have [tau, h]. But in the input, we have (head, tail) and then the direction. The problem does not explicitly say which is head and tail in terms of front and back, but note:\n\nIn the update for left-moving: they write [h, tau] and then subtract, so h is the front? Similarly, for right-moving, they write [tau, h] and then add, so h is the front? Actually, for right-moving, the car moves to the right, so the front (head) should be the rightmost. So at t1, the car is from tau (left end) to h (right end). \n\nBut in the input for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). \n  If we interpret as (head, tail) = (-36, -47) for a right-moving car, then at t1=3, the car is from -47 to -36? But then the head is at -36 and tail at -47? That doesn't make sense because -36 > -47. Actually, for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost point. So if the car is moving right, then the head is at -36 and the tail at -47 (so the car occupies from -47 to -36). But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tau to h. So if tau is -47 and h is -36, then the car is from -47 to -36. That is consistent.\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s):\n  if d is right: the car at time t1 occupies [tau, h] (with tau <= h, because it's an interval from left to right).\n  if d is left: the car at time t1 occupies [h, tau] (and we assume h <= tau? But note the example: (-36,-47,right,12): tau=-47, h=-36 -> so tau < h, and the car is [tau, h] = [-47,-36]. \n\nBut wait: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then updates by subtracting. So if we have a left-moving car with (h, tau) = (10, 20), then the car is from 10 to 20? But if it's moving left, the head (front) should be the leftmost? Actually, no: if moving left, the head is the leftmost? But in the update, they subtract: so the entire car moves left. So if the car is at [10,20] at t1 and moving left, then at T>t1, it becomes [10 - s*(T-t1), 20 - s*(T-t1)]. Then at T=t1, it's [10,20]. So the head (front) is 10 and the tail (back) is 20? That would be a car that is 11 units long? But then the direction is left: so the front is 10 and the tail is 20? That doesn't make sense because when moving left, the front (head) should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem does not specify the meaning of head and tail. We have to rely on the update formula.\n\nGiven the update formulas, we can interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  initial: [tau, h] (with tau <= h) -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> so the entire interval shifts right.\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n  initial: [h, tau] (and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]) -> so if the car moves left, then we must have h <= tau? Because the update subtracts and the interval shifts left. \n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left-moving.\n\nNow, looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> so tau=-47, h=-36, so the car at t1=3 is from -47 to -36.\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: each has one car: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> so from -41 to -30.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars: \n  (-30, -41, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nWait, for the third car on freeway 7 and 8: (42, 31, right, 6). This would imply tau=31, h=42? But then the car is from 31 to 42. However, note that in the update for right-moving, we require tau<=h? Here 31<=42, so that's fine.\n\nBut wait: the second car: (6, -5, right, 6) -> tau=-5, h=6 -> so the car is from -5 to 6.\n\nSo freeway 7 and 8 have three cars: \n  car1: [-41, -30] at t1=3\n  car2: [-5, 6] at t1=3\n  car3: [31,42] at t1=3\n\nNow, the player is at y=1 at turn 3. We need to move to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when there is a car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at that turn T.\n\nNote: the grid is vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are at y=1 to 8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? But note the collision condition: only when on freeway y_T (which is from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, we are safe (no freeway there).\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=1. We must leave y=1 as soon as possible because there is a car on freeway 1? Let's check freeway 1 at turn 3:\n\nFreeway 1: car: [-47, -36] at turn 3. Does this include 0? -47<=0<=-36? No, because 0 is greater than -36. So at turn 3, we are safe on freeway 1.\n\nBut we are at turn 3 at y=1. We are on freeway 1 at turn 3. The car on freeway 1 at turn 3: [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in this interval. So safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions to go from y=1 to y=9, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. We can only change by 1 per turn (or stay). We must not go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance: from 1 to 9 is 8, so at least 8 moves of 'U'. But we might have to wait (use 'S') to avoid collisions.\n\nWe will simulate the future car positions at each turn.\n\nWe are at turn 3 (current turn). We will consider turns starting from turn 3.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each future turn T (>=3) the positions of the cars on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only when we are on freeway k at turn T and 0 is in one of the car spans on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8, and turns from 3 onward until we reach 9.\n\nLet T = t1 + t = 3 + t, where t=0,1,2,... (t=0 is current turn, but we haven't taken an action yet? Actually, the problem says: we are at turn t1 (3) and we start by taking an action at turn t1. Then we move to the next state at turn t1+1.\n\nSo at turn 3: we are at y=1. Then we choose an action for turn 3, which will determine y at turn 4.\n\nBut note: at turn 3, we are already at y=1. The collision condition at turn 3: we are on freeway 1. We check freeway 1 at turn 3: \n  car: [ -47 - 12*(0), -36 - 12*(0) ]? Actually, at turn T=3 (which is T-t1=0), so the car is at [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nWe then take an action at turn 3.\n\nWe are going to simulate for each turn the car positions.\n\nLet me precompute the car positions for freeways 1 to 8 for a few turns (say until turn 20? we hope to finish in 8 to 10 turns?).\n\nFor a car on freeway k with (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1=3:\n\nAt turn T (>=3), the position for a right-moving car is:\n  [ tau + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3) ]\n\nWe need to know when 0 is in one of these intervals for a given freeway and turn.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: tau=-47, h=-36, s=12, right -> span at T: [ -47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3) ]\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5,6: \n  each has one car: tau=-41, h=-30, s=6 -> span at T: [ -41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3) ]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars:\n  car1: tau=-41, h=-30, s=6 -> [ -41+6*(T-3), -30+6*(T-3) ]\n  car2: tau=-5, h=6, s=6 -> [ -5+6*(T-3), 6+6*(T-3) ]\n  car3: tau=31, h=42, s=6 -> [31+6*(T-3), 42+6*(T-3)]\n\nWe are going to compute the times when 0 is in the span for each car.\n\nFreeway 1:\n  Condition: -47 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-3)\n  Solve:\n    -47 + 12*(T-3) <= 0  => 12*(T-3) <= 47 => T-3 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T <= 6.916 -> so T from 3 to 6? But also the upper bound: 0 <= -36+12*(T-3) => 12*(T-3) >= 36 => T-3>=3 => T>=6.\n  So T=6: \n      lower: -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n      upper: -36+36=0 -> so 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [a,b] inclusive? So at T=6: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included -> collision if on freeway 1 at turn 6.\n  T=7: [ -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeway 1 has a car that covers 0 only at T=6? But wait, T=6: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\n  Actually, let me check T=6: T-3=3 -> [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n  So freeway 1 is dangerous only at turn 6.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5,6 (each same car):\n  Condition: -41+6*(T-3) <= 0 <= -30+6*(T-3)\n\n  Lower: -41+6*(T-3) <= 0 => 6*(T-3) <=41 => T-3 <=41/6≈6.833 => T<=9.833 -> T=3 to 9?\n  Upper: 0<= -30+6*(T-3) => 6*(T-3)>=30 => T-3>=5 => T>=8.\n\n  So for T in [8,9]? Let's check:\n\n  T=8: T-3=5 -> [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n  T=9: [-41+6*6, -30+36] = [-41+36, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n  T=10: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeways 2-6 are dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: we have three cars.\n\nCar1: same as above: so dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nCar2: [-5+6*(T-3), 6+6*(T-3)]\n  Condition: -5+6*(T-3) <= 0 <= 6+6*(T-3)\n\n  Lower: -5+6*(T-3) <=0 => 6*(T-3)<=5 => T-3<=5/6≈0.833 => T<=3.833 -> so T=3? \n  But at T=3: [-5,6] -> 0 is included? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n  Also, the upper: 0<=6+6*(T-3) -> always true for T>=3.\n\n  So car2 on freeway7 and 8 is dangerous at T=3? \n    T=3: [ -5+0, 6+0] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included -> dangerous.\n\n  But wait, we are at turn 3 and we are at freeway 1, not 7 or 8. So we are safe at turn 3 on freeway1.\n\n  However, if we are on freeway7 at turn 3, we would be in danger. But we are not.\n\n  Now, what about future turns?\n    T=4: [ -5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n    T=5: [ -5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n  So car2 is only dangerous at T=3? \n\nCar3: [31+6*(T-3), 42+6*(T-3)]\n  Condition: 31+6*(T-3) <= 0 <= 42+6*(T-3) -> but 31+6*(T-3) is at least 31 (at T=3) and increases. So 0 is never in this interval.\n\nSo for freeway 7 and 8:\n  - At T=3: car2 is dangerous -> but we are not on freeway7 or 8 at T=3.\n  - Car1 is dangerous at T=8,9.\n  - Car2 is only dangerous at T=3? So for T>=4, car2 is not dangerous.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=6.\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=8,9.\nFreeway 3: same as 2: T=8,9.\nFreeway 4: same: T=8,9.\nFreeway 5: same: T=8,9.\nFreeway 6: same: T=8,9.\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=8,9 (from car1) and also at T=3 (from car2) but T=3 is over and we weren't there.\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nAdditionally, note that at T=3, freeway7 and 8 are dangerous? But we are at freeway1 at T=3, so we are safe.\n\nNow, we start at turn 3 at y=1.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At turn 6: if we are on freeway 1 (y=1) then we crash.\n\n- At turns 8 and 9: if we are on freeways 2 to 8 (y=2 to 8) then we crash? Actually, freeways 2-6 and 7,8 are dangerous at T=8,9. But note: freeway 1 is not dangerous at T=8,9? And freeway 9 doesn't exist (we are safe at y=9). \n\nBut wait: at T=8,9, freeway 2 to 8 are dangerous? Actually, freeway 7 and 8 are dangerous at T=8,9? Yes, because of car1. \n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThat means at turn 8 and 9, we must be at y=0 or y=9? But note: we are trying to get to y=9. If we can be at y=9 by turn 8, then at turn 8 we are at y=9 (safe) and then we are done? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence. \n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=0 at turn8 and 9? But then we have to get to y=9 eventually, which is 9 moves up.\n\nBut we have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe are at turn3: y=1.\n\nWe have 5 turns (from turn3 to turn7) to get to y=9? Or we might have to wait.\n\nBut note: if we go up every turn, we can:\n\nTurn3: U -> y=2 at turn4? \n  Actually: \n    Turn3: start at y=1, take action U -> at the end of turn3, we move to y=2? \n    But the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, so at turn t1=3, we take action a_3 -> then y_4 = y_3 + Delta y_3.\n\n  So:\n    Turn3: we are at y_3=1. Then we take an action -> then at the start of turn4, we are at y_4.\n\n  Therefore, at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\n  So:\n    Turn3: y3=1 (given)\n    Turn4: y4 = y3 + Delta y3\n\n  We want to avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when k is dangerous at T.\n\nOur plan:\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves is 8 (if we go up every turn). So we would finish at turn 3+8 = 11? But wait:\n\n  Turn3: start at y=1 -> we take an action at turn3 -> then at turn4 we are at y2 = y1 + action -> so to get from 1 to 9, we need 8 moves. So:\n\n    Turn3: U -> turn4: y=2\n    Turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n    Turn5: U -> turn6: y=4\n    Turn6: U -> turn7: y=5\n    Turn7: U -> turn8: y=6\n    Turn8: U -> turn9: y=7\n    Turn9: U -> turn10: y=8\n    Turn10: U -> turn11: y=9\n\nBut at turn6: we are at y=4? Then we are on freeway4? But freeway4 is not dangerous at turn6? Only freeway1 is dangerous at turn6. And we are at y=4 (freeway4) at turn6: freeway4 is dangerous only at T=8,9. So safe.\n\nBut at turn8: we are at y=6 -> freeway6. But freeway6 is dangerous at turn8! So we crash.\n\nSimilarly, at turn9: we are at y=7 -> freeway7, which is dangerous at turn9 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot take the direct route.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 2-8 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or y=9 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nBut we start at y=1 at turn3. We need to get to y=9. \n\nWe have two critical turns: 8 and 9.\n\nWe can consider:\n\nOption 1: Reach y=9 by turn7? Then at turn8 and 9 we are at y=9 (safe). \n\nTo reach y=9 by turn7, we need to go from y=1 to y=9 in 4 moves (from turn3 to turn7: we have 4 actions: turn3,4,5,6). But 4 moves of U: 1+4=5, which is not 9. We need 8 moves? So that's impossible.\n\nWe have 4 actions: \n  turn3: U -> y=2 at turn4\n  turn4: U -> y=3 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> y=4 at turn6\n  turn6: U -> y=5 at turn7 -> not 9.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 by turn7.\n\nOption 2: Be at y=0 at turn8 and 9? But then we have to get from 0 to 9 after turn9. That would take 9 moves. And we are at turn9 at y=0, then we need 9 more moves -> total turns from turn3: 9 moves -> turn12. But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the dangerous freeways at turn8 and 9 by being at a safe freeway? But the dangerous freeways are 2 to 8. So only y=0 and y=9 are safe at turn8 and 9.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=1 at turn8? Freeway1: is it dangerous at turn8? \n  We computed freeway1: only dangerous at turn6. At turn8: freeway1 is safe? \n    Freeway1 at turn8: car1: [-47+12*(8-3)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe at turn8 and 9? \n\nSimilarly, freeway1 is safe at all turns except turn6.\n\nSo we can be at freeway1 (y=1) at turn8 and 9? \n\nBut wait: we also have to avoid freeway1 at turn6.\n\nSo the plan: \n\nWe must avoid freeway1 at turn6.\n\nWe can be at freeway1 at turn8 and 9? Yes, because it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at freeway2 at turn6? Freeway2 at turn6: \n  car: [-41+6*(6-3)= -41+18=-23, -30+18=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nBut freeway2 is dangerous at turn8 and 9. So we cannot be at freeway2 at turn8 and 9.\n\nSo safe freeways at turn8 and 9: \n  freeway1: safe (as computed)\n  freeway2: dangerous -> avoid\n  freeway3: dangerous\n  freeway4: dangerous\n  freeway5: dangerous\n  freeway6: dangerous\n  freeway7: dangerous\n  freeway8: dangerous\n  and y=0 and y=9: safe.\n\nSo at turn8 and 9, we can be at y=0, y=1, or y=9.\n\nBut we want to get to y=9 eventually.\n\nWe can design:\n\nWe need to avoid freeway1 at turn6.\n\nWe are at turn3: y=1.\n\nWe must not be at y=1 at turn6.\n\nSo at turn6, we must be at y≠1.\n\nWe can go up or down.\n\nBut we want to eventually get to 9.\n\nWe can go up as much as possible, but then we have to avoid being at freeways 2-8 at turn8 and 9.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to 0 and then wait until after turn9 to go up? But that might take longer.\n\nLet me try to simulate:\n\nWe start at turn3: y=1.\n\nWe must be not at y=1 at turn6.\n\nWe can:\n\nOption A: Go up as much as possible until we have to avoid the critical turns.\n\nBut then we get stuck at turn8 and 9 if we are in the middle.\n\nOption B: Stay at y=1 for a while? But we must leave by turn6? Actually, we must not be at y=1 at turn6. So we can be at y=1 at turn3,4,5, but not at turn6.\n\nSo we can:\n\nTurn3: S -> stay at y=1 (turn4: y=1) -> but then we are at freeway1 at turn4: safe? \n  Check freeway1 at turn4: [ -47+12*(1)= -35, -36+12= -24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nTurn4: S -> y=1 at turn5: \n  freeway1 at turn5: [-47+24=-23, -36+24=-12] -> safe.\n\nTurn5: we must leave? Because if we stay at turn5: then at turn6 we are at y=1 -> crash.\n\nSo at turn5 we must move.\n\nWe can go up or down.\n\nIf we go down: turn5: D -> then at turn6: y=0 -> safe (no freeway at y=0). Then we are at y=0 at turn6.\n\nBut then we have to go up from 0 to 9. That will take 9 moves. So from turn6 to turn14? And we also have to avoid turn8 and 9? \n\nAt turn8 and 9, we can be at y=0? which is safe. Then after turn9, we can go up.\n\nBut that would take: from turn6 at y=0: \n  turn6: at y0\n  turn7: U -> y1\n  turn8: U -> y2 -> but at turn8, freeway2 is dangerous? But we are at y2? freeway2 -> dangerous! -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y2 at turn8.\n\nWe must be at y=0,1, or 9 at turn8 and 9.\n\nSo if we go down to 0 at turn6, then:\n\n  turn6: y0 -> safe\n  turn7: U -> y1 (freeway1) at turn7: safe? \n        freeway1 at turn7: [-47+12*(4)= -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  turn8: we can stay at y1? then at turn8: freeway1 -> safe (as we computed: freeway1 at turn8: [13,24] -> safe). \n        or we can go up to y2? but that would be dangerous at turn8 (freeway2) -> so we must not go to y2 at turn8.\n\n  So at turn8: we can be at y1.\n\n  Then turn9: we can be at y1? safe? \n        freeway1 at turn9: [-47+12*6= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> safe.\n\n  But we are at y1 at turn9. Then we still need to get to y9: 8 moves.\n\n  Total turns: from turn3 to turn9: we are at y1 -> then we need 8 moves: so up to turn17. That is 15 turns? Too long.\n\nAlternatively, from y0 at turn6, we can wait at y0 until after turn9? \n\n  turn6: y0\n  turn7: S -> y0\n  turn8: S -> y0 (safe)\n  turn9: S -> y0 (safe)\n  then turn10: U -> y1\n  ... then we can go up every turn? But we have to avoid nothing? But note: freeway1 is safe after turn6? \n        at turn10: freeway1: [-47+12*(7)= -47+84=37, -36+84=48] -> safe.\n\n  But then we go:\n      turn10: y1\n      turn11: y2 -> freeway2 at turn11: \n            freeway2 car: [-41+6*(11-3)= -41+48=7, -30+48=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n      ... until turn18: y9.\n\n  Total turns: from turn3 to turn18? 16 turns? Not minimal.\n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nWe can try to get to y=9 by turn7? Impossible because we need 8 moves.\n\nWe can try to get to a safe haven at turn8 and 9: either y=0, y=1, or y=9.\n\nWe are at turn3: y=1.\n\nWe have turns 3,4,5,6,7 to get to one of these safe positions at turn8.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe can try to get to y=9 by turn10? Then we avoid the dangerous turns 8 and 9 by being at y=9? \n\nBut we can be at y=9 at turn8: then we are safe at turn8 and 9.\n\nHow to get to y=9 by turn8? \n\n  We start at turn3: y=1.\n  We have 5 actions: turn3,4,5,6,7 -> to go from 1 to 9: we need 8 moves, but we only have 5 actions -> so we can only go up 5 times: 1+5=6 -> so at turn8 we are at y=6.\n\n  Then we are at freeway6 at turn8 -> dangerous.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to y=1 at turn8? \n\n  We are already at y=1 at turn3. We can stay until turn8? But we must avoid turn6 at y=1.\n\n  So we can:\n      turn3: S -> y1 at turn4\n      turn4: S -> y1 at turn5\n      turn5: we must leave y1 (to avoid turn6 at y1) -> so we can go down to y0 at turn6? \n      turn5: D -> then at turn6: y0 -> safe (and avoids freeway1 at turn6)\n      turn6: we are at y0. Then we can go back up?\n          turn6: U -> y1 at turn7\n          turn7: S -> y1 at turn8 -> safe (freeway1 at turn8 is safe)\n\n      Then at turn8: we are at y1.\n\n      Then we need to get to y9: from y1 to y9: 8 moves.\n\n      So: turn8: y1\n          turn9: U -> y2 -> but at turn9, freeway2 is dangerous? -> crash.\n\n      So we cannot do that.\n\n  Instead, at turn7: we can stay at y1? Then turn8: y1 (safe). Then at turn9: we must not go to y2? We can stay at y1? \n          turn9: S -> y1 (safe) -> then we are safe at turn9.\n\n      Then from turn9: we start going up: \n          turn9: y1\n          turn10: U -> y2\n          turn11: U -> y3\n          ... until turn17: y9.\n\n      Total turns: from turn3 to turn17: 15 turns? Not minimal.\n\nBut we can try to use the fact that at turn8 and 9 we can be at y=1, so we stay there, and then after turn9, the freeways 2-8 become safe again? \n\n  After turn9: \n      freeway2: at turn10: [-41+6*7= -41+42=1, -30+42=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe? \n      But wait: the condition: we are at freeway k at turn T and 0 in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n      At turn10: freeway2: [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n      Similarly, freeway3 to 8: same car structure? Actually, freeway2,3,4,5,6 have the same car: so at turn10: safe.\n\n      freeway7 and 8: car1: at turn10: [-41+6*7=1, -30+42=12] -> safe.\n                 car2: at turn10: [-5+6*7=37, 6+42=48] -> safe.\n\n      So after turn9, all freeways are safe? \n\n  Therefore, we can start moving up after turn9.\n\n  So the plan:\n\n      turn3: S -> y1 at turn4\n      turn4: S -> y1 at turn5\n      turn5: D -> y0 at turn6   (to avoid y1 at turn6)\n      turn6: U -> y1 at turn7\n      turn7: S -> y1 at turn8   (safe at turn8: freeway1 safe)\n      turn8: S -> y1 at turn9   (safe at turn9: freeway1 safe)\n      turn9: U -> y2 at turn10  (freeway2 at turn10: safe as computed)\n      turn10: U -> y3\n      turn11: U -> y4\n      turn12: U -> y5\n      turn13: U -> y6\n      turn14: U -> y7\n      turn15: U -> y8\n      turn16: U -> y9\n\n  So we reach y9 at turn16.\n\n  Total turns from turn3: 13 moves? \n      Actions: turn3 to turn16: 14 actions? \n          We start at turn3 (state at turn3) and take actions at turn3,4,...,15? Then at turn16 we are at y9.\n\n      How many actions? from turn3 to turn15: 13 actions, and then at turn16 we have the state.\n\n      But the goal: we require that at the last turn (turn3+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\n      We have H = number of actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions.\n\n      After H actions, we are at turn3+H.\n\n      We start at turn3: we take action at turn3, then state at turn4.\n      After H actions, state at turn3+H.\n\n      We want at turn3+H-1 to be at y=9? \n\n      The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n      So if we take an action at turn3+H-1, then the next state (at turn3+H) should be at y=9? \n\n      But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      So the state at the turn when we take the last action is y=9.\n\n      Actually, the player update: \n          y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t\n\n      So the state y_t is after the action at t-1? \n\n      We start at turn3: we are given y3=1.\n\n      Then we take action a3 at turn3 -> then y4 = y3 + a3.\n\n      Then at the end of the sequence: we take an action at turn3+H-1, and then we have y_{3+H} = ... \n\n      But we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n      Here t1=3, so we want y_{3+H-1}=9.\n\n      How do we achieve that? \n\n        We start at y3=1.\n\n        We take actions: a3, a4, ..., a_{3+H-2} to get to y_{3+H-1}=9.\n\n        The last action is at turn3+H-2? \n\n      But the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t=0 to H-1: \n          t=0: a_{t1} = a3\n          t=1: a4\n          ...\n          t=H-1: a_{3+H-1}\n\n      And then after the last action, we are at state at turn3+H.\n\n      But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? or after the action of turn t1+H-1?\n\n      Actually, the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the action of turn t1+H-2? \n\n      Let me clarify:\n\n          Turn t1 (3): we start with y3=1.\n          Then we take a3 -> then we have state at turn4: y4 = y3 + a3.\n\n          So the state at turn T is determined by the action at turn T-1.\n\n          We want the state at turn T = t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\n          How to achieve state y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n          This is the state after the action taken at turn (t1+H-1-1) = t1+H-2.\n\n          But the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      The problem says: a sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1: \n          actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n      And then we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\n      But at turn t1+H-1, we are about to take an action? Or have we already taken an action?\n\n      The problem states: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n      So at the start of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\n      Then we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\n      Therefore, at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      And then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1}? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, so we don't care what happens after the action? \n\n      Actually, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at that state at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n      How did we get there? By the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n      So the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? \n\n      But the sequence includes actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1: that's H actions.\n\n      This implies that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we move to a new state at turn t1+H, but we don't care as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n      However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", so we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, meaning we have not taken the action of turn t1+H-1 yet.\n\n      But then why do we have an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n      This suggests that we take H actions, and at the turn immediately after the last action (turn t1+H) we might be at a new state, but we require that at turn t1+H-1, before taking the last action, we are at (0,9).\n\n      So the last action (at turn t1+H-1) might be arbitrary? But the goal is achieved at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n      However, the player update: \n          y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t.\n\n      To have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, this is determined by the actions taken at turns before t1+H-1.\n\n      Specifically, we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-2, and then at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      The action at turn t1+H-1 is then taken, but it doesn't affect the state at turn t1+H-1.\n\n      However, the collision avoidance: we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n      Because at turn t (from t1 to t1+H-1), we are at y_t, and we must not collide with cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\n      So at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is safe (no freeway). But we also must check that at turn t1+H-1, we are safe.\n\n      And we are safe at y=9.\n\n      So the action at turn t1+H-1 can be anything, but we have to specify it. And it doesn't cause a collision.\n\n      So in the plan above, we reached y=9 at turn16? That would be t1+H-1 = 16 -> so 3+H-1=16 -> H=14.\n\n      But in the plan I described earlier, we would be at y=9 at turn16? \n\n        turn3: y3=1\n        turn4: y4=1 (after S at turn3)\n        turn5: y5=1 (after S at turn4)\n        turn6: y6=0 (after D at turn5)\n        turn7: y7=1 (after U at turn6)\n        turn8: y8=1 (after S at turn7)\n        turn9: y9=1 (after S at turn8)\n        turn10: y10=2 (after U at turn9)\n        turn11: y11=3\n        turn12: y12=4\n        turn13: y13=5\n        turn14: y14=6\n        turn15: y15=7\n        turn16: y16=8 -> not 9.\n\n      I see, we need one more.\n\n      turn16: U -> y17=9.\n\n      So we are at y=9 at turn17.\n\n      So t1+H-1=17 -> 3+H-1=17 -> H=15.\n\n      Actions: turn3 to turn17: 15 actions? \n          turns: 3,4,...,17 -> 15 actions.\n\n      But we want to minimize H.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nWe can try to get to y=1 at turn8 and then on turn8 and turn9 move up twice? But then at turn9 we would be at y=3, which is freeway3 -> dangerous at turn9.\n\nAlternatively, we can on turn9 move up to y=2? but freeway2 is dangerous at turn9.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway2-8 at turn8 and 9.\n\nTherefore, the only safe positions at turn8 and 9 are y=0, y=1, and y=9.\n\nWe cannot be at y=9 at turn8 or 9 because we don't have enough time.\n\nSo we have to be at y=0 or y=1 at turn8 and 9.\n\nThen after turn9, we move up.\n\nBut can we be at y=1 at turn8 and then at turn9 move to y=0? But then at turn9 we are at y=0 (safe) and then we have to move up from 0 to 9 -> 9 moves.\n\nOr at turn9 we move to y=2? -> dangerous.\n\nSo we are stuck at y=0 or y=1 for turns 8 and 9.\n\nThe fastest: be at y=1 at turn8 and turn9, then starting from turn10, move up every turn.\n\nFrom turn10 to turn17: 8 moves to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn17.\n\nBut how to get to y=1 at turn8 and turn9, while avoiding freeway1 at turn6.\n\nWe are at y=1 at turn3,4,5. Then at turn5 we move down to avoid turn6 at y=1.\n\nThen at turn6 we are at y0.\n\nThen at turn6 we move up to y1 at turn7.\n\nThen at turn7 and turn8 we can stay at y1? \n\n  turn7: y1 -> freeway1 at turn7: [ -47+12*(7-3)= -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> does this include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  turn8: y1 -> freeway1 at turn8: [ -47+12*5= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe.\n\nThen turn8: we can stay at y1? -> turn9: y1 (safe).\n\nThen turn9: we are at y1. Then we start moving up:\n\n  turn9: U -> y2 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> y3 at turn11\n  ...\n  turn16: U -> y9 at turn17.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\n  turn3: S (y3=1 -> then at turn4: y4=1)\n  turn4: S (y5=1)\n  turn5: D (y6=0)   [avoids freeway1 at turn6]\n  turn6: U (y7=1)\n  turn7: S (y8=1)\n  turn8: S (y9=1)\n  turn9: U (y10=2)\n  turn10: U (y11=3)\n  turn11: U (y12=4)\n  turn12: U (y13=5)\n  turn13: U (y14=6)\n  turn14: U (y15=7)\n  turn15: U (y16=8)\n  turn16: U (y17=9)\n\nBut then at turn17, we are at y=9. So we want at turn t1+H-1 = 3+H-1 = 17 to be at y=9.\n\nSo H-1 = 14 -> H=15.\n\nThe actions are from turn3 to turn3+14 = turn17? \n  The sequence: t=0 to 14 (15 actions): \n      t=0: turn3\n      t=1: turn4\n      ...\n      t=14: turn17\n\nBut the last action is at turn17, and we are at y17=9 at the start of turn17? \n\n  No: \n      At the start of turn16: y16=8.\n      We take action U at turn16 -> then y17 = 8+1 =9.\n\n      Then at the start of turn17: we are at y=9.\n\n      So we require turn t1+H-1 = 3+15-1 = 17 -> and at the start of turn17, we are at y=9.\n\n      And the last action is at turn16 (which is the 14th action in the sequence, index t=14).\n\n      The action at turn17 is not taken? But the sequence has 15 actions, including an action at turn17.\n\n  But we only need to be at y=9 at the start of turn17, so the action at turn17 is not necessary? \n\n  The problem says: minimize H, the number of turns in the sequence. And the sequence has H actions.\n\n  But if we include the action at turn17, then we have to specify it, and then we move to y18. But we don't care about y18.\n\n  However, the goal is achieved at turn17, so the action at turn17 can be anything (and it doesn't cause a collision because at turn17 we are at y=9, and then after the action we move to y18, but we are not required to be safe at turn18? \n\n  But the collision avoidance is for every turn from t1 to the turn when we reach the goal? \n\n  The problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars ... during the sequence\".\n\n  And we are required to avoid collisions at every turn T in which we are at a freeway.\n\n  Specifically, for each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, we are at y_T, and we must not collide.\n\n  At turn17: we are at y17=9 -> safe. Then we take an action at turn17: say 'S', then we move to y18=9, which is safe. But we don't care about turn18.\n\n  However, the requirement is only up to the turn when we reach the goal? The goal is reached at turn17, so turn17 is the last turn we care about.\n\n  But the collision condition is for every turn T in the path, including turn17.\n\n  At turn17: we are at y=9, safe.\n\n  So we can include the action at turn17. But we don't need to move anymore.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      turn17: S -> then y18=9.\n\n  But then we are at y=9 at turn17? \n        At the start of turn17: y17=9.\n        We take action S -> then at turn18: y18=9.\n\n  But the state at turn17 is already 9, so we have reached the goal at turn17.\n\n  The action at turn17 is not necessary for reaching the goal, but the sequence requires H actions, and we are at the goal at turn17, which is after H-1 turns from turn3? \n\n  We want: turn3+H-1 = 17 -> H=15.\n\n  So we must take 15 actions: turn3 to turn17.\n\n  The last action (turn17) can be 'S'. \n\n  In the sequence above, we have actions for turn3 to turn16: that's 14 actions. We need one more for turn17.\n\n  So add turn17: S.\n\n  But then the state at turn17 is already 9 (before the action), and after the action we are still at 9.\n\n  So the full sequence:\n\n      turn3: S\n      turn4: S\n      turn5: D\n      turn6: U\n      turn7: S\n      turn8: S\n      turn9: U\n      turn10: U\n      turn11: U\n      turn12: U\n      turn13: U\n      turn14: U\n      turn15: U\n      turn16: U\n      turn17: S   (or anything, but S is safe)\n\n  Now, we must check collisions at every turn from 3 to 17.\n\n  Let's make a table:\n\n  Turn | y at start of turn | action | then y at next turn | freeway at this turn | cars on that freeway at this turn | 0 in span?

But we are at freeway2? \n        freeway2 at turn6: safe.\n        But we also have to avoid being at freeway2 at turn8? \n        We can then at turn6: D (y7=1) -> then freeway1 at turn7: \n              freeway1 at turn7: [ -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n        turn7: S (y8=1) -> safe at turn8.\n        turn8: S (y9=1) -> safe.\n        then from turn9: start going up.\n\n        This is the same as the first plan but we are one step ahead? \n          In the first plan, at turn5 we were at y=1, then down to y0 at turn6.\n          Here, at turn5 we are at y=2, then down to y1 at turn7.\n\n        Let's count:\n\n          turn3: U -> y4=2\n          turn4: U -> y5=3\n          turn5: D -> y6=2\n          turn6: D -> y7=1\n          turn7: S -> y8=1\n          turn8: S -> y9=1\n          turn9: U -> y10=2\n          ... until turn16: y17=9\n\n        So we are at y=9 at turn17? and then an action at turn17: S.\n\n        Total actions: 15.\n\n        But we have the same number of actions.\n\n        However, we are at a higher freeway earlier? \n\n        Let's compare with the first plan:\n\n          First plan: \n            turn3: S (y4=1)\n            turn4: S (y5=1)\n            turn5: D (y6=0)\n            turn6: U (y7=1)\n            turn7: S (y8=1)\n            turn8: S (y9=1)\n            turn9: U (y10=2) ... to turn16: U (y17=9), turn17: S.\n\n          This plan:\n            turn3: U (y4=2)\n            turn4: U (y5=3)\n            turn5: D (y6=2)\n            turn6: D (y7=1)\n            turn7: S (y8=1)\n            turn8: S (y9=1)\n            turn9: U (y10=2)\n            ... then the same.\n\n        So it also takes 15 actions.\n\n        But note: in this plan, at turn6 we are at freeway2: which is safe at turn6, but then we move down to freeway1 at turn7.\n\n        Is there a way to get to y=9 by turn16 without the extra action at the end? \n\n        We want to be at y=9 at turn16 (which is 3+H-1=16 -> H=14).\n\n        How? \n\n          We have 14 actions: from turn3 to turn16.\n\n          The state at the start of turn16 is y16, and we want y16=9.\n\n          We start at y3=1.\n\n          We need to make 8 net up moves.\n\n          But we also have to be at safe positions at turn8 and 9.\n\n          How to squeeze the moves? \n\n          We can be at a safe haven at turn8 and 9 (y=1), and then from turn9 to turn16 we have 7 actions.\n\n          We need to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 moves. So we need 8 actions, but we only have 7.\n\n          Therefore, it's impossible to reach by turn16.\n\n        So the minimal H is 15.\n\n        But let me confirm with the first plan: we reach y=9 at turn17, so H=15.\n\n        So both plans take 15 actions.\n\n        Now, is there a plan that uses only 14 actions? Probably not, because from turn3 to turn16 is 14 actions, and we need 8 moves up, but we also have to spend some moves to avoid.\n\n        We have to make at least 8 up moves. And we have to avoid freeway1 at turn6 and freeways2-8 at turn8 and 9.\n\n        The detour costs at least 3 moves: \n          In the first plan: we did 2 S and 1 D in the first three moves, then a U, then later 2 S, and then the 8 U's -> total moves: 2S, 1D, 1U, 2S, 8U -> 1D and 12U? but we only need 8 net U's? \n          Actually, the net displacement: 8 up.\n          Moves: \n             S:0, S:0, D:-1, U:+1, S:0, S:0, then 8U: +8 -> total +8.\n          But we did 12U and 1D? No: we did 8U and 1D and 4S.\n\n          In the first plan: actions: S,S,D,U,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,S -> that's 8U, 1D, 5S -> net: 8-1=7 -> but we went from 1 to 9: 8 up.\n\n          Wait, let's calculate:\n\n            start at y3=1.\n            turn3: S -> y4=1\n            turn4: S -> y5=1\n            turn5: D -> y6=0\n            turn6: U -> y7=1\n            turn7: S -> y8=1\n            turn8: S -> y9=1\n            turn9: U -> y10=2\n            turn10: U -> y11=3\n            turn11: U -> y12=4\n            turn12: U -> y13=5\n            turn13: U -> y14=6\n            turn14: U -> y15=7\n            turn15: U -> y16=8\n            turn16: U -> y17=9\n\n          Then turn17: S -> y18=9.\n\n          We have 8U and 1D and 6S? \n\n          The net: +8 (from U) -1 (from D) = +7, and we started at 1 -> 1+7=8, but we need 9? \n\n          I see: we start at 1 at turn3, and we want to be at 9 at turn17? the difference is 8, so net +8.\n\n          But the moves: \n            D: -1\n            U: 8 times: +8\n            S: 6 times: 0\n          net: +7 -> we end at 1+7=8, not 9.\n\n          What's the issue? \n\n          The down move: from 1 to 0: that's -1.\n          Then up from 0 to 1: +1 -> that cancels the down? \n          Then from 1 we go up 8 times: to 9.\n\n          So we need 8 up moves after we are back to 1.\n\n          In the sequence above, after turn8 we are at 1. Then we did 8 up moves: \n                turn9: U ->2\n                turn10:U->3\n                turn11:U->4\n                turn12:U->5\n                turn13:U->6\n                turn14:U->7\n                turn15:U->8\n                turn16:U->9\n\n          Then at turn16 we are at y16=9? \n          But then we have to specify an action at turn16? and then we are at turn17: y17=9 or 10? \n\n          Actually, at the start of turn16: we are at y16=9? or we are at 8?\n\n          Let me trace:\n\n            turn8: y8=1 (at start of turn8)\n            action at turn8: S -> then y9 = 1 (start of turn9)\n            turn9: action U -> y10=2\n            turn10: U -> y11=3\n            turn11: U -> y12=4\n            turn12: U -> y13=5\n            turn13: U -> y14=6\n            turn14: U -> y15=7\n            turn15: U -> y16=8\n            turn16: U -> y17=9\n\n          So at the start of turn16: y16=8.\n          We take U at turn16 -> then at turn17: y17=9.\n\n          We require to be at y=9 at turn17, which is the start of turn17.\n\n          So the last action is at turn16.\n\n          But then we have to include an action for turn17? \n\n          The sequence has H actions: from turn3 to turn3+H-1.\n\n          We want to be at (0,9) at turn3+H-1.\n\n          Here, turn3+H-1 = 17 -> H-1=14 -> H=15.\n\n          So we need 15 actions, including an action at turn17.\n\n          Therefore, we need to have an action at turn17.\n\n          But we are already at y=9 at the start of turn17, so we can do 'S' at turn17.\n\n          And then at turn18: y18=9.\n\n          But the goal is achieved at turn17.\n\n          So the plan is:\n\n            turn3: S\n            turn4: S\n            turn5: D\n            turn6: U\n            turn7: S\n            turn8: S\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: S\n\n          Now, net moves: \n            D: 1 (at turn5) -> -1\n            U: 8 (at turns6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16) -> 9? \n                turn6: U -> from y6=0 to y7=1: that's one U.\n                then turns9 to 16: that's 8 U's? \n                turns: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 8 U's.\n                total U: 1 (turn6) + 8 = 9 U's.\n            S: 5 (turns3,4,7,8,17)\n\n          Net: 9U - 1D = 8 net up.\n\n          Start at 1: 1+8=9.\n\n          So at the start of turn17: y17=9.\n\n          Then we do S at turn17: y18=9.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But why did I say turn16: U -> y17=9? \n                At turn16: start at y16=8, then U -> y17=9.\n          Then at turn17: start at y17=9, then S -> y18=9.\n\n          So we are at 9 at turn17.\n\n          Total actions: 15.\n\nSo the minimal H is 15.\n\nBut can we do with 14?\n\nSuppose we are at y=9 at turn16.\n\nThen we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn16.\n\nHow to get from y3=1 to y16=9 in 13 actions? net 8 up moves.\n\nBut we have to avoid turn6 at y=1 and turn8,9 at freeways2-8.\n\nAnd we have to make 8 net up moves.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is turn11: \n      turn3: U (2)\n      turn4: U (3)\n      turn5: U (4)\n      turn6: U (5)  [but at turn6, we must avoid y=1: we are at 5, safe]\n      turn7: U (6)\n      turn8: we cannot be at 6 -> dangerous.\n      So we have to avoid turn8 at freeways2-8.\n\n      How?

Then at turn7 we can move down? \n            turn7: D (5) -> then at turn8:5 -> dangerous.\n\n      Or move down more: \n            turn7: D (5) \n            turn8: D (4) -> dangerous.\n\n      We cannot get to y=0,1, or 9 by turn8 from 6 in one move? \n\n      So we have to be at a safe haven at turn8.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot be at 6 at turn7 if we want to be at 0,1, or9 at turn8.\n\n      We must arrange to be at 0,1, or 9 at turn8.\n\n      If we want to be at 9 at turn8, then we need 8 moves from turn3 to turn7: \n            turn3 to turn7: 5 actions -> 5 moves -> max to 1+5=6 -> not 9.\n\n      If we want to be at 1 at turn8, then we can try to move down from higher, but then we waste moves.\n\n      For example, to be at 1 at turn8: \n            turn7: we must be at 0,1, or2.\n            Suppose we are at 6 at turn6, then:\n                  turn6: at 6\n                  turn6: action: D (5) at turn7\n                  turn7: action: to get to 0,1, or2: we need to move down 3 to 5 more? not possible in one action.\n\n      So it is not possible to be at a safe haven at turn8 if we are at 6 at turn6.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot use the direct up method.\n\n      Hence, the minimal H is 15.\n\n      We'll go with the first plan.\n\n      But there is a symmetric plan: go up initially to save time, then down to freeway1 by turn7.\n\n      We already did that and it also took 15 actions.\n\n      So either is fine.\n\n      I'll choose the first plan that I described in detail.\n\n      Sequence:\n\n        Turn 3: S\n        Turn 4: S\n        Turn 5: D\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: S\n        Turn 8: S\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n        Turn 13: U\n        Turn 14: U\n        Turn 15: U\n        Turn 16: U\n        Turn 17: S\n\n      But wait, the last action at turn17: we are at y=9 and we do S, which is safe.\n\n      However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=15.\n\n      But is there a plan with H=14? We think not.\n\n      We'll output the plan.\n\n      Note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but we have to output the sequence.\n\n      In the answer format:\n\n        Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n        Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n        ...\n\n      Here t_1=3.\n\n      So:\n\n        Turn 3: S\n        Turn 4: S\n        Turn 5: D\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: S\n        Turn 8: S\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n        Turn 13: U\n        Turn 14: U\n        Turn 15: U\n        Turn 16: U\n        Turn 17: S\n\n      But wait: the actions are for turns 3 to 17, which is 15 actions.\n\n      And we are at y=9 at turn17 (the start of turn17).\n\n      And then we take action S at turn17, which is safe.\n\n      This meets the goal.\n\n      However, note that we could avoid the last S if we are allowed to have H=14 and be at y=9 at turn16? But we argued that is not possible.\n\n      Alternatively, we could end at turn16? \n\n        We want to be at y=9 at turn16 (which is 3+14-1=16).\n\n        Then the sequence would be 14 actions: turn3 to turn16.\n\n        How? \n\n          We need to get from y3=1 to y16=9 in 14-1 = 13 state transitions? \n          Actually, 14 actions: \n            action at turn3: to turn4\n            ... \n            action at turn16: to turn17.\n\n          But we require that at turn16 (the start of turn16) we are at y16=9.\n\n          So we need to reach y16=9 by the action at turn15.\n\n          So the action at turn15 should move us to 9 at turn16.\n\n          We start at y3=1.\n\n          We need net +8.\n\n          With 14 actions: we have 14 moves.\n\n          But we have to waste some moves to avoid.\n\n          Let me try:\n\n          We can be at y=1 at turn8 and turn9, and then from turn9 to turn16: 7 actions -> we need 8 up moves -> not possible.\n\n          Or we can try to be at a higher freeway earlier and then drop to y=1 at turn8 and 9, and then go up.\n\n          For example:\n\n            turn3: U (2)\n            turn4: U (3)\n            turn5: U (4)\n            turn6: D (3)   [avoid freeway1 at turn6: we are at 3, safe]\n            turn7: D (2)\n            turn8: D (1)  [now at turn8: y8=1, safe]\n            turn9: S (1)  [safe]\n            then from turn9 to turn16: 7 actions to go from 1 to 9: need 8 moves -> not enough.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn3: U (2)\n            turn4: U (3)\n            turn5: U (4)\n            turn6: U (5)   [safe at freeway5 at turn6]\n            turn7: D (4)   [at turn7: freeway4 -> safe? \n                   freeway4 at turn7: [-41+6*4= -41+24=-17, -30+24=-6] -> safe]\n            turn8: we must be at safe haven: so we move down to 3? \n                   turn7: D (4->3) at turn8: freeway3 at turn8: dangerous! -> crash.\n\n          So not possible.\n\n          Therefore, we must use 15 actions.\n\n      Final answer.\n\n      We'll output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 15.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The player's y-coordinate changes by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and must stay within [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T. So at turn T, we check the freeway y_T for collision. When we move, we are not on the next freeway until the next turn.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nGiven car state at turn t1=4:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> since direction is right, the car moves right. The span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? But note the representation: the table says (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is leftmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: from [tau, h] at t1 becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at t1=4, the car is at [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? But the input is given as (head, tail) = (-24, -35). \n\nLet me clarify: the input says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (so the larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). Therefore, the span is [tail, head] = [tau, h] = [-35, -24]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (leftmost, so smaller x) and tail is the rear (larger x), and the span would be [h, tau] but then the update moves left. However, note that in the update rule for left-moving: span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut all cars in this state are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> so head=-24, tail=-35, so span at t1=4: [-35, -24] (because tail=-35, head=-24). Since it's right-moving, at turn T, the span becomes: [ -35 + 12*(T-4), -24 + 12*(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have three cars each.\n\nOur goal: start at y=1 at turn 4. We must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T if at that turn T, the car on freeway y has a span that covers x=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=1 to y=9. We start at y=1 at turn 4. We can only change by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 8 moves (if we go up every turn). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nPlan: we will simulate the moves and check for collisions at each turn on the freeway we are on.\n\nWe are at turn 4: at y=1.\n\nWe are going to consider a sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's compute the positions of the cars at various turns.\n\nNote: the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway y such that 0 is in the span of that car.\n\nWe are only on one freeway per turn.\n\nWe start at turn 4 at y=1. Then we choose an action for turn 4, which will determine y at turn 5.\n\nBut note: at turn 4, we are at y=1. We must check for collision at turn 4 on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 5, we will be at y_5 (which is 1, 0, or 2, depending on the action at turn 4) and we check freeway y_5 at turn 5.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo let's check freeway 1 at turn 4:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: at t1=4, span = [-35, -24] (since right-moving: [tau, head] = [-35, -24]). \n\nAt turn 4: is 0 in [-35, -24]? No, because -35 <= 0 <= -24 is false.\n\nSo at turn 4, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nNow, we can choose an action at turn 4: U, D, or S.\n\nBut we are at y=1. If we go down, we go to y=0. Note that y=0 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so at turn 5 we would be at y=0 and we don't check any freeway? But the collision rule says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span for any car on freeway y_T\". And y_T is the freeway we are on. But if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are not on a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So no collision at y=0 or y=9.\n\nTherefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9. So we can use y=0 as a safe spot.\n\nSimilarly, we start at y=1 at turn 4, and we want to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal moves: if we can go straight up without stopping, that would be 8 moves: U repeated 8 times, so we would be at y=9 at turn 12 (turn4: y1, then turn5: y2, turn6: y3, ... turn12: y9). But we must avoid collisions at each freeway we step on.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway y (from 2 to 8) at the turn when we are on that freeway.\n\nBut note: we start at turn4 at y1, then at turn5 we are at y2 (if we go up at turn4), then turn6 at y3, etc.\n\nSo we will be on freeway 2 at turn5, freeway3 at turn6, ... freeway8 at turn11, and then at turn12 we are at y9 (safe).\n\nBut we must check:\n\nAt turn4: y1 -> freeway1: we already checked: at turn4, car on freeway1: [-35, -24] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nAt turn5: we are at y2. Check freeway2 at turn5.\n\nFreeway2: one car: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> so at t1=4, span = [-35, -24] (tail=-35, head=-24). \nAt turn5 (T=5, so T-t1=1): [ -35 + 6*1, -24 + 6*1 ] = [-29, -18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn6: y3. Freeway3: one car: same as freeway2? (-24,-35,right,6) -> at turn6 (T=6, T-t1=2): [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nAt turn7: y4. Freeway4: same car -> at turn7 (T=7, T-t1=3): [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in there? -17<=0<=-6 -> no, because 0 is greater than -6? Actually, -6 is the head, so the segment is [-17, -6] and 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nAt turn8: y5. Freeway5: same car -> at turn8 (T=8, T-t1=4): [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]. Now, 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because the segment includes 0 (at the head). So collision at turn8 on freeway5.\n\nTherefore, if we go straight up, at turn8 when we are at y5, we collide with the car on freeway5.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up.\n\nWe must avoid freeway5 at turn8.\n\nWe have two options: either delay our arrival at freeway5 until the car has passed, or use a detour (like going down to y0 and then up).\n\nBut note that we can also stay at a freeway for multiple turns? However, we want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y4 and then wait (stay) for one turn, and then continue up.\n\nLet me try:\n\nWe are at:\nturn4: y1 -> safe (as above)\nturn5: y2 -> safe\nturn6: y3 -> safe\nturn7: y4 -> safe (as above: at turn7, freeway4: [-17,-6] -> safe)\n\nNow, at turn7 we are at y4. If we go up at turn7, then at turn8 we are at y5 -> which we saw is unsafe (because at turn8, freeway5: [-11,0] -> collision).\n\nSo instead, at turn7 we can stay at y4? Then at turn8 we are still at y4.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn8: \nFreeway4: car: at T=8 (t1=4, so delta=4): [-35+6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. \nBut wait, freeway4 has the same car as freeway5? Actually, no: each freeway has its own car. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway1: one car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> but wait, the car on freeway1 is different: it has speed 12, while freeways 2-6 have speed 6? \n\nThe table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n|-----------|------|\n| 1 | (-24, -35, right, 12) |\n| 2 | (-24, -35, right, 6) |\n| 3 | (-24, -35, right, 6) |\n| 4 | (-24, -35, right, 6) |\n| 5 | (-24, -35, right, 6) |\n| 6 | (-24, -35, right, 6) |\n| 7 | (-24, -35, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) |\n| 8 | (-24, -35, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) |\n\nSo freeway1: one car with speed 12.\nfreeway2 to 6: each has one car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> same car? But they are on different freeways, so independent.\n\nfreeway7 and 8: each has three cars.\n\nSo for freeway4: the car is (-24,-35,right,6). At turn8 (T=8, delta=4): [ -35+6*4, -24+6*4 ] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. So 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision? \n\nBut wait: at turn8, if we are at freeway4, then we check the car on freeway4. So at turn8, freeway4 has a car that covers 0? Yes. So if we are at freeway4 at turn8, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at turn8: same calculation? Actually, freeway5 has the same car? Yes, same parameters. So freeway5 at turn8: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nBut we are considering staying at freeway4 at turn8: that would be unsafe.\n\nSo if we stay at y4 at turn7, then at turn8 we are still at y4 -> and freeway4 has a car that covers 0 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y4 at turn8.\n\nWhat if we go down? At turn7 we are at y4. Instead of going up, we go down to y3 at turn8.\n\nThen at turn8 we are at y3. Check freeway3 at turn8: \nFreeway3: car (-24,-35,right,6): at T=8: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Actually, the segment is from -11 to 0, so yes, 0 is the head? So it includes 0. So collision.\n\nSo going down to y3 at turn8 is also unsafe.\n\nWhat about going down to y5? We are at y4 at turn7. If we go up, we go to y5 at turn8 -> which we know is unsafe (freeway5 at turn8: [-11,0]).\n\nSo at turn8, no matter if we are at y3, y4, or y5, we are unsafe? \n\nBut wait: freeway3,4,5 all have the same car? And at turn8, they are all at [-11,0]? \n\nYes, because each freeway from 2 to 6 has a car starting at the same initial position and moving at the same speed. So at turn8, every freeway from 2 to 6 has a car at [-11,0]. Therefore, if we are on any of these freeways (y2 to y6) at turn8, we collide.\n\nBut we are at turn7 at y4. We cannot stay, cannot go up to y5, cannot go down to y3? Then we must go to y0? But we are at y4, so we can go down to y3, then to y2, then to y1, then to y0? That would take 4 turns and then we are safe at y0? But that would be too long.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn8.\n\nBut note: at turn8, freeways 2-6 are all unsafe. So we must be either at y0, y1, y7, y8, or y9 at turn8? But we are at y4 at turn7. We cannot jump to y7 in one move.\n\nSo the only safe place at turn8 is y0, y1, or maybe above? But we are at y4, so we can go down to y0 in 4 moves? But that would be:\n\nturn7: at y4 -> action D: to y3 at turn8 -> but we just saw that at turn8, y3 is unsafe (freeway3 has the car at [-11,0]). Similarly, if we go D again at turn7 to y3 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nWe need to get to a safe row by turn8.\n\nBut note: we are at turn7. We have one move to make at turn7. We can go down to y3, but that is unsafe at turn8. We can go up to y5, but that is unsafe. We can stay at y4 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn8? But we are at y4 at turn7, and we cannot get to y0 or y7 in one move.\n\nWait, what about freeway1? At turn8: \nFreeway1: car with speed 12. At turn8 (T=8, delta=4): [ -35 + 12*4, -24 + 12*4 ] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: let's check.\n\nBut we are at y4 at turn7. We can only move to y3, y4, or y5. We cannot get to y1 in one move.\n\nSo at turn8, we must be at y3, y4, or y5 -> which are all unsafe.\n\nThis seems impossible? But wait, we started at turn4. We have more time? We can adjust earlier.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn8.\n\nSo we need to either be below freeway2 (i.e., y0 or y1) or above freeway6 (y7, y8, y9) at turn8.\n\nBut we are at y1 at turn4. We have 4 turns (turn4,5,6,7) to get to a safe row by turn8.\n\nWe can go up as fast as possible to get above y6? But to get to y7 we need 6 moves: from y1 to y7: 6 moves. We have 4 moves: turn4,5,6,7 -> 4 moves. We can get to y1+4 = y5? But then we are at y5 at turn8? which is unsafe.\n\nWe can go down to y0 and stay there until turn8? \n\nLet me plan:\n\nAt turn4: we are at y1. We can go down to y0 at turn5? Then we are at y0 at turn5,6,7,8? That would be safe because y0 is not a freeway.\n\nBut then at turn9 we can start going up.\n\nBut that would take: \nturn4: D -> to y0 at turn5.\nThen we can stay at y0 until we want to move up. But we need to get to y9.\n\nFrom y0 at turn5, we can start going up at turn5? But we are at y0 at turn5. Then:\n\nturn5: at y0 -> action U: to y1 at turn6.\nturn6: at y1 -> action U: to y2 at turn7.\nturn7: at y2 -> action U: to y3 at turn8.\n\nBut at turn8, we are at y3 -> which is unsafe (freeway3 at turn8: [-11,0]).\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn8.\n\nSo at turn8, we must be at y0, y1, y7, y8, or y9.\n\nBut we are at y1 at turn4. We have 4 moves to get to one of these safe rows.\n\nTo get to y7: we need 6 moves (from y1 to y7: 6 steps up). We have only 4 moves (turn4 to turn7) so we can only get to y1+4 = y5 -> not enough.\n\nTo get to y0: we can do that in 1 move: at turn4: D -> then at turn5 we are at y0. Then we can stay at y0 until turn8? Then at turn8 we are at y0 (safe).\n\nThen at turn8, we are at y0. Then we can start going up.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions on the freeways as we go up.\n\nWe are at turn8 at y0.\n\nThen:\nturn8: U -> to y1 at turn9.\nturn9: U -> to y2 at turn10.\nturn10: U -> to y3 at turn11.\nturn11: U -> to y4 at turn12.\nturn12: U -> to y5 at turn13.\nturn13: U -> to y6 at turn14.\nturn14: U -> to y7 at turn15.\nturn15: U -> to y8 at turn16.\nturn16: U -> to y9 at turn17.\n\nBut we must check collisions at each freeway.\n\nFirst, we need to know the car positions at these turns.\n\nLet me compute for freeways 1 to 8 at turns 9 to 17.\n\nGeneral: for a car (h, tau, d, s) at t1=4, at turn T (>=4), the span is:\nif right: [tau + s*(T-4), h + s*(T-4)]\nif left: [h - s*(T-4), tau - s*(T-4)]\n\nBut all cars in this problem are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car given as (head, tail, right, s): span at T: [tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)]\n\nNow, we are at turn8: we are at y0. Then we start moving up.\n\nturn8: at y0 -> safe (no freeway)\nturn8 action: U -> so at turn9: y1.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn9:\nFreeway1: car (-24,-35,right,12): \nspan = [-35 + 12*(9-4) = -35+12*5 = -35+60=25, -24+12*5= -24+60=36] -> [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nturn9: action U -> turn10: y2.\nFreeway2: car (-24,-35,right,6): \nspan at T=10: [-35+6*(10-4)= -35+6*6=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nturn10: U -> turn11: y3.\nFreeway3: same car as freeway2: at T=11: [-35+6*(11-4)= -35+6*7=-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nturn11: U -> turn12: y4.\nFreeway4: same: T=12: [-35+6*8=-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nturn12: U -> turn13: y5.\nFreeway5: same: T=13: [-35+6*9=-35+54=19, -24+54=30] -> [19,30] -> safe.\n\nturn13: U -> turn14: y6.\nFreeway6: same: T=14: [-35+6*10=-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 and 8 have three cars. We haven't encountered them yet because we are at y6. Now we go to y7 at turn15.\n\nturn14: U -> turn15: y7.\nFreeway7: three cars:\n1. (-24,-35,right,6): at T=15: [ -35+6*11 = -35+66=31, -24+66=42] -> [31,42] -> safe (0 not in)\n2. (12,1,right,6): at T=15: [1+6*11=1+66=67, 12+66=78] -> [67,78] -> safe.\n3. (48,37,right,6): at T=15: [37+6*11=37+66=103, 48+66=114] -> [103,114] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nturn15: U -> turn16: y8.\nFreeway8: same three cars? \n1. (-24,-35,right,6) -> [31,42] (same as above) -> safe.\n2. (12,1,right,6) -> [67,78] -> safe.\n3. (48,37,right,6) -> [103,114] -> safe.\n\nThen turn16: U -> turn17: y9 -> safe.\n\nSo this sequence: \nWe go down at turn4 to y0, then stay at y0 for turns 5,6,7,8? But we don't need to stay that long. We only need to avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn8. So we can leave y0 earlier? But we must be at a safe row at turn8.\n\nWe are at y0 at turn5 (after going down at turn4). Then we can stay at y0 until turn8? Then at turn8 we are at y0. Then we start going up at turn8.\n\nBut we can also leave y0 earlier, as long as at turn8 we are not on freeways 2-6.\n\nWhat if we go up from y0 at turn6? Then:\nturn4: D -> turn5: y0\nturn5: S (stay) -> turn6: y0\nturn6: U -> turn7: y1\nturn7: U -> turn8: y2 -> but at turn8, freeway2: the car is at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up at turn5: \nturn4: D -> turn5: y0\nturn5: U -> turn6: y1\nturn6: U -> turn7: y2\nturn7: U -> turn8: y3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay at y0 until at least turn8? Then at turn8 we are at y0, and then we go up.\n\nBut at turn8 we are at y0, then we go up at turn8: to y1 at turn9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn4: D (to y0 at turn5)\nTurn5: S (stay at y0 at turn6)\nTurn6: S (stay at y0 at turn7)\nTurn7: S (stay at y0 at turn8)\nTurn8: U (to y1 at turn9)\nTurn9: U (to y2 at turn10)\nTurn10: U (to y3 at turn11)\nTurn11: U (to y4 at turn12)\nTurn12: U (to y5 at turn13)\nTurn13: U (to y6 at turn14)\nTurn14: U (to y7 at turn15)\nTurn15: U (to y8 at turn16)\nTurn16: U (to y9 at turn17)\n\nTotal turns: from turn4 to turn17, so H = 13 moves? (from t=4 to t=16: 13 actions? Let's count: \nactions at turns: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 -> 13 actions, and we reach y9 at turn17.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid the unsafe turn8 by being at a safe freeway at turn8. The only safe freeways at turn8 are freeway1, freeway7, freeway8? \n\nFreeway1 at turn8: we computed: [13,24] -> safe.\nFreeway7 and 8: we have multiple cars. Let's check freeway7 at turn8:\n\nFreeway7: three cars:\n1. (-24,-35,right,6): at T=8: [ -35+6*4=-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n2. (12,1,right,6): at T=8: [1+6*4=1+24=25, 12+24=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n3. (48,37,right,6): [37+24=61, 48+24=72] -> safe.\n\nBut the first car on freeway7 at turn8 is at [-11,0] -> so if we are on freeway7 at turn8, we collide with that car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same three cars? So same unsafe.\n\nTherefore, at turn8, the only safe freeway is freeway1? Because freeway1 has a car at [13,24] (which doesn't include 0) and no other car? \n\nFreeway1 has only one car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> at turn8: [ -35+12*4 = -35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at freeway1 at turn8.\n\nHow to get to freeway1 (y1) at turn8? \n\nWe start at y1 at turn4. We can stay at y1 for several turns? \n\nBut at turn5: we are at y1. Check freeway1 at turn5: \ncar: [ -35+12*(5-4)= -35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nturn6: freeway1: [ -35+12*2=-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, turn7: freeway1: [ -35+12*3=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not in).\n\nturn8: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at freeway1 at turn4,5,7,8? But not at turn6.\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nWe are at y1 at turn4 (safe).\n\nWe must avoid freeway1 at turn6.\n\nWe can leave freeway1 at turn5? \n\nOption: \nturn4: stay at y1? But then at turn5 we are still at y1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn5: safe).\n\nThen at turn5: we need to leave because at turn6 we cannot be at y1. So we can go up to y2 or down to y0.\n\nIf we go down to y0 at turn5: then at turn6 we are at y0 (safe). Then we can come back to y1 at turn7? \n\nturn5: D -> to y0 at turn6.\nturn6: U -> to y1 at turn7.\n\nThen at turn7: we are at y1 -> freeway1: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7: we can stay at y1? Then at turn8 we are at y1 -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up from turn8.\n\nBut we want minimal turns. We lost some turns: we went down and then up, so we are still at y1 at turn8, same as we started? Then we have to go up 8 moves to y9 -> that would be from turn8 to turn16: 8 moves, so total from turn4 to turn16: 13 moves again? Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, from y1 at turn4, we can go up to y2 at turn5? \n\nturn4: U -> to y2 at turn5.\n\nAt turn5: y2 -> check freeway2: car (-24,-35,right,6) at T=5: [ -35+6*1=-29, -24+6=-18] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we can go up to y3 at turn6? \nturn5: U -> turn6: y3 -> freeway3: at T=6: [-35+6*2=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we can go up to y4 at turn7? \nturn6: U -> turn7: y4 -> freeway4: at T=7: [-35+6*3=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7: we want to avoid being at y4 at turn8? Because freeway4 at turn8 is unsafe. So we can go up to y5? But freeway5 at turn8 is unsafe. Or down to y3? freeway3 at turn8 unsafe. Or stay? unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave the freeways 2-6 by turn8? \n\nWe are at y4 at turn7. We need to get to a safe row by turn8. The safe rows at turn8 are y0, y1, y7, y8, y9? \n\nBut we are at y4. We cannot get to y7 in one move. So only y0 and y1 are reachable? But we can go down to y3 at turn8? but y3 is unsafe. So we must go down to y0? But that would take 4 moves: from y4 to y0: 4 downs. We have only one move: from turn7 to turn8: so we can only go to y3.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nAnother idea: we can go up to y5 at turn7? Then at turn7: y5 -> freeway5: at T=7: [-35+6*3=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe? But then at turn8: if we stay, we go to y5 at turn8 -> unsafe. If we go up to y6 at turn8: then freeway6 at turn8: [-11,0] -> unsafe. If we go down to y4 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option is to go down to y0 at turn4 and wait until turn8, then go up. That takes 13 moves.\n\nBut we note that at turn8, freeway1 is safe. So we can be at y1 at turn8. \n\nWe are at y1 at turn4. We can stay at y1 at turn4 and turn5? Then at turn5 we are at y1. Then we must leave at turn5 to avoid being at y1 at turn6 (unsafe). \n\nWhere to go? \n- If we go up to y2 at turn6: then at turn6: freeway2: unsafe (because freeway2 at turn6: [-23,-12] -> safe? Wait, freeway2 at turn6: \ncar: (-24,-35,right,6): T=6: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we are at y2. Then we can go up to y3 at turn7: freeway3: T=7: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7: we are at y3. Then we must avoid being at freeways 2-6 at turn8? We are at y3, which is freeway3 -> unsafe at turn8.\n\nSo we need to get to y1 at turn8? \n\nAt turn7, we are at y3. We can go down to y2 at turn8? But freeway2 at turn8: [-11,0] -> unsafe. Or to y1? \nturn7: D -> to y2 at turn8? unsafe. \nturn7: D twice? We can only do one move.\n\nAlternatively, from turn5: instead of going up, we go down to y0 at turn6? \nturn4: S (stay at y1) -> safe.\nturn5: D -> to y0 at turn6 -> safe.\nturn6: we are at y0. Then we can go up to y1 at turn7: \nturn6: U -> to y1 at turn7 -> freeway1: T=7: [ -35+12*3= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\nturn7: we can stay at y1? Then at turn8: y1 -> freeway1: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn8: we are at y1. Then we start going up.\n\nSequence:\nturn4: S (y1)\nturn5: D (y0 at turn6? Actually: \nturn4: S -> at turn5: still y1? Then turn5: D -> at turn6: y0.\nSo:\nturn4: S -> at turn5: y1\nturn5: D -> at turn6: y0\nturn6: U -> at turn7: y1\nturn7: S (or U? We can start going up) -> if we stay at turn7: then at turn8: y1 (safe). Then we go up.\n\nBut we want minimal H. We are at y1 at turn8. Then we need to go up 8 moves to y9: so turns 8 to 15: 8 moves? Then total moves: turns4 to 15: 12 moves? \n\nList:\n\nTurn4: S -> at turn5: y1\nTurn5: D -> at turn6: y0\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: y1\nTurn7: S -> at turn8: y1  (or we can go up at turn7? Then we would be at y2 at turn8 -> unsafe, so we must stay at turn7 to be at y1 at turn8)\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: y2\nTurn9: U -> at turn10: y3\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: y4\nTurn11: U -> at turn12: y5\nTurn12: U -> at turn13: y6\nTurn13: U -> at turn14: y7\nTurn14: U -> at turn15: y8\nTurn15: U -> at turn16: y9\n\nBut we reached y9 at turn16? And we started at turn4. The moves are from turn4 to turn15 (inclusive) -> 12 moves.\n\nBut we must check the freeways as we go up from turn8 to turn16.\n\nWe already checked from turn9 to turn16 for freeways 1 to 8 in the previous plan? But in this plan, we are going through the freeways at different turns.\n\nSpecifically, we are at:\nturn8: y1 (safe, as we know)\nturn9: y2 -> freeway2 at turn9: \ncar: (-24,-35,right,6): T=9: [-35+6*5=-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is in this interval? -5<=0<=6 -> yes! So collision.\n\nOh no! At turn9, freeway2 has a car covering 0.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at turn9.\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at turn9.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nWe can delay or accelerate our movement.\n\nSince we are at y1 at turn8, we can wait at y1 until it is safe to go up.\n\nAt turn8: y1 -> safe.\nWe can stay at y1 for more turns? \n\nCheck freeway1 at turn9: \ncar: (-24,-35,right,12): T=9: [-35+12*5=-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo we can stay at y1 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nThen at turn9: we go up to y2? But at turn10: we are at y2 -> check freeway2 at turn10: \nT=10: [-35+6*6=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not in).\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nturn4: S -> turn5: y1 (safe: freeway1 at turn5: [-23,-12] safe)\nturn5: D -> turn6: y0 (safe)\nturn6: U -> turn7: y1 (safe: freeway1 at turn7: [1,12] safe)\nturn7: S -> turn8: y1 (safe: [13,24] safe)\nturn8: S -> turn9: y1 (safe: [25,36] safe)\nturn9: U -> turn10: y2 (freeway2: [1,12] at turn10: safe? But wait, at turn10: T=10, freeway2: [-35+6*(10-4)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe)\nturn10: U -> turn11: y3 (freeway3: T=11: [-35+6*7=-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> [7,18] safe)\nturn11: U -> turn12: y4 (freeway4: T=12: [-35+6*8=-35+48=13, -24+48=24] safe)\nturn12: U -> turn13: y5 (freeway5: T=13: [-35+6*9=-35+54=19, -24+54=30] safe)\nturn13: U -> turn14: y6 (freeway6: T=14: [-35+6*10=25, -24+60=36] safe)\nturn14: U -> turn15: y7 (freeway7: T=15: \ncar1: [-35+6*11=31, -24+66=42] -> safe\ncar2: [1+66=67, 12+66=78] -> safe\ncar3: [37+66=103, 48+66=114] -> safe)\nturn15: U -> turn16: y8 (freeway8: same as freeway7 at T=15: safe)\nturn16: U -> turn17: y9\n\nBut we reached y9 at turn17? And we used 13 moves: turns4 to 16.\n\nBut we stayed at y1 for turn7 and turn8, and then at turn9 we went up. But we also stayed at y1 at turn4 and turn5? \n\nAlternatively, after reaching y1 at turn7, we can go up earlier? But we saw that if we go up at turn8 to y2 at turn9, we hit freeway2 at turn9? But in the above we went up at turn9 to y2 at turn10, which was safe.\n\nBut can we go up at turn8? \n\nIf at turn8: we are at y1, and we go up to y2 at turn9 -> then at turn9: freeway2: \ncar at T=9: [-35+6*5=-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway2 at turn9.\n\nSo we either skip freeway2 at turn9 by not being there, or be there at a safe time.\n\nWe can be at freeway2 only when the car is not covering 0.\n\nThe car on freeway2 is at [ -35+6*(T-4), -24+6*(T-4) ]\n\nSet when 0 is in [A, B] where A = -35+6*(T-4), B = -24+6*(T-4)\n\n0 in [A,B] if A<=0<=B.\n\nA<=0: -35+6*(T-4) <=0 -> 6*(T-4)<=35 -> T-4<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=9.833 -> so T<=9 (since T integer)\n0<=B: 0<=-24+6*(T-4) -> 24<=6*(T-4) -> 4<=T-4 -> T>=8.\n\nSo unsafe for T in [8,9]? \n\nT=8: A=-35+24=-11, B=0 -> -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is included.\nT=9: A=-35+30=-5, B=6 -> -5<=0<=6 -> yes.\nT=10: A=-35+36=1, B=12 -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe can be at freeway2 only at T<8 or T>=10.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y2 at turn10 (which is T=10) -> safe.\n\nSo the above sequence is safe, but it takes 13 moves.\n\nWe could try to be at freeway2 earlier? For example, at turn7: T=7: freeway2: [-35+6*3=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe. But then we are at y2 at turn7, and then at turn8 we are at y2 (if we stay) -> unsafe. Or we go up to y3 at turn8: freeway3 at turn8: unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to freeway7 or 8 before turn8? \n\nFrom y1 at turn4, we need 6 moves to get to y7. We have turns 4,5,6,7 -> 4 moves. So we can get to y5 at turn8? But freeway5 at turn8 is unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose we go up as fast as possible and then wait at y6 or y7.\n\nBut at turn7, if we are at y7: \nWe start at y1 at turn4.\nturn4: U -> y2 at turn5 (safe: freeway2 at turn5: [-29,-18] safe)\nturn5: U -> y3 at turn6 (freeway3: [-23,-12] safe)\nturn6: U -> y4 at turn7 (freeway4: [-17,-6] safe)\nturn7: U -> y5 at turn8 (freeway5: [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\nSo we cannot be at y5 at turn8.\n\nIf we go up to y6 at turn7: \nFrom y4 at turn7, we would need two moves: turn7: U to y5 at turn8 (unsafe), then cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y4 by turn7 and then go down? But then we are at y3 or below at turn8, which might be unsafe.\n\nWe know freeways 2-6 are unsafe at turn8.\n\nSo the only safe rows at turn8 are y0, y1, and y7,y8,y9? \n\nBut to get to y7 at turn8: from y1 at turn4: need 6 moves. We have 4 moves: turn4,5,6,7 -> 4 moves: so we can only get to y5.\n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are to be at y0 or y1 at turn8.\n\nWe have two plans that work and take 13 moves.\n\nBut the one that goes down immediately and waits:\n\nPlan A:\nturn4: D -> y0 at turn5\nturn5: S -> y0 at turn6\nturn6: S -> y0 at turn7\nturn7: S -> y0 at turn8\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y3 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y4 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y5 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y6 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y7 at turn15\nturn15: U -> y8 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y9 at turn17\n\nThat's 13 moves.\n\nPlan B (using freeway1 at turn7 and turn8, and then going up from turn9 to turn16):\n\nturn4: S -> y1 at turn5\nturn5: D -> y0 at turn6\nturn6: U -> y1 at turn7\nturn7: S -> y1 at turn8\nturn8: S -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y3 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y4 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y5 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y6 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y7 at turn15\nturn15: U -> y8 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y9 at turn17\n\nAlso 13 moves.\n\nBut in Plan B, at turn9 we are at y1 and then we go up. And we have an extra stay at turn8? \n\nCan we go up earlier from y1? \n\nAt turn8: we are at y1. If we go up at turn8, we go to y2 at turn9 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at y1 until turn9 to then go up at turn9 (arriving at y2 at turn10, which is safe).\n\nBut we are at y1 at turn8. We can go up at turn9? \n\nIn the sequence above, we did go up at turn9.\n\nBut is there a way to save one move? \n\nWhat if we are at y1 at turn8 and then at turn8 we go up? -> to y2 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nOr we can go up at turn7 from y1 to y2? \n\nBut at turn7: we are at y1 (from turn6: U from y0 to y1 at turn7). Then at turn7: we go up to y2 at turn8? But freeway2 at turn8: unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal moves is 13.\n\nBut note that in the first plan (Plan A), we are at y0 for turns 5,6,7,8 (4 turns) and then go up.\n\nIn Plan B, we are at y0 only at turn6, and at y1 for turns4,5,7,8,9? That's more stays.\n\nBut both take 13 moves.\n\nWe can try to reduce by one move.\n\nAlternative: at turn4: go up to y2 at turn5? \nturn4: U -> y2 at turn5 (safe, as freeway2 at turn5: [-29,-18] safe)\nturn5: U -> y3 at turn6 (freeway3: [-23,-12] safe)\nturn6: U -> y4 at turn7 (freeway4: [-17,-6] safe)\nturn7: D -> y3 at turn8 (but freeway3 at turn8: [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\nNot good.\n\nturn7: stay at y4 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nOr turn7: go down to y3 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, we use Plan A or Plan B. Both work.\n\nBut Plan A might be simpler.\n\nWe have to output the sequence.\n\nBut note: in Plan A, at turn8 we go up from y0 to y1 at turn9. Then we go up continuously. And we already computed that from turn9 to turn16, the freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly, Plan B also works.\n\nBut in Plan B, we have to check freeway1 at turn5: we are at y1 at turn5: freeway1: T=5: [-35+12= -23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\nAnd turn6: at y0 -> safe.\n\nturn7: y1: freeway1: T=7: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nturn8: y1: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nturn9: y1: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen the rest is safe.\n\nBoth are 13 moves.\n\nBut is there a 12-move solution?\n\nSuppose we try to be at y9 at turn16 (which is 12 moves from turn4 to turn15).\n\nWe start at y1 at turn4. After 12 moves, we would be at y1+12 = y13, which is beyond 9. So we only need to go up 8 moves. But we may have to move down and up, so net up 8 moves in 12 actions? That means we have 4 extra moves that are down or stay.\n\nWe have to avoid the collision at turn8 on freeways 2-6.\n\nSuppose we go up to y5 by turn7: \nturn4: U -> y2 at turn5\nturn5: U -> y3 at turn6\nturn6: U -> y4 at turn7\nturn7: U -> y5 at turn8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo not.\n\nOr we go up to y4 by turn7 and then down to y0 by turn11? Then up to y9 by turn16? But that would be more than 12 moves.\n\nFor example, from y4 at turn7, we go down for 4 moves to y0 at turn11. Then up 9 moves to y9 at turn20? Too long.\n\nWe can try to wait at a freeway that is safe at turn8. But we saw only freeway1 is safe at turn8.\n\nAnd to be at freeway1 at turn8, we can be there by turn8 without extra moves? We are at y1 at turn4. We can stay at y1 for turns 4,5,7,8? But we have to leave at turn5 and come back.\n\nThe minimal time to leave and come back is: \nturn4: stay -> y1 at turn5\nturn5: down -> y0 at turn6\nturn6: up -> y1 at turn7\nturn7: stay -> y1 at turn8\n\nThat's 4 moves to be back at y1 at turn8.\n\nThen we need to go from y1 to y9: 8 moves: turns8 to 15: 8 moves, total moves: 4+8=12 moves? But we are at turn8: we start moving up at turn8: then turn8: U -> y2 at turn9. But freeway2 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot move up until turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must have 13 moves.\n\nSo we choose Plan A for simplicity.\n\nPlan A sequence:\n\nTurn4: D\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: S\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\n\nBut we need to reach y9 at turn17, and we do.\n\nIn the answer format, we list actions for turns starting at t1=4 up to the last action before reaching y9.\n\nWe reach y9 at turn17, so the last action is at turn16: U.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nTotal 13 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to save one action by not staying so long at y0?\n\nWe only need to be at a safe row at turn8. We are at y0 from turn5 to turn8. But we can leave y0 at turn8 by going up? But we are already doing that.\n\nWe can leave earlier if we can be at y1 at turn8 by a different route.\n\nBut we already have a route that takes 4 moves to be at y1 at turn8: \nturn4: S (y1 at turn5)\nturn5: D (y0 at turn6)\nturn6: U (y1 at turn7)\nturn7: S (y1 at turn8)\n\nThat's 4 moves, and then we need to go up 8 moves from turn8 to turn15: total 12 moves? But then we are at y9 at turn16? \n\nBut at turn8: we are at y1. Then we do:\n\nturn8: U -> y2 at turn9 (unsafe) -> so we cannot.\n\nWe must wait at y1 at turn8 and turn9? Then at turn9: S (y1 at turn10) -> then we can go up at turn10: U to y2 at turn11? But then we are late.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nturn8: S -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10 (safe, because freeway2 at turn10: [1,12] safe)\nthen turn10: U to y3 at turn11, etc.\n\nSo:\nturn4: S\nturn5: D\nturn6: U\nturn7: S\nturn8: S\nturn9: U\nturn10: U\nturn11: U\nturn12: U\nturn13: U\nturn14: U\nturn15: U\nturn16: U\n\nStill 13 moves, and we reach y9 at turn17.\n\nSame length.\n\nTherefore, we output the first plan for clarity.\n\nBut note: in the first plan, we are at y0 for turns 5,6,7,8. Then we go up.\n\nWe can shorten the stay at y0 if we can be at y1 at turn8 by only three moves? \n\nHow? \nWe are at y1 at turn4.\nWe can go down at turn4: to y0 at turn5.\nThen at turn5: U -> to y1 at turn6.\nThen at turn6: we are at y1 at turn6: but freeway1 at turn6: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must either have three stays at y0 (as in Plan A) or use the extra move to come back.\n\nSo both ways are 13 moves.\n\nWe'll output Plan A.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut wait, in Plan A, after turn16 U, we are at turn17: y9. So H=13 moves? Yes.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision at turn9: we are at y1 -> freeway1: [25,36] safe.\nturn9: U -> to y2 at turn10: freeway2: [1,12] safe? At turn10: T=10, freeway2: [ -35+6*6= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo it works.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The solution involves moving down to \\(y = 0\\) (a safe row, as it is not a freeway) and waiting until turn 8 to avoid collisions on freeways 2-6 at turn 8, where cars cover \\(x = 0\\). Then, the player moves up continuously to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Solution Explanation:\n- **Turn 4 (current turn)**: The player is at \\(y = 1\\). Moving down (D) to \\(y = 0\\) avoids any freeway collision.\n- **Turns 5 to 7**: Staying (S) at \\(y = 0\\) ensures safety, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway.\n- **Turn 8**: Moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) is safe, as the car on freeway 1 at turn 8 is at \\([13, 24]\\), not covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Turns 9 to 16**: Continuously moving up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 17. The car positions on each freeway are checked for collisions at the respective turns:\n  - **Turn 9**: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 car at \\([25, 36]\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 10**: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 car at \\([1, 12]\\) (safe, 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 11**: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 car at \\([7, 18]\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 12**: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 car at \\([13, 24]\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 13**: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 car at \\([19, 30]\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 14**: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 car at \\([25, 36]\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 15**: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 cars at \\([31, 42]\\), \\([67, 78]\\), \\([103, 114]\\) (all safe).\n  - **Turn 16**: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 cars at \\([31, 42]\\), \\([67, 78]\\), \\([103, 114]\\) (all safe).\n- **Turn 17**: The player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is safe and the goal.\n\nThis sequence requires 13 turns (from turn 4 to turn 16) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17, which is minimal given the collision constraints.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=5, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The key point is that when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I only enter y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn, starting from t=5.\n\nThe car update rules: for each car, given its state at t₁=5, I can find its span at any turn T > 5.\n\nThe span is given for left-moving or right-moving. Direction: right-moving means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the head and tail both increase by s per turn. Similarly, left-moving decreases.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"direction d\", and in the examples, it's \"right\" for all, so all cars are right-moving in this case.\n\nLet me list all cars:\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: head h=-12, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, at turn T, span = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]? Let's see the rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h - s(T-t₁) and τ - s(T-t₁), so if h > τ, then as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the freeway 1 car: head h=-12, tail τ=-23, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) is given as [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But in the table it says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", so for freeway 1: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12.\n\nFor right-moving, the span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-23, -12], I think, because τ is tail, h is head, and since moving right, tail is left, head is right, so span is from τ to h, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be from h to τ, decreasing, but here all are right.\n\nSo for right-moving car, at turn t₁, span is [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with τ ≤ h.\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nt₁ = 5.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: τ = -23, h = -12, s=12, d=right.\n\nAt turn T, span: [ -23 + 12(T-5) , -12 + 12(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: h=-18, τ=-29, s=6, d=right\n\nSpan at T: [ -29 + 6(T-5) , -18 + 6(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? h=-18, τ=-29, s=6, d=right\n\nIn table: freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k (y_T = k), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) at turn T.\n\nSince span is [low, high] for right-moving cars, where low = τ + s(T-5), high = h + s(T-5), and 0 is in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at t=5. y=0 is not a freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars.\n\nThe player position is at (0,y), and freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars. y=0 and y=9 are the ends, probably no cars, so safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, safe.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway, I need to not have 0 in any car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I go to y_{T+1}, at turn T I am on y_T, and I only consider cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=5, and I need to end at y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut since I can only move one step at a time, the min possible is 9 turns if I can go straight up without stopping.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible or if cars block.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each k=1 to 8, and for each T, is there a car on freeway k such that at turn T, 0 is in its span.\n\nIf yes, then I cannot be on freeway k at turn T.\n\nNow, t starts from t=5 onwards.\n\nLet me define the time offset: let τ = T - 5, so at τ=0, turn T=5.\n\nFor each freeway, find when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -23 + 12τ , -12 + 12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12τ\n\nSo -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 12τ\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 => 12τ ≤ 23 => τ ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so τ ≤ 1 since τ integer? τ is turn offset, so integer.\n\nT is turn number, so T=5,6,7,... so τ=0,1,2,3,... integer.\n\nSimilarly, all times integer.\n\nSo -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 => 12τ ≤ 23 => τ ≤ 23/12 ≈1.916, so τ=0,1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 12τ => 12τ ≥12 => τ ≥1\n\nSo for τ=1 only.\n\nτ=0: -23 +0 = -23 ≤0, but 0 ≤ -12 +0 = -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so not.\n\nτ=1: -23+12= -11 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -12+12=0 true, 0≤0 true.\n\nτ=2: -23+24=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false.\n\nSo at τ=1, which is T=6, 0 is covered.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: car: τ=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\nSpan at τ: [ -29 +6τ , -18 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -29 +6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -18 +6τ\n\nFirst: -29 +6τ ≤0 => 6τ ≤29 => τ ≤ 29/6 ≈4.833, so τ=0 to 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18 +6τ => 6τ ≥18 => τ ≥3\n\nSo τ from 3 to 4 inclusive.\n\nτ=3: -29+18= -11 ≤0 true, 0≤ -18+18=0 true\n\nτ=4: -29+24= -5 ≤0 true, 0≤ -18+24=6 true? 0≤6 true\n\nτ=2: -29+12= -17 ≤0 true, but 0≤ -18+12= -6? 0≤-6 false\n\nτ=5: -29+30=1 ≤0 false\n\nSo unsafe at T=5+3=8 and T=5+4=9? τ=3 is T=8, τ=4 is T=9\n\nT=5+τ, τ=3, T=8; τ=4, T=9\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Car is (-18,-29,right,6), same as freeway 2, so same unsafe times: T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=8,9\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-18,-29,right,6), so this car covers 0 when τ from 3 to 4, T=8 and 9.\n\nBut there are other cars.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6)? Head h=18, tail τ=7? In the table: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t₁: [τ, h] = [7,18]? τ=7, h=18.\n\nAt turn T, span: [7 + 6(τ), 18 + 6(τ)] where τ=T-5.\n\n0 in span if 7+6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 18+6τ\n\nBut 7+6τ ≥7 >0 for τ≥0, so 0 ≤ 7+6τ is false since 7+6τ >0, so 0 cannot be ≤ lower bound which is positive. Lower bound is min, upper max.\n\n[low, high] = [7+6τ, 18+6τ], both positive for τ≥0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high] since low>0.\n\nSimilarly, 18+6τ >0, but 0 < low, so not covered.\n\nFor example τ=0, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1, [13,24], etc, all positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (54,43,right,6), span [43+6τ, 54+6τ], all positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car matters, which is same as before, so unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same three cars, so also unsafe at T=8 and T=9 only from the first car.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same, unsafe at τ=3,4 T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6), [7+6τ,18+6τ], min>0, 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: [43+6τ,54+6τ], min>0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo yes, only unsafe at T=8,9 for freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8? Freeway 1 is different.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, and at T=6.\n\nNow, let's summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe (0 covered).\n\nFreeway y=1: unsafe only at T=6\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nAll from above.\n\ny=1 only at T=6, others at T=8,9.\n\nNow, I start at t=5, y=0.\n\nAt t=5, I am at y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\nEach turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 steps up, so min H=9 if I can go straight up.\n\nBut I might be blocked at some points.\n\nNow, let's see if I can go straight up from t=5 to t=13, for example.\n\nStart t=5, y=0.\n\nAfter action, at t=6, I move to some y.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, I go to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T if y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nCollision if at that turn, on that freeway, 0 covered.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I am at y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nI take action a_5, which determines y_6.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + delta_5 = 0 + delta_5.\n\nIf I go up, y_6=1, etc.\n\nAt turn t=6, I am at y_6.\n\nIf y_6 is between 1 and 8, and if freeway y_6 is unsafe at T=6.\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo if at t=6, I am on y=1, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways are safe at T=6, only y=1 unsafe.\n\nNow, at t=7, all freeways safe, since unsafe only at T=6,8,9.\n\nT=7 is safe for all.\n\nT=8 and T=9 unsafe for y=2 to 8.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMin turns: if I go up every turn, from t=5 to t=13: let's list the turns.\n\nt=5: y=0\n\nAfter action a_5, at t=6: y= y_5 + a_5 effect\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSet t=5: y=0\n\nI want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9, I don't need to be on freeway, since y=9 safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nAt turn t=5+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=5 to t=5+H-2? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen the position after H actions: from t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1, before action, position given.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + delta_{t_1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe turn when we reach: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, the position is updated after action, but the turn is when we are at that position.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=5, y_5=0.\n\nWe take action a_5, then at turn t=6, y_6 = y_5 + delta_5\n\nSimilarly, after a_6, y_7, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t_1 + H -1 = 5 + H -1.\n\nSo y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_5 to a_{5 + H -1}, H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t=5, then at t=6, y_6=9? But from y=0, I can't reach y=9 in one action, since max change +1.\n\nSo min H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStarting from y_5=0, after H actions, we are at y_{5+H}.\n\nWe want y_{5+H} =9.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is t_1 + H -1? Let's see the index.\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the last action index.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nContradiction.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1, after taking action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}? No.\n\nThe position is updated after the action.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn T, we are at y_T, we take action a_T, then we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for the collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check collision on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThen after action, we go to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nFor reaching: at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo for turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt T = t_1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, which determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\n- At turn t_1: position y_{t_1} = given, here 0.\n\nWe take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- At turn t_1 +1: position y_{t_1 +1}, take action a_{t_1 +1}, determines y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n\n- At turn t_1 + k: position y_{t_1 + k}, take action a_{t_1 + k}, determines y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe want at some turn, say T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, which are H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, and we want y_{t_1} =9, but here y_5=0, not 9, so H>1.\n\nWith actions, from y_5=0, after H actions, we reach y_{5+H} =9, but the turn when we are at 9 is t_1 + H, not t_1 + H -1.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the problem statement.\n\nLet's read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nNow, when we are at (0,9)? At turn t_1 + H -1, after taking action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we should be at y=9 for that turn.\n\nBut the action at turn T determines y_{T+1}, so at turn T, after action, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the action.\n\nSo at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and we take some action, but since we are at 9, and we might stay or move, but the position is already 9, so to reach it, we need to be there at the start of the turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd at that turn, we take action, but the position is given at the turn.\n\nI think it's standard to have position at turn T before action.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T, then we take action, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nReaching at turn T means y_T = position at that turn.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} determine how we get there from y_5.\n\nFrom y_5 to y_{5 + H -1} =9, with H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, there are (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 + 1 = H turns? Turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 inclusive, that's H turns.\n\nPosition at turn t_1: y_{t_1}\n\nPosition at turn t_1 +1: y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + delta_{a_{t_1}}\n\n...\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + k: y_{t_1 + k} = y_{t_1} + sum of deltas from t= t_1 to t_1 + k -1\n\nFor position at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} delta_{a_{t_1 + i}}  because actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nLet's index the actions.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} , a_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}  H actions.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2, y_{t_1+2}\n\n...\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -2}, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it is determined by the first H-1 actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nThe last action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken at turn t_1 + H -1, but it affects the next turn, not the current position.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it depends on actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we take some action, but since we reached, it might be S or whatever, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1} even though it doesn't affect reaching, but we have to specify it.\n\nFor the position at turn T, it is affected by actions from t_1 to T-1.\n\nFor T = t_1 + H -1, y_T = y_{t_1} + sum of deltas from actions a_{t_1} to a_{T-1} = a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nWith H-1 actions.\n\nBut the action sequence has H actions, including a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is for after reaching.\n\nIn terms of the number of turns to reach, H includes the turn when we reach.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think that with H actions, we can reach y_{t_1 + H} =9, but the turn when we are at 9 is t_1 + H, not t_1 + H -1.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nLet me look back at the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1, we reach (0,9).\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9), and we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is determined by previous actions.\n\nFrom y_5=0, to y_{5 + H -1} =9, with (H-1) actions: from a5 to a_{5 + H -2} for the position at t=5+H-1.\n\nThen a_{5 + H -1} is the action taken at turn t=5+H-1 after reaching.\n\nBut for the sequence, we include it.\n\nFor min H, we can ignore the last action if not necessary, but we have to specify.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, min delta y is +9, so min number of actions to change position is 9, but with stays or down, it could be more.\n\nThe min possible H is when we go up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min H such that we can be at y=9 at turn 5 + H -1.\n\nWith actions, the net displacement must be +9.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0, so to have net +9, number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end: from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, there are H turns, but the position changes between turns.\n\nNumber of actions between position changes.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to turn t_1 + K, there are K steps (actions) to go from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + K}.\n\nFor example, from turn 5 to turn 6, one action, etc.\n\nTo go from y5=0 to y_{5 + M} =9, we need M actions, and M must be at least 9.\n\nThen the turn when we are at 9 is t=5+M, so for reaching at turn t_1 + H -1, we have 5 + M = 5 + H -1, so M = H-1.\n\nThus, with H-1 actions, we go from y5 to y_{5 + (H-1)} = y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen we need H-1 actions to achieve the position, but the sequence has H actions, including the one at the reach turn.\n\nFor min H, we want min such that we can have y_{5 + H -1} =9 with some sequence.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=5 to t=5+H-1 for actions.\n\nAt turn t=5+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThe position at t=5+H-1 is reached after (H-1) actions from t=5.\n\nBut the action at t=5+H-1 is taken after reaching, so for reaching, it doesn't matter, but we must specify it.\n\nIn terms of min H, we can choose a_{5+H-1} arbitrarily, say S, since we are at 9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision during the path.\n\nFor min H, we start with H=9.\n\nIf H=9, then we reach at turn 5+9-1=13.\n\ny13=9.\n\nWith actions from a5 to a12, 8 actions to go from y5 to y13? Let's calculate the number of actions to reach position.\n\nFrom turn 5 to turn 13, there are 8 intervals, so 8 actions determine y6 to y13.\n\nPosition at turn 5: y5\n\nAfter a5, y6\n\nAfter a6, y7\n\n...\nAfter a12, y13\n\nTo have y13=9, it is determined by actions a5 to a12, 8 actions.\n\nThe turn when we reach is turn 13, which is t_1 + H -1 =5+9-1=13, good.\n\nWith 8 actions, net +9 in y, so we must have 9 U and -1 D or something, but since min actions, we should have no D or S if possible.\n\nWith 8 actions, to gain +9 in y, impossible because each action changes y by at most +1, so from y5=0, after k actions, y_{5+k} <= k, so to have y_{5+k} =9, k>=9.\n\nWith k actions, y_{5+k} <= y5 + k = k, so to have y_{5+k}=9, k>=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{5+k} >=0, but here we need +9.\n\nSo for position at turn 5+M, y_{5+M} <= M, so to have 9, M>=9.\n\nM is the number of actions from turn 5 to turn 5+M.\n\nTurn 5+M is reached after M actions from turn 5.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1, let K = H-1, so turn 5 + K, position after K actions from turn 5.\n\ny_{5+K} =0 + sum of deltas, and we want y_{5+K} =9, so K>=9.\n\nThen H-1 = K, so H-1 >=9, H>=10.\n\nH is the number of turns for the action sequence.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T= t_1 + H -1, with y_T=9.\n\nT=5 + H -1.\n\nFrom y5=0 to y_T=9, the number of turns between is (T - 5) turns, but from turn 5 to turn T, there are (T-5) actions that determine y6 to yT.\n\nPosition y5 to yT, there are (T-5) actions: a5 to a_{T-1} determine y6 to yT.\n\nyT is determined by actions a5 to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen at turn T, we take action a_T.\n\nFor yT to be 9, it is determined by actions before turn T.\n\nIn this case, for turn T= t_1 + H -1, y_T=9, determined by actions a_{t_1} to a_{T-1} = a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nThen at turn T, we take action a_T = a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nFor the sequence, we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so the first H-1 actions determine the position at turn t_1 + H -1, and the last action is taken at that turn.\n\nFor min H, we need min H such that with H-1 actions, we can go from y5=0 to y_{5 + H -1} =9, and avoid collisions during the path.\n\ny_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet K = H-1, so we need to go from y5=0 to y_{5+K} =9 with K actions, K>=9.\n\nMin K=9, so min H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen with 9 actions, we can go from y5=0 to y14? Turn at reach: t=5 + H -1 =5+10-1=14.\n\ny14=9.\n\nWith actions a5 to a13, 9 actions, determining y6 to y14.\n\ny6 to y14 are the positions from turn 6 to turn 14.\n\nBut we start at turn 5 y5=0.\n\nAt turn 5, y5=0, safe.\n\nThen we take actions.\n\nFor min H, H=10, reach at turn 14 with y14=9.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier with larger steps, but we can only change by 1 each action, so from 0 to 9, min 9 actions to change, so min to reach at turn 5+9=14? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 5: y5=0\n\nAfter a5, turn 6: y6\n\nAfter a6, turn 7: y7\n\n...\nAfter a13, turn 14: y14\n\nTo have y14=9, with actions a5 to a13, 9 actions.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn 14, with 9 up actions from turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, we are at 0, after 9 ups, at turn 14 we are at 9.\n\nTurn 14 = 5 + 9.\n\nIn terms of H, for reaching at turn t_1 + H -1, 5 + H -1 =14, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a5 to a13 (t=0 to 8 for the index, but actions at t=5 to t=5+9-1=13? H=10, actions t=0 to 9, so a5 to a14? Let's not confuse.\n\nSet H such that actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=10, actions a5 to a14.\n\nBut a5 to a14 determine y6 to y15.\n\nWe want y at turn t_1 + H -1 =5+9=14? 5+10-1=14.\n\ny14=9.\n\ny14 is determined by actions a5 to a13.\n\nAction a14 is at turn 14, which determines y15, not y14.\n\nSo for y14 to be 9, it depends on a5 to a13.\n\nThe sequence includes a14, which is not necessary for reaching y14, but we must include it.\n\nFor min H, we can set a14 to S, for example.\n\nBut we need to check if we can reach y14=9 with a5 to a13 all U, but we may have collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see if it's possible to go straight up with no stops.\n\nStart at t=5, y=0.\n\nTake a5=U, then at t=6, y=1.\n\nAt t=6, y=1, freeway 1, which is unsafe at T=6, as we found earlier, 0 is covered, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=1 at t=6.\n\nSo with a5=U, at t=6 y=1, collision.\n\nSo cannot go directly up at first.\n\nMust avoid being on y=1 at t=6.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=1 is only unsafe at t=6, I can be on y=1 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways are safe except at t=8,9 for y=2 to 8.\n\nt=8 and t=9 unsafe for y=2 to 8.\n\nNow, I need to go from 0 to 9.\n\nMin H, so try to reach as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible to reach y=9: if no cars, at turn 14, as above.\n\nBut with cars, may be later.\n\nSince y=1 unsafe at t=6, I can go to y=1 at t=7 or later.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times:\n\nFor each freeway, the turns when it is unsafe:\n\ny=1: only t=6\n\ny=2: t=8 and t=9\n\ny=3: t=8,9\n\ny=4: t=8,9\n\ny=5: t=8,9\n\ny=6: t=8,9\n\ny=7: t=8,9\n\ny=8: t=8,9\n\nAll other times are safe for all freeways.\n\nNow, I start at t=5, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nT must be such that if T is between 1 and 8, it must not be unsafe at that turn, but y=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nThe issue is during the path.\n\nNow, to reach quickly, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe points.\n\nFor example, at t=6, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nSo at t=6, I should not be on y=1.\n\nOptions: at t=6, I can be on y=0, or y=2, or other, but from y=0 at t=5, with one action, I can go to y=0 (S), y=1 (U), or y=0 (D), but y=0, D would go to y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so from y=0, D is invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not in [0,9], so I think D is not allowed when y=0, similarly U not at y=9.\n\nThe problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so actions are constrained.\n\nFrom y=0, possible actions: S (y=0) or U (y=1), not D.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, S or D, not U.\n\nAt t=5, y=0, I can do S or U.\n\nIf I do U at t=5, at t=6 y=1, but y=1 at t=6 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot do U at t=5.\n\nMust do S at t=5, so at t=6, y=0.\n\nThen at t=6, y=0, I can do U or S.\n\nIf I do U at t=6, at t=7 y=1.\n\nAt t=7, y=1 is safe, since only unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, I can proceed.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, I need to avoid being on y=2 to 8.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are the unsafe turns for y=2-8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I start with S at t=5, so t=6 y=0.\n\nThen at t=6, I can do U, so t=7 y=1.\n\nAt t=7, y=1 safe, I can do U, t=8 y=2.\n\nBut at t=8, y=2 is unsafe, since y=2 unsafe at t=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I do S at t=7, t=8 y=1.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, freeway 1, is it unsafe? y=1 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=8, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I can be on y=1 at t=8.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I do D at t=7, but y=1, D to y=0, which is safe, but not progress.\n\nBetter to stay or go up.\n\nLet's list a possible sequence.\n\nTarget: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest: if no delays, at t=14.\n\nBut with delays, later.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, y=2 to 8 are unsafe, I need to not be on those freeways at those turns.\n\nOptions: be on y=0, y=1, or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=0 and y=1 are safe at t=8,9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut y=1 is only freeway 1, which is safe except t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, I can be on y=0, y=1, or y=9.\n\nIf I am on y=1 at t=8, I can go up later.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to pass through the freeways.\n\nSince the unsafe period is short, I can delay my movement.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 or y=1 during t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, all freeways are safe.\n\nt=10 onwards, all safe.\n\nSo I can go up freely after t=9.\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nStart t=5, y=0.\n\nMust avoid y=1 at t=6.\n\nSo at t=5, do S: a5=S, so t=6 y=0.\n\nAt t=6, y=0, I can do U: a6=U, so t=7 y=1.\n\nAt t=7, y=1 safe, I can do U: a7=U, so t=8 y=2.\n\nBut at t=8, y=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=7, instead of U, do S: a7=S, so t=8 y=1.\n\nAt t=8, y=1, which is safe, since y=1 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nThen at t=8, I am on y=1, I can do action.\n\nIf I do U, a8=U, then t=9 y=2.\n\nBut at t=9, y=2 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I do S at t=8, a8=S, t=9 y=1.\n\nAt t=9, y=1 safe.\n\nThen after t=9, I can go up.\n\nSo at t=9, y=1, I do U, a9=U, t=10 y=2.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=9, to y=9.\n\ny=2 to y=8 are safe after t=9, so I can go up each turn.\n\nFrom t=10 y=2, to t=11 y=3, ..., up to t=17 y=9.\n\nt=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8, t=17 y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=17, y=9.\n\nNow, what is H?\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1 =17.\n\nt_1=5, so 5 + H -1 =17, thus H=13.\n\nActions from a5 to a_{5+13-1}=a17? H=13, actions t=0 to 12, so a5 to a16.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1 =5+12=17, y17=9.\n\nActions a5 to a16.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions from a5 to a16.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=0\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=1\n\nt=7: a7=S, y8=1  (stayed at y=1)\n\nt=8: a8=S, y9=1  (stayed)\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=2\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=3\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=4\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=5\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=6\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=7\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=8\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=9\n\nAt t=17, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H=13, but can we do better?\n\nPerhaps reach earlier by not staying too long.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I did S to stay at y=1, but I could have gone to y=2 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on a safe freeway at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, only y=0, y=1, y=9 are safe, but y=9 is far.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=8, as above.\n\nI could be on y=0 at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=5: S, y6=0\n\nt=6: S, y7=0? a6=S, y7=0\n\nThen at t=7: U, y8=1\n\nThen at t=8: on y=1 safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I need to go up later.\n\nFrom t=7 y=0, a7=U, t=8 y=1.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=1, if I do U, t=9 y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or down, but down to y=0.\n\nSo similar, I stay at y=1 or go down.\n\nBut staying at y=1 at t=8 and t=9 is fine.\n\nThen from t=9 y=1, go up to y=2 at t=10, etc, reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nCan I reach before t=17?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=9 at t=16 or earlier.\n\nBut from y=0, min 9 ups, so earliest at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=14, I need to be at y=9 at the start of t=14.\n\nThat means from t=5 to t=14, 9 actions: a5 to a13 determine y6 to y14.\n\ny14=9.\n\nNow, y6 to y14 must be set with the actions.\n\nBut at intermediate turns, I must not be on unsafe freeways.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, I cannot be on y=2 to 8.\n\nNow, y6: after a5, y6 must not be 1 if t=6.\n\ny6 cannot be 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y8 cannot be in 2-8, so y8 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for y9.\n\nNow, since we start from y5=0, and go to y14=9, net +9 in 9 actions, so must have exactly 9 U and 0 S or D, so all actions must be U.\n\nBut if all U, then:\n\na5=U, y6=1\n\nBut at t=6, y6=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I have some S or D, but to have net +9 in 9 actions, I must have 9 U and 0 others, so only all U possible, but that causes collision at t=6.\n\nThus, impossible to reach at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15: y15=9.\n\nWith 10 actions? From y5 to y15, 10 actions: a5 to a14 determine y6 to y15.\n\ny15=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 10 actions to go from y5 to y15, net +9, so I can have 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 1 D but net less, etc.\n\nMin net per action +1 if U, but with S or D, net less.\n\nTo have net +9 in 10 actions, possible with 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 1 D but y decreases, so not, or 9 U and 1 D, net +8, not +9.\n\nActions: each U: +1, S: 0, D: -1.\n\nNet displacement: number U minus number D.\n\nNumber of actions: let N_u, N_s, N_d, N_u + N_s + N_d = 10\n\nNet delta y = N_u - N_d = 9\n\nAlso, y15 = y5 + net = 0 + 9 =9.\n\nSo N_u - N_d =9\n\nN_u + N_s + N_d =10\n\nSubtract: (N_u + N_s + N_d) - (N_u - N_d) =10 -9 => N_s + 2 N_d =1\n\nSince N_s and N_d non-negative integers, possible only if N_d=0, N_s=1, then N_u=9.\n\nOr if N_d=1, then N_s +2=1, N_s=-1 impossible.\n\nSo only possibility: N_u=9, N_s=1, N_d=0.\n\nSo 9 Up and 1 Stay in 10 actions.\n\nNow, the stay can be at some turn.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, cannot be on y=1.\n\nAt t=8, cannot be on y=2-8.\n\nAt t=9, cannot be on y=2-8.\n\nNow, positions: start t=5 y=0\n\nAfter actions a5 to a14, y6 to y15.\n\ny15=9.\n\nThe positions y_t for t=6 to t=14 must be safe when on freeway.\n\ny_t for t=6 to t=14, if y_t between 1 and 8, must not be unsafe at that turn.\n\nUnsafe turns: t=6 for y=1; t=8 and t=9 for y=2-8.\n\nSince we have one stay, the path has one turn where y does not change.\n\nNow, let's list the required positions.\n\ny5=0\n\ny6: after a5, must not be 1 if we care about t=6 collision, but at t=6, position y6, if y6=1, unsafe.\n\ny6 must not be 1.\n\nSimilarly, y8 must not be in {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, so y8 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\nSimilarly y9 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\nBut y9=9 possible, but we are going to y15=9, but y9 could be 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, with 9 U and 1 S, the y positions increase by 1 each U, stay at one S.\n\nStart from y5=0.\n\nAfter first action, y6 = y5 + delta_a5.\n\nSince we have to avoid y6=1, and y6 must be integer.\n\nPossible y6: if a5=S, y6=0; if a5=U, y6=1 but cannot, so must a5=S, y6=0.\n\na5 must be S, so y6=0.\n\nThen from y6=0, we have 9 more actions (a6 to a14) to reach y15=9 with net +9, but from y6=0 to y15=9, net +9 in 9 actions, so must all be U, no stay left.\n\nBut we have one stay in the 10 actions a5 to a14.\n\na5 is S, which is the stay.\n\nThen a6 to a14 must all be U to go from y6=0 to y15=9 in 9 steps.\n\ny6=0, a6=U, y7=1\n\na7=U, y8=2\n\nBut at t=8, y8=2, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I do S at some point, but I have no S left, since a5 was the only S, and a6 to a14 all U.\n\ny7=1, which at t=7 is safe.\n\ny8=2 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid y8=2, I need y8 not in 2-8.\n\nBut y8=2 from above.\n\nUnless I do not go up at a7.\n\nBut from y7=1, if a7=S, y8=1, which is safe.\n\nBut in this case, with a5=S, y6=0\n\na6=U, y7=1\n\na7=S, y8=1\n\nThen from y8=1, I need to reach y15=9 in 7 actions: a8 to a14.\n\nNet +8 needed (from y8=1 to y15=9).\n\nWith 7 actions, net +8 impossible, since max +7 with all U.\n\ny15 = y8 + sum of deltas from a8 to a14.\n\n7 actions, max y15=1+7=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf I have D, worse.\n\nSo impossible to reach y15=9 if I stay at y=1 at t=8.\n\nThus, with 10 actions to reach y15=9, not possible.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier turns.\n\nNow, t=16: y16=9.\n\nReach at turn 16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, 5 + H -1=16, H=12.\n\nActions a5 to a15 (since actions t=0 to 11 for H=12, a5 to a16? H=12, actions t=0 to 11, a5 to a16, but determine y6 to y17.\n\nWe want y at turn 16.\n\ny16=9.\n\nDetermined by actions a5 to a15.\n\n11 actions to go from y5=0 to y16=9, net +9.\n\nN_u - N_d =9\n\nN_u + N_s + N_d =11\n\nThen N_s + 2 N_d = (N_u + N_s + N_d) - (N_u - N_d) =11-9=2\n\nSo N_s + 2 N_d =2\n\nPossibilities: N_d=0, N_s=2; or N_d=1, N_s=0.\n\nCase 1: N_u=9, N_s=2, N_d=0\n\nCase 2: N_u=10, N_d=1, N_s=0\n\nBut net N_u - N_d=9, if N_u=10, N_d=1, net=9, yes.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, at t=6, y6 cannot be 1.\n\nAt t=8, y8 cannot be in 2-8.\n\nAt t=9, y9 cannot be in 2-8.\n\nNow, y5=0.\n\ny6 must not be 1, so a5 cannot be U, must be S or D, but D not possible from y=0, so a5=S, y6=0.\n\nThen y6=0.\n\nNow, from here, we have cases.\n\nFirst, case with N_s=2, N_u=9, N_d=0.\n\nSince a5=S, one S used, so one more S and 9 U in a6 to a15? Actions a5 to a15, 11 actions.\n\na5 is S.\n\nThen a6 to a15: 10 actions, but we need net to y16=9 from y6=0, so +9 in 10 actions? y16 determined by a5 to a15, but y16 = y5 + sum_{i=5 to 15} delta a_i, but a_i at turn i affects y_{i+1}.\n\ny16 = y5 + sum_{k=5}^{15} delta a_k\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + delta a_t\n\nSo y16 = y5 + delta a5 + delta a6 + ... + delta a15\n\n11 deltas.\n\ny16=9, y5=0, so sum delta =9.\n\nWith N_u=9, N_s=2, N_d=0, but a5 is one S, so in the 11 actions, one S is a5, and another S, and 9 U.\n\na5 is included.\n\nNow, the positions.\n\ny6=0 (since a5=S)\n\nThen we need to set a6 to a15 such that y16=9 with 9 U and 1 S in 10 actions? a6 to a15 are 10 actions.\n\ny16 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{15} delta a_i\n\ny6=0, y16=9, so sum_{i=6}^{15} delta a_i =9\n\n10 actions: must be 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 0 S but net+10>9, not, or with D not.\n\nSo 9 U and 1 S in a6 to a15.\n\nSimilarly, if case with N_u=10, N_d=1, N_s=0, but a5=S, so N_u=10, N_d=1, but a5=S, not U or D, contradiction.\n\nIn case 2: N_u=10, N_d=1, N_s=0 for all 11 actions.\n\nBut a5=S, which is N_s, so if N_s=0, cannot have S, contradiction.\n\nThus only case 1 possible: N_u=9, N_s=2, N_d=0.\n\nWith a5=S, so one S and one more S later, and 9 U.\n\nNow, the additional S can be at some turn.\n\nNow, positions: y6=0\n\nThen a6 to a15: 10 actions with 9 U and 1 S.\n\ny7 to y16.\n\ny16=9.\n\nNow, y_t for t=6 to 15 must be safe when on freeway.\n\nt=6: y6=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=7: y7, if between 1-8, must safe. t=7 all safe except if y=1 at t=6, but t=7 is safe for all.\n\nt=7 no unsafe, only t=6,8,9 unsafe.\n\nt=7 all freeways safe.\n\nt=8: y8 must not be in 2-8, so y8=0,1,9\n\nt=9: y9=0,1,9\n\nt=10 to 15: all safe.\n\nNow, from y6=0, with actions a6 to a15, 10 actions, 9U and 1S.\n\ny7 = y6 + delta a6\n\nSince y6=0, a6 can be U or S (not D).\n\nIf a6=U, y7=1\n\nIf a6=S, y7=0\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, y8 must be 0,1, or 9.\n\nBut y8 is after 2 actions from y6.\n\ny6=0\n\nAfter a6: y7\n\nAfter a7: y8\n\ny8 must be 0,1,9.\n\nSimilarly, y9 must be 0,1,9.\n\nBut since we are going up, y9=9 possible only if we reach early.\n\nNow, let's see possible.\n\nFirst, suppose at t=8, y8=1.\n\nThen y8=1.\n\ny8=1 is acceptable for t=8.\n\nThen from y8=1, we need to go to y16=9 in 8 actions: a8 to a15.\n\nNet +8 needed.\n\nWith 8 actions, max +8 if all U.\n\nBut we have one S in a6 to a15, and a6 and a7 used so far.\n\na6 to a15 have 10 actions, with 9U and 1S.\n\nIf y8=1, that means from y6=0 to y8=1, net +1 in 2 actions (a6 and a7).\n\nSo a6 and a7: one U and one S, or other.\n\nPossibilities: a6=U, a7=S: y7=1, y8=1\n\nOr a6=S, a7=U: y7=0, y8=1\n\nOr a6=U, a7=U: y7=1, y8=2 but y8=2 not allowed, since must not be in 2-8.\n\ny8 must be 0,1,9, so y8=2 not possible.\n\nThus only if a6 and a7 not both U.\n\nEither:\n\n- a6=U, a7=S: y7=1, y8=1\n\n- or a6=S, a7=U: y7=0, y8=1\n\n- or a6=S, a7=S: y7=0, y8=0\n\nBut y8=0 or 1.\n\nNow, similarly for y9.\n\nBut let's first set.\n\nNow, we have the S to place.\n\nIn a6 to a15, one S.\n\nIf we use a7=S, for example.\n\nCase: a6=U, a7=S: then y7=1, y8=1\n\ny8=1, good for t=8.\n\nNow at t=9, y9 must be 0,1,9.\n\ny9 = y8 + delta a8 =1 + delta a8\n\nIf a8=U, y9=2, not allowed.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=1, allowed.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=0, allowed.\n\nBut we need to go up, D is counter.\n\nNow, from here, y9=1 if a8=S or a8=D.\n\nBut we have N_u=9 to achieve, so far a6=U (one U), a7=S (one S), a8 to a15: 8 actions.\n\ny9=1 if a8=S or D.\n\nThen from y9=1 to y16=9, need +8 in 7 actions (a9 to a15), but 7 actions max +7, cannot +8 unless all U, but +7 to y16=8<9.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=2, but y9=2 not allowed, collision at t=9.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf a6=S, a7=U: y7=0, y8=1\n\nThen y8=1.\n\nThen a8: if U, y9=2 not allowed; if S, y9=1; if D, y9=0.\n\nThen similar, if a8=S, y9=1, then from y9=1 to y16=9 need +8 in 7 actions, impossible.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=0, then from y9=0 to y16=9 need +9 in 7 actions, impossible.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf a6=S, a7=S: y7=0, y8=0\n\nThen y8=0, good for t=8.\n\nThen at t=9, y9 must be 0,1,9.\n\ny9 = y8 + delta a8 =0 + delta a8\n\na8 can be U or S.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=1\n\nIf a8=S, y9=0\n\nNow, y9=1 or 0, both allowed for t=9.\n\nSuppose a8=U, y9=1\n\nThen from y9=1 to y16=9 need +8 in 7 actions, impossible.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=0\n\nThen from y9=0 to y16=9 need +9 in 7 actions, impossible.\n\nThus, in all cases, if we have y8=1 or 0, we cannot reach y16=9 because we lose steps.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility for y8 or y9 is to be 9, but y8=9 from y6=0 in two actions impossible.\n\ny8 at most y6 +2 =2, since two actions, max y8=2 if both U, but y8=2 not allowed.\n\ny8 <=2 <9, so y8 cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y9: at most y6 +3=3<9, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, for t=16, it is impossible to have y8 or y9 in {0,1,9} with the constraints.\n\nThus, reaching at t=16 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, t=17 is possible as earlier with H=13.\n\nBut H=13 for reach at t=17.\n\nt_1 + H -1=17, H=13.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach at t=17 with fewer actions by not staying twice.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, we stayed at y=1 for two turns: t=7 and t=8, but at t=7 we stayed, and t=8 stayed.\n\nBut we only needed to avoid t=8 and t=9 for y=2-8.\n\nAt t=7, I could go to y=2, which is safe at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, I need to not be on y=2, so I must move or stay, but if I stay, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo I must change to y=1 or y=3, etc.\n\nBut y=3 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nAll y=2-8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo only safe to be on y=0,1,9 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly t=9.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=7, if I go down to y=1 at t=8, then safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nLet's try.\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=0\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=1\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=2? But at t=8, y8=2 unsafe. Cannot.\n\nAt t=7, from y7=1, I can only go to y=2 (U), y=1 (S), or y=0 (D).\n\nIf U, y8=2 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y8=1 safe.\n\nIf D, y8=0 safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nTo save time, at t=7, do U to y=2 at t=8, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo must not be at y=2-8 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=0 or y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen after t=9, go up.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, go to y=2 at t=10, y=3 at t=11, ..., y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17.\n\nAs before.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=17, with actions from a5 to a16.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=16, we do U to go to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, we are at y=9, and take action, say S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a16 for H=13.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier by being at higher position before t=8.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 before t=8, but impossible since min t=14.\n\nt=14 not possible, t=15 not, t=16 not, so t=17 is earliest possible.\n\nWith H=13.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two stays: at t=5 S, and at t=7 S or t=8 S.\n\nIn my first sequence, I had a5=S, a7=S, a8=S? Let's list:\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=0\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=1\n\nt=7: a7=S, y8=1  (stay)\n\nt=8: a8=S, y9=1  (stay)\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nBut at t=8, I did a8=S, y9=1, then t=9 a9=U, y10=2.\n\nAt t=9, I am on y9=1, which is safe, then I take a9=U to go to y10=2.\n\nI could have taken a8=U at t=8, but from y8=1, a8=U, y9=2, but at t=9, y9=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo must not do that.\n\nThus, I must stay at y=1 at t=8 and t=9 or move down, but moving down wastes time.\n\nSo staying is fine.\n\nTo save one action, but I have to stay at least from t=7 to t=9 at y=1 or something.\n\nFrom t=7 y=1 to t=9, if I stay both turns, I have two stays.\n\nBut I could move down to y=0 and up, but that takes more actions.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=1, a7=D, y8=0\n\nThen at t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a8=U, y9=1\n\nThen at t=9, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=2, etc.\n\nBut now I have one extra down and up, so to reach y=9, it will be later.\n\nFor example, t=5: S, y6=0\n\nt=6: U, y7=1\n\nt=7: D, y8=0\n\nt=8: U, y9=1\n\nt=9: U, y10=2\n\nt=10: U, y11=3\n\n...\n\nto t=17: y=8? Let's count.\n\nt=9 y=1, a9=U, t=10 y=2\n\nt=10 y=2, a10=U, t=11 y=3\n\nt=11 y=3, a11=U, t=12 y=4\n\nt=12 y=4, a12=U, t=13 y=5\n\nt=13 y=5, a13=U, t=14 y=6\n\nt=14 y=6, a14=U, t=15 y=7\n\nt=15 y=7, a15=U, t=16 y=8\n\nt=16 y=8, a16=U, t=17 y=9\n\nSame as before, reach at t=17.\n\nBut I used a D and extra actions? In this case, actions: a5=S, a6=U, a7=D, a8=U, a9=U, ..., to a16=U.\n\nCompared to first sequence: a5=S, a6=U, a7=S, a8=S, a9=U, ..., a16=U.\n\nIn first sequence, a7=S and a8=S, here a7=D and a8=U, so I have one D and one U instead of two S, but net same, and I reach at same time.\n\nBut in terms of number, same H=13.\n\nBut in the down-up, I might have collision risk, but at t=7 y=1, D to y=0, t=8 y=0, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut not better.\n\nSo min H is 13, reaching at t=17.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the first sequence, I stayed at y=1 for t=7 and t=8.\n\nBut at t=9, I stayed? In sequence: at t=8, y8=1, a8=S, so y9=1.\n\nThen a9=U to y10=2.\n\nI could go to y=2 at t=10, but I need to avoid t=9 for y=2-8, but at t=9 I am on y=1, safe.\n\nAfter t=9, all safe.\n\nNow, to write the action sequence for H=13.\n\nActions from a5 to a16.\n\nWe need to specify each action.\n\nIn the sequence, at the last turn, a16, we take action to stay or whatever, but since we reach y=9 at t=17, a16 can be S or U, but U would go to y=10, invalid, so must S or D, but D to y=8, not 9, so must S to stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need minimal H, which is 13.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=12.\n\nH=12, reach at t=5+12-1=16.\n\ny16=9.\n\nWith actions a5 to a15, 11 actions, net +9 with constraints.\n\nAs before, a5 must be S, y6=0.\n\nThen a6 to a15: 10 actions, net +9 to y16 from y6=0.\n\nBut with 10 actions, net +9, must be 9U and 1S.\n\nNow, y8 must be 0,1,9.\n\ny8: after a7, y8 = y6 + delta a6 + delta a7\n\ny6=0, a6 and a7, two actions.\n\ny8 <= 2, so y8=0,1, or 2, but y8 must be 0,1,9, so y8=0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, y9 <= y6 +3 =3, must be 0,1,9, so y9=0,1.\n\nIf y8=0, then from y8=0 to y16=9 need +9 in 8 actions (a8 to a15), max +8 with all U, cannot.\n\nIf y8=1, then to y16=9 need +8 in 8 actions, max +8, so must all U.\n\nBut we have one S in a6 to a15.\n\nIf y8=1, and we need all U from a8 to a15, but a8 to a15 are 8 actions, if all U, y16 = y8 +8 =1+8=9, good.\n\nBut we have one S in a6 to a15, which must be in a6 or a7, since a8 to a15 all U.\n\na6 to a15: 10 actions, with 9U and 1S.\n\nIf a8 to a15 all U, that is 8U, so S must be in a6 or a7.\n\nNow, y8=1.\n\ny8 = y6 + delta a6 + delta a7 =0 + delta a6 + delta a7\n\nIf both U, y8=2, but y8=2 not allowed.\n\nIf one U and one S, y8=1.\n\nIf both S, y8=0.\n\nBut y8=1 required.\n\nSo must have one U and one S in a6 and a7.\n\nEither a6=U, a7=S: y7=1, y8=1\n\nOr a6=S, a7=U: y7=0, y8=1\n\nNow, y8=1, good.\n\nThen a8 to a15 all U: y9=2, y10=3, ..., y16=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y9=2, which is on freeway y=2, and at t=9, unsafe, collision.\n\nBecause y=2 unsafe at t=9.\n\nThus, not possible.\n\nIf in the case a6=S, a7=U: y7=0, y8=1, then a8=U, y9=2, same, collision at t=9.\n\nThus, impossible for H=12.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, for the sequence, as before.\n\nWe can choose different actions, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=5: a5=S, stay at y=0\n\nt=6: a6=U, go to y=1 at t=7\n\nt=7: a7=S, stay at y=1 for t=8? At t=7, after a7, position at t=8 is y8.\n\nAt turn t=7, position y7=1, take a7=S, so y8=1.\n\nThen at t=8, position y8=1, take a8=S, so y9=1.\n\nThen at t=9, position y9=1, take a9=U, so y10=2.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nAt t=17, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a5 to a16.\n\na16 is U, but at y=8, U to y=9, fine.\n\nAt the end, when at y=9, we can S, but here we go up.\n\nIn the action sequence for t=16, a16=U to reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we already considered, only the first one matters, others not covering 0.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have no collision.\n\nAt t=6, y=0, not freeway.\n\nt=7, y=1, safe (t=7)\n\nt=8, y=1, safe\n\nt=9, y=1, safe\n\nt=10, y=2, safe (t=10>9)\n\netc.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=13.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: ? But actions up to a16 for H=13, since actions t=0 to 12, a5 to a16.\n\nAt turn 17, we don't have action, since we reached at turn 17.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at t=16.\n\nIn the box, we list from turn 5 to turn 5+H-1=5+12=17? H=13, t from 0 to 12, so turns 5 to 17? 5 to 5+12=17.\n\nBut turn 17: action a17, but a17 determines y18, not needed.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=13, actions at turn 5 to 5+12=17.\n\nBut at turn 17, we are at y=9, and we take action, but since we reached, we can take S.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 16, we are at y=8? t=16 position.\n\nIn my sequence: at turn 16, position y16=8 (after a15=U from y15=7)\n\nThen take a16=U, go to y17=9.\n\nThen at turn 17, position y17=9, take action, say a17=S.\n\nBut in the action sequence for H=13, it includes a17.\n\nWe can set a17=S.\n\nBut in the output, we need only up to the actions to reach, but the sequence includes H actions.\n\nTo be consistent.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, with H=13, actions a5 to a17.\n\nBut a17 is after reaching.\n\nBut we have to include.\n\nIn the position, at turn 17, y=9, we take a17, which can be S.\n\nIn the sequence I have a5 to a16, but for H=13, we need 13 actions, so include a17.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nH=13, actions at turn: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nAt turn 17, we take action a17.\n\nSince at turn 17, y=9, we can do S.\n\nIn the path, to reach at turn 17, we need y17=9, which is determined by previous actions.\n\nIn my earlier, with a5 to a16 as above, y17=9.\n\nThen a17 can be S.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S  (y6=0)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y7=1)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y8=1)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y9=1)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=2)\n\nTurn 10: U  (y11=3)\n\nTurn 11: U  (y12=4)\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=5)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=6)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y15=7)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y16=8)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y17=9)\n\nThen at turn 17: we need a17, say S, so y18=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 17, action S.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSince the player reaches at turn 17, and action at turn 17 is separate.\n\nBut in the output, we list all actions from turn 5 to turn 17.\n\nNow, to write.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at (0, 0) at turn 5, which is safe as \\(y = 0\\) has no freeway.\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turn 6 (due to car collision at \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns 8 and 9 (due to car collisions at \\(x = 0\\)).\n- All freeways are safe at all other turns.\n- The minimal \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 13, achieving position (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 5 + 13 - 1 = 17\\).\n- The sequence includes stays (S) to avoid unsafe freeways at critical turns:\n  - At turn 5, stay (S) to avoid being on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6.\n  - At turns 7 and 8, stay (S) on \\(y = 1\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 8 and 9.\n- After turn 9, all freeways are safe, allowing uninterrupted upward movement (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence for Minimal \\(H = 13\\):\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 = 5\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17\\) (13 turns).\n\n- **Turn 5**: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\), safe; avoids moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6)\n- **Turn 6**: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7; \\(y = 1\\) safe at turn 7)\n- **Turn 7**: S (stay at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 8; \\(y = 1\\) safe at turn 8)\n- **Turn 8**: S (stay at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 9; \\(y = 1\\) safe at turn 9)\n- **Turn 9**: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10; \\(y = 2\\) safe at turn 10)\n- **Turn 10**: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11; safe)\n- **Turn 11**: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12; safe)\n- **Turn 12**: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13; safe)\n- **Turn 13**: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14; safe)\n- **Turn 14**: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15; safe)\n- **Turn 15**: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16; safe)\n- **Turn 16**: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17; reach goal)\n- **Turn 17**: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\); action at turn 17 does not affect reaching the goal but is included in the sequence)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 6: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 7: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, not turn 6).\n- At turn 8: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, not turn 6).\n- At turn 9: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, not turn 6).\n- Turns 10–16: Moving through \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) after turn 9 (all safe).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive. Since we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, we'll need to move up mostly, but might need to wait or adjust to avoid cars.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: When you move to a new y at turn T, you are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and you only occupy y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=6. So at t=6, player is at y=0.\n\nI need to find actions from t=6 onwards, and H such that after H turns, at turn t=6 + (H-1), y = 9. Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position should be (0,9). But the position is updated after action, so let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is (0, y_t). Then action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at the next turn, t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T = 9. And T should be minimal.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from t_1, so for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H - 1, and after these H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at t_1 with y_{t_1} = 0, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nNow, cars: they are moving, and we need to check for each freeway we are on at each turn whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=6.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)] for T >=6.\n\nAt T=6, span = [-11 +12(0), 0 +12(0)] = [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=2: cars: one car, head -12, tail -23, right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\nAt T=6: [-23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway k=3: same as k=2? The table says:\n\n| 3 | (-12, -23, right, 6) | so head -12, tail -23, right, s=6, same as k=2.\n\nk=4,5,6 all same: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nThen k=7: three cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving cars, head is larger than tail? In the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head] with tail < head, I think.\n\nIn the car update: right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] and since it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, h > τ probably.\n\nIn k=1, at t1, h=0, τ=-11, so span [-11,0], so head is at 0, tail at -11, so the car is from -11 to 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor k=7: first car: head -12? Head is h, but in the list it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for the first car on k=7, it says (-12, -23, right, 6). So head = -12, tail = -23? But for right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger, but -12 > -23, yes, -12 is greater than -23.\n\n-12 is greater than -23, so head -12, tail -23, so the car spans from -23 to -12.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13? 24>13, so from 13 to 24.\n\nBut tail should be less than head for right-moving? In the notation, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the position where the front is, tail is the back, so head > tail if moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head < tail, but here all are right-moving except k=1 has direction right, all others are right.\n\nk=1 is right, all others right.\n\nIn k=7, first car: head=-12, tail=-23, so at t1=6, span from -23 to -12.\n\nSecond car: head=24, tail=13, span from 13 to 24.\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49, span from 49 to 60.\n\nSimilarly for k=8: same as k=7: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player starts at y=0 at t=6, and y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible when at y=0 or y=9, I assume, since y=9 is the goal, probably no cars there.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are 1 to 8, so only when on y=1 to 8, we need to worry about cars.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some point and then move up to y=9.\n\nBut at y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nNow, let's think about the car movements.\n\nFirst, for each freeway and each car, I need to know when 0 is in their span, because that's when if player is on that freeway, collision happens.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and for each turn T, we can find if there is a car such that 0 is in span at T.\n\nSince the span depends on T, we can find for each k, the times when it is dangerous to be on k, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car on k.\n\nThen for the player, at each turn, when on a freeway y_t, it must not be dangerous at that turn.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with k=1: one car, right-moving, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)] = [12(T-6) -11, 12(T-6)]\n\n0 is in span if 12(T-6) -11 <= 0 <= 12(T-6)\n\nWhich is 12(T-6) -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 12(T-6)\n\nFrom 0 <= 12(T-6), so T-6 >=0, T>=6\n\nFrom 12(T-6) -11 <=0, so 12(T-6) <=11, T-6 <= 11/12 <1, so T-6 <=0 since T integer, T-6 <=0, but T>=6, so only T=6.\n\nAt T=6, 12(0)-11 = -11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nFor T>6, 12(T-6) >=12>0, and 12(T-6) -11, for T=7, 12(1)-11=1>0, so [1,12], 0 not in it.\n\nSimilarly, only at T=6, 0 is covered on k=1.\n\nBut at T=6, player is at y=0, not on k=1, so no issue.\n\nNow k=2: one car, head=-12, tail=-23, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-23 + 6(T-6), -12 + 6(T-6)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6(T-6) <= 0 <= -12 +6(T-6)\n\nLeft: -23 +6(T-6) <=0 => 6(T-6) <=23 => T-6 <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so T-6 <=3\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +6(T-6) => 12 <=6(T-6) => 2 <= T-6 => T-6 >=2\n\nSo T-6 >=2 and T-6 <=3, so T=8 or T=9.\n\nT-6=2 or 3.\n\nAt T=8: span [-23+6(2), -12+6(2)] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], 0 in it.\n\nT=9: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in it? -5<=0<=6 yes.\n\nT=10: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=7: [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for k=2, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same car as k=2, so also dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nThe car is identical to k=2, so same times.\n\nk=4,5,6 all have the same car: (-12,-23,right,6), so each of these freeways has a car that covers 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow k=7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, s=6, right, same as above, so covers 0 at T=8,9.\n\nSecond car: head=24, tail=13, s=6, right, span at T: [13 +6(T-6), 24 +6(T-6)] = [6(T-6)+13, 6(T-6)+24]\n\n0 in span: 6(T-6)+13 <=0 <=6(T-6)+24\n\nLeft: 6(T-6)+13 <=0 => 6(T-6) <= -13 => T-6 <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so T-6 <= -3 since integer? T-6 <= -2.166, so T-6 <= -3? No.\n\n6(T-6) <= -13, since 6>0, T-6 <= -13/6 = -2.166, so T-6 <= -3? -2.166, so for integers, T-6 <= -3? Let's see:\n\nIf T-6 = -3, 6*(-3) = -18 <= -13, yes -18 <= -13.\n\nT-6 = -2, 6*(-2)= -12 > -13? -12 > -13, so -12 <= -13? No, -12 > -13, so 6(T-6) = -12 > -13, so inequality 6(T-6) <= -13 is false for T-6=-2.\n\nSimilarly, right inequality: 0 <= 6(T-6)+24, which is 6(T-6) >= -24, always true for T>=6.\n\nBut left: 6(T-6)+13 <=0\n\n6(T-6) <= -13\n\nT-6 <= floor(-13/6) = floor(-2.166) = -3? Since -13/6 = -2 -1/6, so T-6 <= -3? Let's compute:\n\nFor T-6 = -3: 6*(-3) +13 = -18+13= -5 <=0 true\n\nT-6 = -2: 6*(-2)+13= -12+13=1 >0, not <=0\n\nT-6 = -1: 6*(-1)+13=7>0\n\nT-6=0:13>0\n\nSo only when T-6 <= -3, but T-6 >=0? T>=6, so T-6 >=0, 6(T-6)+13 >=13>0, so never <=0 for T>=6. Thus, for this car, 0 is never in span for T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, the right part: 0 <= 6(T-6)+24 always true, but since left is never <=0, 0 is not in span.\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49, s=6, span [49+6(T-6), 60+6(T-6)]\n\n0 in span: 49+6(T-6) <=0 <=60+6(T-6)\n\nLeft: 49+6(T-6) <=0 => 6(T-6) <= -49 => T-6 <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so for T>=6, impossible.\n\nRight: 0 <=60+6(T-6) always true for T>=6.\n\nSo never 0 in span.\n\nThus for k=7, only the first car can cover 0, at T=8 and T=9, same as before.\n\nSimilarly for k=8: same cars as k=7, so also dangerous at T=8 and T=9 only from the first car.\n\nk=8 has the same three cars, so first car covers T=8,9.\n\nNow, for other freeways:\n\nk=1: dangerous only at T=6, but player not on it.\n\nk=2: dangerous T=8,9\n\nk=3: same T=8,9\n\nk=4: same T=8,9\n\nk=5: same T=8,9\n\nk=6: same T=8,9\n\nk=7: dangerous T=8,9\n\nk=8: dangerous T=8,9\n\nAnd for each, only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFor k=2 to 8, all have a car that covers 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nk=1 is different, but only at T=6.\n\nSo for freeways 1 to 8, the dangerous times are:\n\n- k=1: T=6\n\n- k=2 to 8: T=8 and T=9\n\nBut since k=1 only dangerous at T=6, and at T=6 player is at y=0, not on k=1, so effectively, for all freeways 1-8, they are safe except at T=8 and T=9, when all of them are dangerous.\n\nAt T=8 and T=9, for every freeway k=1 to 8, there is a car covering 0? k=1: at T=8, span was [12(8-6)-11, 12(2)] = [24-11,24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nk=1 only dangerous at T=6, not at T=8 or 9.\n\nk=2 to 6: each has a car covering 0 at T=8,9.\n\nk=7 and 8: first car covers at T=8,9.\n\nBut k=1 is safe at T=8,9.\n\nSo:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous only at T=6\n\n- Freeways 2,3,4,5,6: dangerous at T=8 and T=9\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=8 and T=9 (from first car)\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at T=8 and T=9 (from first car)\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe, meaning no car covers 0.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid being on a freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8 and T=9, we must not be on any freeway y=1 to 8, because all are dangerous except possibly y=1, but y=1 is dangerous only at T=6, not at T=8 or 9.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, dangerous only at T=6, so at T=8 and 9, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, at times other than T=8,9, they are safe.\n\nSo the critical points are turns T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on a freeway, we must not be on a dangerous one at that time.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=6, y=0.\n\nAction at t=6: we can go up to y=1, or stay at y=0, or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so only U or S.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, after action, position y_{7} = y_6 + Δy_6.\n\nNotation: at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t (before action), position y_t.\n\nAction a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nSince at turn t, we are on y_t for the whole turn, I think.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{t+1} at turn t, you are not on y_{t+1} at turn t, only on y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are always on y_t for collision check.\n\nNow, at t=6, y_t = y_6 = 0, not on freeway, so no collision possible, regardless of action.\n\nWe take action a_6, then y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=7, we are on y_7, and so on.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMinimal T: since from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves up, so T >= 6 + 9 = 15? Let's see.\n\nAt t=6, y_6=0.\n\nAfter first action a_6, y_7 = something.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_6 + H, y_{t_6 + H} = position.\n\nWe want y_{t_6 + H} =9, with minimal H.\n\nt_6 + H should be the turn when position is 9.\n\nSince start at t=6 y=0, after k up moves, y= k, at time t=6+k.\n\nSo to reach y=9, need at least 9 up moves, so at time t=15, y=9 if we go up every turn from t=6 to t=14.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions, y_15 =9.\n\nt=6: action, y_7\n\nt=7: action, y_8\n\n...\n\nt=14: action, y_15\n\nSo after 9 actions, y_15=9 if all U.\n\nBut we may need to wait or go down, so H might be more.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns are T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt turn T=8, if we are on y_8 between 1 and 8, it must not be dangerous, but at T=8, all freeways 2-8 are dangerous, only freeway 1 is safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, same thing.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 1 is safe, freeways 2-8 dangerous.\n\nAt T=9, same.\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe.\n\nSo to avoid collision, at turn 8 and turn 9, we must either be on y=0, y=9, or on freeway 1.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns, all positions are safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe can go up immediately.\n\nSuppose at t=6, we go up: a_6 = U, so y_7 = 1.\n\nNow at turn t=7, y_7=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nIs it dangerous? At t=7, for freeway 1, is 0 covered?\n\nEarlier for k=1, only dangerous at T=6, not at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, span for k=1: [12(7-6)-11, 12(1)] = [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo at t=7, y=1, safe.\n\nNow action at t=7: we can go up to y=2, or stay, or down to y=0.\n\nIf we go up, y_8=2.\n\nAt turn t=8, y_8=2.\n\nNow freeway y=2, at time t=8.\n\nFor freeway 2, dangerous at T=8? Yes, as we computed, at T=8, car covers 0.\n\nSo if y_8=2, and at t=8, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=1 at t=8.\n\nIf at t=7, we set a_7=S, then y_8 = y_7 =1.\n\nThen at turn t=8, y_8=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt t=8, freeway 1: span [12(2)-11, 12(2)] = [24-11,24] = [13,24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we are safe.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, at t=8, if we are at y=1, we can go up to y=2 at action a_8.\n\nBut at turn t=8, we are on y_8=1, safe.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8.\n\nIf we go up, y_9=2.\n\nThen at turn t=9, y_9=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt t=9, freeway 2 is dangerous, since covers 0.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=8, y_9=1, then at t=9, y_9=1, freeway 1, which at t=9 is safe: span [12(3)-11, 36] = [36-11,36]=[25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut we are at y=1, need to go up.\n\nThe problem is at t=8 and t=9, we need to be on y=0, y=9, or y=1.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but we are at y=0 or 1, far from 9.\n\ny=0 is safe but we need to move up.\n\nSo to avoid the danger, at t=8 and t=9, we should be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is far, and y=0 is start, we can be on y=1 at those times.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if we are at y=1, we can stay or move, but at the turn, we are on y_t.\n\nSo if at t=8 and t=9, y_t =1, then safe.\n\nThen after that, we can go up freely.\n\nNow, from start: t=6, y=0.\n\nWe can go to y=1 at t=6: a_6=U, y_7=1.\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=1, we need to set so that at t=8, y_8=1.\n\nSo at t=7, action a_7=S, so y_8=1.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=1, safe.\n\nNow at t=8, we are on y_8=1, take action a_8.\n\nWe want to stay at y=1 for t=9 as well, so at t=8, we can stay: a_8=S, so y_9=1.\n\nThen at t=9, y_9=1, safe.\n\nNow after t=9, no danger, all freeways safe.\n\nThen we can go up as fast as possible to y=9.\n\nAt t=9, y_9=1, after action.\n\nNow actions from t=9 onwards.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to go up 8 more times.\n\ny_9=1, we want y_T=9 for some T.\n\nAfter k up moves, y=1+k.\n\nSet 1+k=9, k=8.\n\nSo from t=9 to t=16, actions.\n\nt=9: action a_9, y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\ny_9=1, after a_9.\n\nIf a_9=U, y_10=2\n\na_9=S, y_10=1\n\netc.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up every turn.\n\nSo from t=9 to t=16: actions a_9 to a_16? Let's index.\n\nAt time t=9, position y_9=1.\n\nWe take actions at t=9, t=10, ..., up to when y=9.\n\nAfter first action a_9, y_10 =1 + Δy_9\n\nIf Δy_9=U, y_10=2\n\nThen a_10, y_11, and so on.\n\nAfter 8 up actions, y_{9+8} = y_17 =1+8=9.\n\nActions: at t=9, U, y_10=2\n\nt=10, U, y_11=3\n\n...\n\nt=15, U, y_16=8\n\nt=16, U, y_17=9\n\nSo at t=17, y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence: from t=6 to t=16, actions.\n\nt=6: U, y_7=1\n\nt=7: S, y_8=1\n\nt=8: S, y_9=1\n\nt=9: U, y_10=2\n\nt=10: U, y_11=3\n\nt=11: U, y_12=4\n\nt=12: U, y_13=5\n\nt=13: U, y_14=6\n\nt=14: U, y_15=7\n\nt=15: U, y_16=8\n\nt=16: U, y_17=9\n\nH = number of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=6, after H actions, up to t=6 + H -1, then y_{6 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from t=6 to t=16, that's 11 actions: t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nAfter 11 actions, y_{17} =9.\n\nt_1 + H = 6 + H, set to 17, so H=11.\n\nMinimal H? We could go faster?\n\nBut we had to stay at y=1 for t=7,8,9? In the above, at t=7 we stayed, t=8 stayed, so y_8=1, y_9=1.\n\nBut we reached y_9=1 at t=9, then from there to y=9 in 8 steps, to t=17.\n\nCould we be at higher y earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 at t=8 and t=9, but we started at y=0 t=6.\n\nAt t=6, if we don't move, a_6=S, y_7=0.\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=0, we can go to y=1, a_7=U, y_8=1.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=1, safe.\n\nNow at t=8, if we stay, a_8=S, y_9=1, safe at t=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=8, we go up to y=2, but then at t=9, y_9=2, which is dangerous, since freeway 2 at t=9 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must not be on y=2 to 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo we have to be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=9 not possible, y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf we are at y=0 at t=8.\n\nAt t=6, y=0.\n\na_6=S, y_7=0\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=0, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf at t=7, a_7=S, y_8=0.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action a_8.\n\nIf we go up, a_8=U, y_9=1.\n\nThen at t=9, y_9=1, which is safe? Freeway 1 at t=9 is safe, as span [25,36], no 0.\n\nSo y_9=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nBut now, at t=9, we are at y=1, same as before.\n\nIf at t=8, after y_8=0, we go up to y_9=1, same.\n\nBut we lost time at y=0.\n\nIn the first approach, we were at y=1 from t=7 onwards.\n\nIn the second, at t=7 y=0, t=8 y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut to reach higher faster, better to be at y=1 earlier.\n\nIn first sequence, with a_6=U, we have y_7=1 at t=7.\n\nThen we stay at t=7 and t=8 to be at y=1 for t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=9 we are at y=1, then go up.\n\nBut at t=9, we are at y=1, and we can go up immediately at t=9, to y=2 at t=10, etc.\n\nIn the sequence I had, at t=9 we go U to y=2.\n\nBut t=9 is past the danger, so ok.\n\nNow, can we avoid staying twice?\n\nFor example, at t=7, y_7=1, if we go up to y=2 at t=7, then y_8=2 at t=8, but then collision at t=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=6, if we stay, y_7=0, then at t=7, go to y=1, y_8=1, then at t=8, if we go up to y=2, y_9=2, then at t=9, y_9=2, collision.\n\nSo we must stay or be at safe position at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThe safe positions at t=8 and t=9 are y=0,1,9.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable, y=0 or 1.\n\nTo minimize time, better to be at y=1 at those times, so we can start going up earlier.\n\nIn the sequence above, with two stays at t=7 and t=8, we have H=11 actions to reach at t=17.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, it takes 8 up moves, from t=9 to t=16, y_17=9.\n\nt=9 to t=16 is 8 actions? t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 8 actions, y from 1 to 9.\n\nPlus before: from t=6 to t=8: three actions to get to and stay at y=1.\n\nt=6: U to y=1 (at t=7)\n\nt=7: S to stay y=1 (at t=8)\n\nt=8: S to stay y=1 (at t=9)\n\nThen t=9 to t=16: U each, to y_10=2, y_11=3, ..., y_17=9.\n\nSo actions from t=6 to t=16, 11 actions.\n\nNow, is there a way with less than 11?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=1 only at one of the critical turns.\n\nBut at both t=8 and t=9, we need to be safe.\n\nSuppose we are at y=1 at t=8, then at t=8 we go up to y=2, but then at t=9, y_9=2, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=0 at t=9.\n\nBut y=0 is below.\n\nFor instance, at t=7, suppose we are at y=1, instead of staying, we go down to y=0? But y=0, then at t=8, y_8=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can go to y=1, y_9=1, then at t=9, y_9=1, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at t=9, same as before, but we wasted a move going down and up.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=6, go up to y=1.\n\nt=7, go up to y=2? But at t=8, if y_8=2, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher than y=1 before t=8.\n\nBut from t=6, we can only be at y=0 or 1 at t=7.\n\nt=6: y_6=0, action a_6, y_7 =0 or 1.\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, then a_7, y_8=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=1, a_7, y_8=0,1,2.\n\nBut at t=8, must be y=0 or 1 to be safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, must be y=0 or 1.\n\nBut if at t=8 we are at y=1, and we go up to y=2 at t=8, then at t=9 y=2, collision.\n\nSo we must not go up during t=8 or t=9 if it would put us on dangerous y.\n\nThe only safe actions at t=8 and t=9 are to stay at y=0 or y=1, or go between them.\n\nBut since we need to go up eventually, better to stay at y=1.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before t=8, but impossible, since from t=6, min turns to y=9 is 9, to t=15, but t=15>t=9, so no.\n\nt=15 is after t=9.\n\nSo we must pass through the danger zone at t=8 and t=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: at t=8 and t=9, freeway 1 is safe, but are there other safe freeways? No, only y=1 is safe at those times, others dangerous.\n\nBut in our plan, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, in the sequence, when we go up from y=1 to y=2, etc., after t=9, all safe.\n\nBut let me list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn t | y_t (before action) | action a_t | y_{t+1}\n\nStart: t=6, y_6=0\n\na_6 = U, so y_7 = 0 + 1 =1\n\nt=7, y_7=1, a_7 = S, so y_8 =1 + 0 =1\n\nt=8, y_8=1, a_8 = S, so y_9 =1 + 0 =1\n\nt=9, y_9=1, a_9 = U, so y_10 =1 +1 =2\n\nt=10, y_10=2, a_10 = U, y_11=3\n\nt=11, y_11=3, a_11 = U, y_12=4\n\nt=12, y_12=4, a_12 = U, y_13=5\n\nt=13, y_13=5, a_13 = U, y_14=6\n\nt=14, y_14=6, a_14 = U, y_15=7\n\nt=15, y_15=7, a_15 = U, y_16=8\n\nt=16, y_16=8, a_16 = U, y_17=9\n\nNow, at each turn, collision check:\n\nt=6: y_6=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nt=7: y_7=1, freeway 1, at time t=7, as computed, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y_8=1, freeway 1, at t=8, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y_9=1, freeway 1, at t=9, span [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10: y_10=2, freeway 2, at t=10, for freeway 2, car span at t=10: [ -23 +6(10-6), -12 +6(4) ] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at t=10, since dangerous only at t=8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for t=11 to t=16, all safe, as no cars cover 0.\n\nt=16: y_16=8, freeway 8, at t=16, for k=8, cars: first car span at t=16: [ -23 +6(16-6), -12 +6(10) ] = [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [13+6(10), 24+60] = [13+60,24+60]= [73,84], no.\n\nThird: [49+60,60+60]=[109,120], no. So safe.\n\nThen after a_16=U, y_17=9, reached.\n\nNow, H=11 actions: from t=6 to t=16.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =16, so 6 + H -1 =16, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nMinimal? Suppose we can reach earlier by not staying.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=1 at t=8, and at t=8 we go up, but then y_9=2, which at t=9 is dangerous.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at t=9, impossible.\n\nOr at y=0 at t=9.\n\nBut y=0 is low.\n\nSuppose at t=6, U to y=1\n\nt=7, U to y=2? But at t=8, y_8=2, dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=6, S, y=0\n\nt=7, U, y=1\n\nt=8, S, y=1 (since if U, y=2 at t=9 dangerous)\n\nThen t=9, U to y=2, etc., same as before with one more stay at beginning but we moved later.\n\nIn this case: t=6: S, y_7=0\n\nt=7: U, y_8=1\n\nt=8: S, y_9=1\n\nThen t=9: U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nTo y_17=9, but now actions from t=6 to t=16 still, but we have a S at t=6 instead of U, so we start later, but same number of actions? t=6 action S, then t=7 to t=16: 10 actions? Let's count.\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: S\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\n...\n\nup to t=16: U to y_17=9\n\nActions: t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: 11 actions, same H.\n\nBut in this, at t=7, y_7=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nt=8, y_8=1, safe.\n\nt=9, y_9=1, safe.\n\nBut we reached y=1 later, so the up moves start later, but still finish at same time.\n\nIn first sequence, we have y=1 at t=7, here at t=8.\n\nBut since we have to stay at t=8 anyway, it doesn't save time.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to avoid, but that would take more time.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have to output actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nIn the first sequence: a_6=U, a_7=S, a_8=S, then U from a_9 to a_16.\n\na_16 is the last action.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we already covered that only the first one matters at t=8,9.\n\nIn the sequence, when going up, for example at t=10, y=2, freeway 2, at t=10, car span [1,12] as above, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIs there any other dangerous time? Earlier we have only t=8 and t=9 for k=2-8, and t=6 for k=1, but k=1 only at t=6.\n\nIn our sequence, we didn't encounter issues.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster after t=9.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, 8 up moves, 8 turns, to reach at t=17.\n\nIf we could be higher than y=1 at t=9, but we can't because of the danger.\n\nSuppose we are at y=0 at t=8, then at t=8 go up to y=1, y_9=1, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nFor turn t_1=6:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter a_16, y_17=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=16, 11 turns.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =6 to 6+H-1.\n\nSet 6+H-1=16, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer, it says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the car state, for k=7 and k=8, there are multiple cars, but we checked that only the first one affects, and at t=8,9 it covers 0.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at t=8, for k=7, first car span: at T=8, [ -23 +6(8-6), -12 +6(2) ] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nOther cars not cover.\n\nSimilarly for k=8.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence involves moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, staying at \\(y = 1\\) during turns 7 and 8 to avoid collisions (since freeways 2 to 8 are dangerous at turns 8 and 9, but freeway 1 is safe), and then moving up continuously from turn 9 to turn 16 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{6 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{10}\\) (for \\(t\\) from 0 to 10, corresponding to turns 6 to 16) is:\n\n- **Turn 6**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7)\n- **Turn 7**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 8)\n- **Turn 8**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 9)\n- **Turn 9**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10)\n- **Turn 10**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11)\n- **Turn 11**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12)\n- **Turn 12**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13)\n- **Turn 13**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14)\n- **Turn 14**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15)\n- **Turn 15**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16)\n- **Turn 16**: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17)\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Turns 6 and 7**: At turn 6, \\(y_6 = 0\\) (not a freeway, safe). At turn 7, \\(y_7 = 1\\) (freeway 1); car span at \\(T=7\\) is \\([1, 12]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turns 8 and 9**: At turn 8, \\(y_8 = 1\\) (freeway 1); car span at \\(T=8\\) is \\([13, 24]\\) (0 not in span, safe). At turn 9, \\(y_9 = 1\\) (freeway 1); car span at \\(T=9\\) is \\([25, 36]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turns 10 to 16**: For freeways 2 to 8, cars only cover 0 at turns 8 and 9. At later turns (e.g., \\(T=10\\) for freeway 2: span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span), all positions are safe. Moving up from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 8\\) avoids collisions.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{17} = 9\\) in 11 actions, which is minimal due to the need to avoid the dangerous turns 8 and 9 by staying on safe freeway 1 during those turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is vertical only.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and at that same turn, for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and on y' at turn T+1. So during the move (at turn T) the player is still on the starting row.\n\nGiven the car states:\n\nFor each freeway k (which corresponds to y=k) and for each car on that freeway, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1=7.\n\nWe need to compute the car spans at future turns T (>=7). The car moves with constant speed. The update:\n\n- Left-moving (d = left): Span(T) = [h - s*(T-7), tau - s*(T-7)]   [Note: in the problem, for left-moving the initial span is [h, tau] and then subtract s*(T-t1). But note the example: left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> Span(T)= [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, note that for a left-moving car, the head is at the rightmost? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), tau - s (T-t1)]\"\n  - Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut looking at the given data, all cars in the current state are right-moving. So we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but note the representation: the car is from tail to head? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the car occupies from tau to h (with tau <= h). Then at time T, it moves to [tau + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)].\n\nSo for a car on freeway k at turn T, we check if 0 is in [tau + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)].\n\nWe are at turn 7, and the player is at y=1. We need to go from y=1 to y=9, but note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars) because cars are only on freeways 1 to 8. However, the player starts at y=1 (which has a car) and must avoid collisions at every turn until reaching y=9.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at turn T, meaning that at turn T we are at y=9. We are not required to be on y=9 for multiple turns? Just at the last turn.\n\nWe can plan the moves: at each turn we choose an action (U, D, S). We start at turn 7 at y=1.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) such that at turn 7 + H - 1 we are at y=9. Note: the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if H=1, then we have one action at t1 (turn 7) and then at the same turn (turn 7) we would move? But note: the update is: at turn t, we apply action a_t and then we get y_{t+1}. So if we start at turn t1=7 at y7=1, then:\n\n- At turn 7: we apply a_7 -> then we get y8 = y7 + Delta y7.\n- Then at turn 8: we apply a_8 -> y9, and so on.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H-1} = 9. So the last action is applied at turn t1+H-2? Let me clarify:\n\n- Start: turn 7, position y7=1.\n- After H-1 actions (from turn 7 to turn 7+H-2), we have H-1 moves, and then at turn 7 + (H-1) we have the position after the last move? Actually, the state at turn t is before the action? But the problem states:\n\nWe are at turn t1 (7) at position (0, y7). Then we choose actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9).\n\nThe position update: after applying a_t at turn t, the new position y_{t+1} is used at turn t+1.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 7: start at y7=1, apply a7 -> y8 = y7 + Delta(a7)\nTurn 8: at y8, apply a8 -> y9, and so on.\n\nWe want to find the smallest H such that at turn t1 + H - 1 (i.e., the turn after the last action) we are at 9. But note: after H actions we will be at turn 7+H. However, the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n- t=0: a_{t1+0} = a7\n- t=1: a8\n- ...\n- t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{7+H-1}\n\nThen the last action is applied at turn 7+H-1, and then the new position is at turn 7+H. But we want to be at (0,9) at turn 7+H-1? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". That means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or after the action of turn t1+H-1?\n\nLet me read: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the state y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the problem states the update: after applying a_t at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. So:\n\n- At the start of turn t: position is y_t.\n- Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} for the start of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we start turn t1 (7) at y7=1. We want to be at y_{t1+H-1} = 9. So the position at the start of turn 7+H-1 is 9.\n\nHow many actions? We apply actions at turns: 7, 7+1, ..., 7+H-2. That's H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So we have:\n\n- t=0: turn 7\n- t=1: turn 8\n- ...\n- t=H-1: turn 7+H-1\n\nBut then the last action is applied at turn 7+H-1, which leads to y_{7+H}. So then the position at turn 7+H-1 is the one before the last action? And we want the position at turn 7+H-1 to be 9? That would mean we don't need to apply an action at turn 7+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, the problem says: we are to determine the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions. And then the answer format lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that leads to 9.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. But note: after H actions, we have advanced H turns in time? And the position at the beginning of turn t1+H is the result of the last action? \n\nBut the goal is: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). How did we get there? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. Therefore, the sequence of actions should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would update to y_{t1+H}. So then the position at the beginning of turn t1+H is 9. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at position y_{t1+H-1}. Then we apply an action a_{t1+H-1} to get y_{t1+H}. But we don't require anything about y_{t1+H}. We require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we do not need to apply an action at turn t1+H-1? Because we are already at the goal at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo the sequence of actions should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-2? That is, H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions at every turn until we are at the goal? And the last action is taken at the turn when we are at the goal? But that doesn't make sense because if we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn t, we don't need to take an action? \n\nI think the problem intends: we are at turn t1, and we take actions for H consecutive turns (so H actions) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). But then the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the problem statement again: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo if we have H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we get the position at turn t1+H. But we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would require that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which might move us away? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we stop when we are at 9? So the last action that we take is the one that brings us to 9? Then the position at turn t1+H (the next turn) is 9? And then the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" — that doesn't match.\n\nI think there might be a misalignment. Let me re-read the problem: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nIn the update: \n- At turn t1: we start at y_{t1} (which is given as 1). \n- We apply a_{t1} -> then we have y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta a_{t1}\n- Then at turn t1+1: we start at y_{t1+1}, apply a_{t1+1} -> y_{t1+2}, etc.\n\nWe want that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. How many actions have been taken? We have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. That's H-1 actions. But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nAlternatively, if we take H actions, then we would be at turn t1+H, and we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? But that doesn't require the last action? \n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the example: the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the position after that action is y_{t1+H}. But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nI think the problem might have intended: we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at 9. Then the minimal H is the number of actions? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nTo resolve, note that the player is at (0,1) at turn 7. We want to be at (0,9) at turn T (which is the beginning of turn T). How many turns does it take? The number of turns from turn 7 to turn T is T - 7. And we define H = T - 7? Then T = 7 + H. But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the position at turn t1+H-1 = 7+H-1 is 9. \n\nSo T = 7 + H - 1. Then H = T - 6. \n\nAlternatively, if we let H be the number of turns we wait (including the starting turn?) then at turn 7 we are at turn 0 of the journey? \n\nGiven the complexity, I will assume that the problem means: we start at turn t1=7, and we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then H = T - 7. But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions from turn 7 to turn T-1 (because at turn T we don't take an action? because we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn T). Then the number of actions is H (which is T-7). But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nThe problem says: sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} — that would be for turn 7 (t=0) to turn 7+H-1 (t=H-1). Then the position at the beginning of turn 7+H is the result of the last action? And we require that at the beginning of turn 7+H we are at 9? But then the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", which would be turn 7+H-1? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem again: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we want: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9. How many actions are required? The actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. So the number of actions is H-1. But the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nThis doesn't match. Therefore, I suspect that the problem intends H to be the number of actions. And then the turn at which we are at 9 is t1+H. Then we require y_{t1+H}=9. But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nGiven the provided example state, I will try to solve and see what makes sense.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck, I will assume that the problem means:\n\n- We start at turn t1 (7) at y=1.\n- We take actions at turns 7, 8, ..., up to some turn, and then at the beginning of turn T we are at y=9.\n- The number of turns we are playing is T - t1, and we take actions at every turn from t1 to T-1 (so T - t1 actions).\n- The problem says: minimal number of turns H. Then H = T - t1? And then the sequence is for turns from t1 to T-1 (which is H actions). And we require that at the beginning of turn T we are at 9, i.e., at turn t1+H we are at 9? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, if we set T = t1+H-1, then we require at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then the last action was taken at turn t1+H-2. Then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-2 (H-1 actions). But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nThis is a problem. \n\nGiven the answer format: it lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until turn t1+H-1. So H actions. Then the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. We require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? That would mean that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 which moves us to y_{t1+H} (which might not be 9). But that doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Probably, the intended meaning is that we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nHowever, note the collision rule: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the row at the beginning of turn T) and if there is a car on that freeway at turn T that has 0 in its span, then collision. \n\nSo we must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn T when a car on that row at turn T covers 0.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then at that turn, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem means: we want the player to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, and we have taken H actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the minimal H such that this happens. And then the answer lists the H actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis is the common interpretation. And then the turn when we are at 9 is t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nHowever, in the problem statement: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\nPerhaps \"turns\" here means the number of actions? But then it says \"turns\", and the current turn is given as t1=7, and then we have turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nGiven the time, I will solve for being at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 7+H, with H actions taken at turns 7 to 7+H-1. Then we require y_{7+H} = 9.\n\nThis is the typical setup. And then the minimal H such that we can achieve that without collisions.\n\nThen the answer will list actions for turn 7 to turn 7+H-1.\n\nIf the problem intended something else, then we might need to adjust.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cars.\n\nWe are at turn 7. We need to move from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 steps up. The minimal number of actions if there were no cars would be 8 (all U). But we have cars on the freeways.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row at a turn when a car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nLet's compute the car spans at future turns for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: (12, 1, right, 12) at turn 7.\nThis is a right-moving car. The span at turn 7 is [tau, h] = [1, 12]. But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)].\n\nSo at turn T, the car is at [1 + 12*(T-7), 12 + 12*(T-7)].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in that interval at any turn T when we are on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut note: freeway 1 has one car. Let's compute the span at a few turns:\n\nAt turn 7: [1, 12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe at turn 7? But we start at turn 7 at y=1. So we are on freeway 1 at turn 7. We must check if at turn 7, the car on freeway 1 has 0 in its span? The span is [1,12] at turn 7, and 0 is not in [1,12]. So safe.\n\nAt turn 8: [1+12, 12+12] = [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe at all turns after 7? Because the car is moving right and already at turn 7 the left end is 1, and it moves further right.\n\nBut what about other freeways? We have freeways 2 to 8.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-6, -17, right, 6). \nWait, the representation: for a right-moving car, the span at turn 7 is [tau, h] = [-17, -6]. Then at turn T: [-17 + 6*(T-7), -6 + 6*(T-7)].\n\nWe need to see if 0 is in this interval at some T.\n\nSolve: -17 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 <= -6 + 6*(T-7)\n\nLeft: -17 + 6*(T-7) <= 0 -> 6*(T-7) <= 17 -> T-7 <= 17/6 ≈ 2.83 -> T <= 9.83 -> so T=8,9,10? \n\nRight: 0 <= -6 + 6*(T-7) -> 6 <= 6*(T-7) -> 1 <= T-7 -> T>=8.\n\nSo for T>=8, the left condition: T-7<=ceil(17/6)=3, so T<=10.\n\nThus, 0 is in the car on freeway 2 at turns 8,9,10.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5,6 have the same car: (-6,-17,right,6). So they are unsafe at turns 8,9,10.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have three cars each. Let's take freeway 7:\n\nCar1: (-6, -17, right, 6) -> same as above: unsafe at turns 8,9,10.\n\nCar2: (30, 19, right, 6) -> wait, head=30, tail=19? But for a right-moving car, the span at turn 7 is [tau, h] = [19,30]? Then at turn T: [19+6*(T-7), 30+6*(T-7)]. When is 0 in this? \n19+6*(T-7) <= 0 <= 30+6*(T-7) -> \nBut 19+6*(T-7) >= 19 >0, so never.\n\nCar3: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> span at turn 7: [-59, -48] -> then at T: [-59+6*(T-7), -48+6*(T-7)].\n\nWe need: -59+6*(T-7) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-7)\n\nLeft: -59+6*(T-7) <=0 -> 6*(T-7) <=59 -> T-7<=59/6≈9.83 -> T<=16.83\n\nRight: 0<= -48+6*(T-7) -> 48<=6*(T-7) -> 8<=T-7 -> T>=15.\n\nSo for T from 15 to 16 (since T must be integer) -> T=15,16: \nAt T=15: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> contains 0? -11<=0<=0 -> yes.\nAt T=16: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9] = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> contains 0.\n\nSo freeway 7 has:\n- Car1: unsafe at T=8,9,10\n- Car2: always safe\n- Car3: unsafe at T=15,16\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same three cars? So same unsafe times.\n\nNow, we want to move from y=1 at turn 7 to y=9 at turn 7+H (beginning of turn 7+H).\n\nWe start at turn 7 at y=1. We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nThe minimal number of moves is 8 (if we go straight up). But we have to avoid the unsafe times for each row.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway row:\n\nRow 1: safe at all turns? (as computed above) -> we can be at row 1 at any turn.\n\nRow 2: unsafe at turns 8,9,10. So we cannot be at row 2 at turns 8,9,10.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2: unsafe at turns 8,9,10.\n\nRow 4: same.\n\nRow 5: same.\n\nRow 6: same.\n\nRow 7: unsafe at turns 8,9,10 (from car1) and also at turns 15,16 (from car3).\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nWe start at turn 7 at row 1. We can stay, go up, or down. But down to 0 is safe (but we need to go up eventually). \n\nThe goal is row 9, which is safe.\n\nWe need to plan a path that avoids being on a row at an unsafe turn.\n\nWe can use a BFS in state (turn, y) and we start at (7,1). We want to reach (T,9) for some T, and minimize T-7 (which is H).\n\nBut note: the state space is infinite in time? But we can bound: minimal H is 8, but we might have to wait. Since the unsafe times are only up to 16, we can consider up to turn 20 or so.\n\nWe'll simulate turns.\n\nWe are at turn 7: y=1. We are safe at turn 7 on row 1.\n\nNow, we can choose:\n- U: then at turn 8, y=2. But row 2 at turn 8 is unsafe! -> collision.\n- D: then at turn 8, y=0 -> safe (no freeway at y=0).\n- S: then at turn 8, y=1 -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 7, we cannot go up immediately because then at turn 8 we would be on row 2 (unsafe).\n\nOptions: \nOption 1: at turn 7, go down to y=0 at turn 8.\nOption 2: at turn 7, stay at y=1 at turn 8.\n\nBut if we stay at y=1 at turn 8, then at turn 8 we are safe? Row 1: at turn 8, the car on row1 is at [1+12, 12+12]=[13,24] -> safe. So we can stay.\n\nThen at turn 8, at y=1: then we can choose U, D, S.\n\nBut if we go up at turn 8, then at turn 9 we are at y=2. But row2 at turn9 is unsafe (because of the car: at turn9, the car on row2: [-17+6*(9-7), -6+6*(9-7)] = [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6] -> contains 0 -> unsafe). So we cannot be at row2 at turn9.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up at turn8 to y=2 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at row2 at turn9.\n\nWhat if we wait at y=1 for more turns? At turn8 we are at y=1 (safe). Then at turn8, we can choose to go down? to y=0 at turn9. Or stay at y=1 at turn9. Or go up? which we saw leads to unsafe.\n\nBut if we go up at turn8: y8=1 -> a8=U -> y9=2, and then at turn9 we are at row2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we avoid that.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at turn9: then safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=0. We need to go up eventually.\n\nAt turn9, we are at y=0. Then we can go up to y=1 at turn10.\n\nBut row1 at turn10: safe? car on row1: at turn10: [1+12*3, 12+12*3]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nAnd row2 at turn10: is it safe? The car on row2: at turn10: [-17+6*3, -6+6*3] = [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12] -> does it contain 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe! \n\nSo at turn10, row2 is safe.\n\nTherefore, one plan:\n\nTurn7: S -> then at turn8: y=1\nTurn8: D -> then at turn9: y=0\nTurn9: U -> then at turn10: y=1\nTurn10: U -> then at turn11: y=2 -> at turn11, row2: car on row2 at turn11: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4]=[-17+24, -6+24]=[7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18]).\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9. How many moves? We are at turn11 at y=2. We need to go to y=9: 7 moves. But we have to check the upper rows.\n\nAt row3: unsafe at turns 8,9,10. But at turn11 and after, safe? \nFor row3: same car as row2: unsafe at turns 8,9,10. At turn11: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4]=[7,18] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 4,5,6: same -> safe after turn10.\n\nNow row7: unsafe at turns 8,9,10 (from car1) and 15,16 (from car3). So at turn11 to 14: safe? \nAt turn11: car1 on row7: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4]=[7,18] -> safe.\nCar3: at turn11: [-59+6*4, -48+6*4]=[-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nSo row7 is safe from turn11 to 14.\n\nSimilarly, row8: same.\n\nBut we have to avoid row7 and 8 at turns 15,16.\n\nNow, from y=2 at turn11, we can go up continuously: \nturn11: U -> y3 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y4 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y5 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y6 at turn15\nBut at turn15, if we go to y6, then we are at y6 at turn15: row6 is safe (only unsafe at 8,9,10) so safe.\nBut then at turn15, we are at y6. Then we want to go to y7: but at turn15, row7 is unsafe (because of car3: at turn15, car3: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8]=[-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> contains 0 -> unsafe). So we cannot be at row7 at turn15.\n\nTherefore, at turn15, we must not be at row7.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at row8 at turn15 or 16.\n\nSo if we try to go up at turn14 to y6 at turn15, then at turn15 we are at y6. Then we can go up to y7 at turn16. But row7 at turn16: car3: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9]=[-59+54, -48+54]=[-5,6] -> contains 0 -> unsafe. So we cannot be at row7 at turn16 either.\n\nSo we must avoid row7 at turns 15 and 16.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on row7 at turn15 or turn16.\n\nSimilarly for row8.\n\nSo we need to time the passage through row7 and 8 outside of turns 15,16.\n\nWe are at y6 at turn15 (if we go straight up from turn11 to turn15: 4 moves: from y2 to y6). Then at turn15, we are at y6. We can wait at y6? But row6 is safe at turn15. Then at turn15, we can choose to stay at y6 for one turn? Then at turn16, we are still at y6. Then at turn16, we can go up to y7? but then at turn17, we are at y7. But row7 at turn17: \ncar3: at turn17: [-59+6*10, -48+6*10]=[-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\nSo then we can go.\n\nSo plan:\n\nAt turn15: at y6, we do S (stay) -> then at turn16, y6 (safe)\nAt turn16: U -> then at turn17, y7 (safe, because row7 at turn17: safe as above)\nThen at turn17: U -> y8 at turn18\nAt turn18: U -> y9 at turn19.\n\nBut we started at turn7. We are at turn19 at y9. So H = turn19 - 7 = 12. But we took 12 actions? From turn7 to turn18: 12 actions? Then the position at turn19 is y9.\n\nBut we can try to be faster.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid the wait at y6 by going faster earlier? But we were delayed at the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: from the start, instead of going down to 0, we could wait at y=1 for more turns? Then go up later.\n\nFor example, at turn7: S -> y1 at turn8 (safe)\nturn8: S -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: S -> y1 at turn10 (safe)\nturn10: U -> y2 at turn11 (safe, as row2 at turn11: [7,18] safe)\nthen we can go up continuously.\n\nFrom turn10 at y1, we go U at turn10: y2 at turn11\nturn11: U: y3 at turn12\nturn12: U: y4 at turn13\nturn13: U: y5 at turn14\nturn14: U: y6 at turn15\nturn15: U: y7 at turn16 -> but row7 at turn16 is unsafe? car3: [-5,6] contains 0 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go to y7 at turn16.\n\nAt turn15: we are at y6. Then we can stay at y6 at turn15 (S) -> then at turn16, y6. Then at turn16: U -> y7 at turn17 (safe, because row7 at turn17: [1,12] safe).\n\nThen turn17: U -> y8 at turn18\nturn18: U -> y9 at turn19.\n\nSame as before: 12 actions? But we started at turn7, and we have actions from turn7 to turn18 (12 actions) and then at turn19 we are at y9.\n\nBut we spent 3 turns (7,8,9) at y1, then 1 turn to go to y2 (turn10), then 5 turns to go from y2 to y7 (turns11 to15) but then we had to wait at y6 for one turn (turn15) and then move to y7 at turn17, then to y8 at turn18, y9 at turn19.\n\nTotal actions: turns 7 to 18: 12 actions.\n\nBut we can try to go down to 0 and then come back? \n\nEarlier I had a plan that went down at turn8 and then came back at turn10. That plan:\n\nturn7: S -> y1 at turn8\nturn8: D -> y0 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y1 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y2 at turn11\nthen same as above: \nturn11: U -> y3 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y4 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y5 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y6 at turn15\nturn15: S (wait) -> y6 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y7 at turn17\nturn17: U -> y8 at turn18\nturn18: U -> y9 at turn19\n\nAlso 12 actions.\n\nBut we can try to avoid the wait at y6 by going slower in the lower rows? For example, if we can be at y6 after turn15, then we are safe to wait, but if we can be at y6 at turn16, then we don't need to wait? \n\nHow? We started at turn7 at y1. We need to be at y6 as late as possible? But we have to avoid row7 at turn15 and 16.\n\nWe want to be at y7 at turn17 (safe) or later. So we can be at y6 at turn16? \n\nLet's see the timeline:\n\nWe want to be at y6 at turn16. Then at turn16 we go up to y7 at turn17 (safe).\n\nHow to get to y6 at turn16?\n\nFrom the start, we have to make 5 net up moves (from y1 to y6) and we can have some down moves and stays.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the unsafe times for rows 2-6: they are unsafe only at turns 8,9,10. So we must not be on rows 2-6 at turns 8,9,10.\n\nSo we must be either at y0, y1, or above y6? But we start at y1 and we are going up.\n\nWe have to spend turns 8,9,10 at safe rows: either y0 or y1.\n\nSo we must be at y1 (or y0) at turns 8,9,10.\n\nAt turn7: y1 -> we can choose to stay at y1 for turns 8,9,10? Or go down to y0 for some of them.\n\nOption: \nturn7: S -> turn8: y1\nturn8: S -> turn9: y1\nturn9: S -> turn10: y1\nthen at turn10: U -> turn11: y2\n\nThen we have to go from y2 at turn11 to y6 by turn16? We have 5 moves (from turn11 to turn15) to make 4 net up moves? Because from y2 to y6 is 4 steps. So we can do it in 4 moves: \nturn11: U -> y3 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y4 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y5 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y6 at turn15\nBut then at turn15, we are at y6. Then we can go up to y7 at turn16? But we don't want to be at y7 at turn16 (unsafe). So we have to wait at y6 at turn15? But then we are at y6 at turn15 (safe) and then at turn15 we do S: stay at y6 at turn16? Then at turn16 we go up to y7 at turn17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, we can add a down move to delay? But that might not help.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\nAt turn10: at y1, we do not go up immediately? We can stay at turn10: y1 -> then at turn11, y1. Then we are behind.\n\nOr we can go down? But that would be worse.\n\nSo minimal seems 12 actions? But we might be able to do better.\n\nAnother idea: go up at a later time. But we need to get to y9.\n\nOr use the fact that row1 is safe for a long time? But we already waited.\n\nWhat if we go up at turn7 to y2 at turn8? But that is unsafe (because row2 at turn8 is unsafe). So no.\n\nOr go down to y0 at turn8? Then at turn8: y0. Then at turn8, we can go up to y1 at turn9? But row1 at turn9: safe? car: [1+12*2, 12+12*2]=[25,36] -> safe. Then at turn9: we are at y1. But row2 at turn9 is unsafe, so we cannot go up at turn9. We can stay at y1 at turn9? Or go down to y0 again.\n\nBut if we go down at turn9: to y0 at turn10. Then at turn10: from y0, we can go up to y1 at turn11 (safe) and then proceed as before.\n\nBut then we have:\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: D -> y0 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y1 at turn11\nthen same: turn11: U -> y2 at turn12, ... until y6 at turn16? \n\nHow?\n\nturn11: y1 -> U: y2 at turn12\nturn12: U: y3 at turn13\nturn13: U: y4 at turn14\nturn14: U: y5 at turn15\nturn15: U: y6 at turn16 -> then at turn16, we are at y6 (safe) and then we can go up to y7 at turn17 (safe), then y8 at turn18, y9 at turn19.\n\nBut we have spent more moves: we did two down moves (at turn7 and turn9) and two up moves (turn8 and turn10) to no net progress. Then we have to go up 8 times? So total moves: from turn7 to turn18: 12 actions again.\n\nBut we have an extra down and up? It's the same as waiting.\n\nIs there a way to get past row7 without waiting? Only if we can be at row7 at a safe turn. The safe turns for row7 are turns 7, and 11,12,13,14,17,18,... (avoiding 8,9,10,15,16).\n\nWe start at turn7 at y1, so we cannot be at row7 at turn7.\n\nWe can try to be at row7 at turn11,12,13,14, or 17+.\n\nIf we are at row7 at turn11: then we would have to be at row7 at the beginning of turn11. How to get there? We start at y1 at turn7. We need to go up 6 steps (to y7) in 4 moves (from turn7 to turn10) but we have to avoid rows 2-6 at turns 8,9,10. \n\nAt turn8: we cannot be on rows 2-6. So we must be at y0 or y1 at turn8. Similarly for turn9,10.\n\nBut to be at y7 at turn11, we need to be at y7 at the start of turn11. The actions:\n\nturn7: action -> y at turn8\nturn8: action -> y at turn9\nturn9: action -> y at turn10\nturn10: action -> y at turn11.\n\nWe start at turn7 at y1. We want y11=7.\n\nNet change: +6.\n\nWe can do it in 4 moves if we do 6 up moves? But we have only 4 moves. And we can't go up more than one per move. So impossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be at row7 at turn12: then we need 6 net up moves in 5 moves. So one extra move: we can have one stay or down. But we have to avoid rows 2-6 at turns 8,9,10.\n\nThe moves from turn7 to turn11 (which set the position at turn12) are 5 moves.\n\nWe start at y1 at turn7. After 5 moves, we want y12=7? But the position at turn12 is the result of the 5th move (at turn11). So we want the position at turn12 to be 7.\n\nWe need to go from y1 to y7 in 5 moves: net +6, so we need 6 up moves and one down move? But we have only 5 moves. So net up moves = (number of U) - (number of D). We can have 6 U and 1 D? Then total moves 7, but we only have 5 moves. So impossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be at row7 at turn13: we have 6 moves (turns7 to 12) to go from y1 to y7: net +6. We can do 6 up moves and 0 down moves? Then 6 moves. But we have 6 moves: turns7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut we must avoid rows 2-6 at turns8,9,10.\n\nAt turn8: must be at y0 or y1.\nAt turn9: y0 or y1.\nAt turn10: y0 or y1.\n\nHow can we go from y1 to y7 in 6 moves while being at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10? \n\nAt turn7: start at y1.\nturn7: U -> y2 at turn8 -> but row2 at turn8 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8 (safe)\nturn8: from y0: U -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10 -> unsafe (row2 at turn10 is safe? wait: row2 at turn10: car: [1,12] -> contains 0? 0 is in [1,12]? 0 is not in [1,12] because 1>0? [1,12] is integers? The problem doesn't specify, but typically we consider continuous or discrete? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", and the span is a continuous interval? Or discrete? The grid is discrete in y, but x is continuous? Or both discrete? \n\nThe problem says: \"on a 2D grid (vertical axis y=0,1,...,9)\" but horizontal? The cars have integer head and tail? And the update is with speed (integer) so the positions are integers? \n\nBut the car spans are given as intervals of integers? Or real intervals? The collision condition: 0 in the span. If the span is [a,b] with a and b integers, then 0 is in [a,b] if a<=0<=b.\n\nFor row2 at turn10: car: [-17+6*3, -6+6*3] = [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12]. Is 0 in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1, so no. So safe? \n\nBut at turn10, row2 is safe? Then we can be at row2 at turn10.\n\nBut earlier I thought row2 at turn10: [1,12] and 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can do:\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8 (safe)\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10 (safe, because at turn10 row2 is safe)\nthen we need to go from y2 at turn10 to y7 at turn13? That is 5 moves: turns10,11,12,13? But we have to get to y7 at the beginning of turn13? \n\nThe moves:\n\nAt turn10: we are at y2 (beginning of turn10). Then we apply an action at turn10 -> y at turn11.\nWe want at the beginning of turn13: y13=7.\n\nSo we have three actions: turn10, turn11, turn12.\n\nFrom y2 to y7: need +5. But we can only do at most 3 up moves -> only +3. So we can only get to y5 at turn13.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWe need to be at row7 at turn14: then we have 7 moves (turns7 to 13) to go from y1 to y7: net +6.\n\nWe can do it in 6 moves: 6 up moves and one extra move that is down or stay. But we have to be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n\nLet me try:\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8 (safe)\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10 (safe, as row2 at turn10 is safe)\nThen we need to go from y2 at turn10 to y7 at turn14: that's 4 moves (turns10,11,12,13) -> net +5 required. We can do 4 up moves: y2->y3 at turn11, y4 at turn12, y5 at turn13, y6 at turn14. Then we are at y6 at turn14, not y7.\n\nTo get to y7 at turn14, we need to be at y7 at the beginning of turn14. The action at turn13 would set y14. So we need to be at y6 at the beginning of turn13 and then do U at turn13 to get y7 at turn14.\n\nBut then we are at y7 at turn14, which is safe? Because row7 is safe at turn14? \ncar3 at turn14: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> doesn't contain 0 -> safe.\ncar1: at turn14: [-17+6*7, -6+6*7] = [-17+42, -6+42] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo row7 at turn14 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can be at y7 at turn14.\n\nHow to get to y6 at turn13? \n\nFrom the start:\n\nWe need at turn13: y13=6? Then at turn13: U -> y14=7.\n\nWe start at y1 at turn7.\n\nWe have moves at turns7,8,9,10,11,12 (6 moves) to get from y1 to y6: net +5.\n\nWe can do 5 up moves and one down move? But we have to be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n\nPlan:\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10  (safe, row2 at turn10: [1,12] -> safe)\nturn10: U -> y3 at turn11 (row3 at turn11: [7,18] -> safe)\nturn11: U -> y4 at turn12 (row4 at turn12: same car? [7+6,18+6]? wait, no: for row4, the car is the same: (-6,-17,right,6) -> at turn12: [-17+6*5, -6+6*5]=[-17+30, -6+30]=[13,24] -> safe)\nturn12: U -> y5 at turn13 -> then we are at y5 at turn13, not y6.\n\nWe need to be at y6 at turn13. So we need one more up move.\n\nWe have only 6 moves and we did 5 up moves? But we started at y1 and went down once and then up 5 times: net +4, so y5.\n\nTo get net +5, we need to do 6 up moves and one down move? But then we have 7 moves, but we only have 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, without the down move at the beginning.\n\nturn7: U -> but then at turn8 y2: unsafe (row2 at turn8: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nturn7: S -> y1 at turn8\nturn8: S -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: S -> y1 at turn10\nthen at turn10: U -> y2 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y3 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y4 at turn13 -> then we are at y4 at turn13, need to be at y6 at turn13? no.\n\nWe need to be at y6 at turn13: so we must have done 5 up moves in the 6 moves, but we spent the first 3 moves (turns7,8,9) at y1 (so 3 stays) and then 3 up moves (turns10,11,12) to y4 at turn13. Then we are at y4, not y6.\n\nTo get to y6, we would need two more up moves, but we have no more moves in the 6.\n\nSo we cannot get to y6 at turn13 in 6 moves while avoiding the unsafe turns.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y7 is at turn17? In the first plan.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y7 at turn14? We need to get from y1 at turn7 to y7 at turn14: net +6 in 7 moves (turns7 to 13).\n\nWe can do 6 up moves and 1 down or stay. But we have to avoid rows 2-6 at turns8,9,10.\n\nOption:\n\nturn7: D -> y0 at turn8 (safe)\nturn8: U -> y1 at turn9 (safe)\nturn9: U -> y2 at turn10 (safe, row2 at turn10: [1,12] -> safe)\nturn10: U -> y3 at turn11 (safe)\nturn11: U -> y4 at turn12 (safe)\nturn12: U -> y5 at turn13 (safe)\nturn13: U -> y6 at turn14  -> then at turn14, we are at y6. Then at turn13, we did U to get y6 at turn14. But we wanted to be at y7 at turn14? Then we would need to be at y6 at turn13 and then do U at turn13 to get y7 at turn14. But at turn13, we are at y5? Then we did U at turn13: y6 at turn14.\n\nSo we are at y6 at turn14, not y7.\n\nTo be at y7 at turn14, we need to be at y6 at turn13 and then do U at turn13.\n\nSo we need to be at y6 at turn13.\n\nWith 6 moves (turns7 to 12) to go from y1 to y6: net +5.\n\nWe can do 5 up moves and 1 down move? But then net +4. Or 6 up moves and 1 down move? Then net +5, but we have 7 moves? We have only 6 moves.\n\nLet me count the moves to be at y6 at turn13:\n\nStart: turn7: y1\nAfter 6 actions (at turns7,8,9,10,11,12), we get y13.\n\nWe want y13=6.\n\nNet change: +5.\n\nWe can have: 5 up and 1 down? Then net +4, not enough.\nOr 6 up and 1 down? Then net +5, but we have to do 7 actions? Only 6 actions.\n\nOr 5 up and 1 stay? Then net +5. That works. So actions: 5 U and 1 S.\n\nWe have to distribute these while being at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n\nThe only way to be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10 is to spend those turns at y0 or y1.\n\nSo:\n\n turn7: we start at y1. We can do:\n  option1: turn7: D -> y0 at turn8\n  turn8: we can do U or S or D. \n    if U: y1 at turn9\n    turn9: then we can do U -> y2 at turn10 -> but then at turn10 we are at y2, which is safe? (row2 at turn10: [1,12] -> safe) -> allowed.\n    then we have moves turn10,11,12 to do 4 up moves? but we only have 3 moves. And we are at y2 at turn10, we need to get to y6 at turn13: 4 net up moves. We can do 3 up moves: to y5 at turn13.\n\n  option2: turn7: D -> y0 at turn8\n  turn8: S -> y0 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y1 at turn10\n  then at turn10: y1. Then turns10,11,12: we can do 3 up moves: to y4 at turn13. Not enough.\n\n  option3: turn7: S -> y1 at turn8\n  turn8: D -> y0 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y1 at turn10\n  then at turn10: y1. Then turns10,11,12: 3 up moves -> y4 at turn13.\n\n  option4: turn7: S -> y1 at turn8\n  turn8: S -> y1 at turn9\n  turn9: S -> y1 at turn10\n  then turns10,11,12: 3 up moves -> y4 at turn13.\n\nNone get us to y6 at turn13.\n\nSo it seems we cannot achieve that.\n\nTherefore, the best is to be at y6 at turn15 or turn16 and then proceed.\n\nAnd the total actions are 12.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the first plan:\n\nPlan A:\n- turn7: S  -> y1 at turn8\n- turn8: S  -> y1 at turn9\n- turn9: S  -> y1 at turn10\n- turn10: U -> y2 at turn11\n- turn11: U -> y3 at turn12\n- turn12: U -> y4 at turn13\n- turn13: U -> y5 at turn14\n- turn14: U -> y6 at turn15\n- turn15: S  -> y6 at turn16  (wait to avoid row7 at turn15 and 16)\n- turn16: U -> y7 at turn17\n- turn17: U -> y8 at turn18\n- turn18: U -> y9 at turn19\n\nThis is 12 actions: turns7 to turn18.\n\nThen at turn19, we are at y9.\n\nH = 12.\n\nBut the problem might expect a sequence without the explicit wait? But we have to.\n\nAnother plan: instead of waiting at y6, could we go down to y5 at turn15 and then come back? But that would take more moves.\n\nOr could we go from y6 to y7 at turn17 without waiting? Only if we are at y6 at turn16, then U at turn16 to y7 at turn17. But how to be at y6 at turn16? We would be one turn later.\n\nFor example, start as before but add one more stay at the beginning:\n\nturn7: S -> y1 at turn8\nturn8: S -> y1 at turn9\nturn9: S -> y1 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y2 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y3 at turn12\nturn12: U -> y4 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y5 at turn14\nturn14: S -> y5 at turn15  (stay at y5)\nturn15: U -> y6 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y7 at turn17\nturn17: U -> y8 at turn18\nturn18: U -> y9 at turn19\n\nStill 12 actions.\n\nBut at turn14 we did a stay, then we are at y5 at turn15 (row5 at turn15: safe, because row5's car: at turn15: [-17+6*8, -6+6*8]=[-17+48, -6+48]=[31,42] -> safe), then at turn15: U -> y6 at turn16 (safe), then U at turn16: y7 at turn17 (safe).\n\nSame number.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 11 actions? That would mean we reach y9 at turn18.\n\nSo we need to be at y9 at turn18, which means we were at y8 at turn17 and did U at turn17.\n\nWe need to be at y8 at turn17. But row8 at turn17: is it safe? \nFor row8: the cars are the same as row7: \ncar1: at turn17: [-17+6*10, -6+6*10]=[-17+60, -6+60]=[43,54] -> safe.\ncar2: [19+6*10, 30+6*10]=[79,90] -> safe.\ncar3: [-59+6*10, -48+6*10]=[1,12] -> contains 0 -> unsafe!\n\nOh! So row8 at turn17 has car3 with span [1,12] -> contains 0 -> unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at row8 at turn17.\n\nSimilarly, at turn18: \ncar3 at row8: at turn18: [-59+6*11, -48+6*11]=[-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18]).\n\nSo we can be at row8 at turn18.\n\nTherefore, we must be at row8 at turn18 or later.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y8 at turn18 (safe) and then at turn18 we do U to go to y9 at turn19.\n\nIf we want to be at y9 at turn18, that means at turn17 we are at y8 and do U at turn17 to have y18=9. But we cannot be at y8 at turn17 (unsafe).\n\nTherefore, we must be at y8 at turn18 (safe) and then do U at turn18 to get y19=9. Or we can be at y8 at turn18 and then at turn18 we are already at the goal? But we want y18=9? \n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. In our interpretation, we are at turn7+12 = turn19 at y9. But the problem says at turn t1+H-1 = 7+12-1=18.\n\nThis is the conflict.\n\nGiven the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", then we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn 7+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y9 at turn19, which would be t1+H if H=12, then turn7+12=19. But we want turn7+H-1=18.\n\nSo we need to be at y9 at turn18.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWe need to be at y9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\nThat means we were at y8 or y9 or y10 at turn17, and then the action at turn17 brought us to y9 at turn18.\n\nBut:\n- If we are at y8 at turn17, then U at turn17 -> y9 at turn18.\n- If at y9 at turn17, then S or U or D could keep it or change, but we want y9 at turn18, so we can do S.\n- If at y10 at turn17, then D -> y9 at turn18.\n\nBut we cannot be at y8 at turn17 because it's unsafe.\n\nWe can try to be at y9 at turn17? But then we are at y9 at turn17, and we can do S at turn17 to stay at y9 at turn18.\n\nBut how to be at y9 at turn17?\n\nFrom the start, in 10 moves (actions at turns7 to 16) to get to y9 at turn17.\n\nNet change: from y1 to y9: +8.\n\nWe have 10 moves: turns7 to 16: 10 actions.\n\nWe can do 8 up moves and 2 down or stays.\n\nBut we have to avoid rows 2-8 at unsafe turns.\n\nUnsafe times for rows:\n- Rows 2-6: turns8,9,10 -> must be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n- Row7: turns8,9,10,15,16 -> must avoid at these turns.\n- Row8: turns8,9,10,15,16.\n\nWe want to be at y9 at turn17, which is safe.\n\nHow to get there in 10 moves while respecting the constraints.\n\nThe moves:\n\n turns7,8,9,10: must be at y0 or y1.\n\nThen turns11 to 16: 6 moves to go from at most y1 to y9: net +8. Impossible because 6 moves can give at most +6.\n\nIf we are at y1 at turn10, then we need 8 up moves in 6 moves: impossible.\n\nIf we are at y0 at turn10, then we need 9 up moves in 6 moves: impossible.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y9 at turn17.\n\nThe next best is turn18.\n\nWe want to be at y9 at turn18.\n\nSo we need to be at y8 or y9 or y10 at turn17.\n\nBut we cannot be at y8 at turn17 (unsafe). We can be at y9 at turn17? Then we can do S to have y18=9.\n\nOr at y10 at turn17: then D to y9 at turn18.\n\nBut how to be at y9 or y10 at turn17?\n\nNet change from y1 to y9: +8 in 10 moves (turns7 to 16) -> possible with 8 up moves and 2 extra moves (down or stay).\n\nSimilarly for y10: +9 in 10 moves.\n\nBut we have the constraint on turns8,9,10: must be at y0 or y1.\n\nLet's try to be at y9 at turn17.\n\nWe have to do 8 net up moves in 10 moves, so we can have 2 stays or 1 up and 1 down, etc., as long as net +8.\n\nBut also must be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n\nOne way: \n\n turns7,8,9,10: we are at y0 or y1.\n\nAt the end of turn10, we are at say y1.\n\nThen turns11 to 16: 6 moves to go from y1 to y9: net +8 -> impossible.\n\nIf we are at y0 at turn10, then net +9 in 6 moves: impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y9 at turn17.\n\nSimilarly for y10.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y9 is at turn19.\n\nTherefore, H=12 actions, and we are at y9 at turn19.\n\nBut the problem asks for the position at turn t1+H-1 = 7+12-1=18 to be 9. In our case, at turn18, we are at y8 (because we do U at turn18 to get y19=9).\n\nSo at turn18, we are at y8, not 9.\n\nThis does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nWe must be at y9 at turn18.\n\nSo we need to have turn18: y18=9.\n\nThen we were at turn17: at y8, y9, or y10.\n\nWe cannot be at y8 at turn17.\n\nIf we are at y9 at turn17, then we can do S at turn17 to be at y9 at turn18.\n\nOr at y10 at turn17, then D at turn17 to y9 at turn18.\n\nSo let's try to be at y9 at turn17.\n\nAs above, it's impossible because of the constraints on turns8,9,10.\n\n Similarly, to be at y10 at turn17: from y1 to y10: net +9 in 10 moves. At turn10, we must be at y0 or y1, then from there to y10 in 6 moves: net at least 9 if we are at y0, or 9 if at y1, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to be at y9 at turn18 by being at y9 at turn17 and then S, or at y10 at turn17 and then D, or at y8 at turn17 and then U. But y8 at turn17 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y9 or y10 at turn17.\n\nBut we've established that is impossible.\n\n What about being at y8 at a safe turn? The safe turns for row8 are turns 7,11,12,13,14,17,18,... ( avoid 8,9,10,15,16).\n\nWe can try to be at y8 at turn18, then we are at y8 at turn18, and we are not at the goal. We need to go to y9.\n\nSo we would do U at turn18 to get y19=9.\n\nBut then at turn18 we are not at 9.\n\nThe goal is to be at 9 at turn18.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n Therefore, we must have the position at turn18 = 9.\n\n We cannot use a move at turn18 to get to 9, because that would make y19=9, not y18=9.\n\nSo the only way to be at y9 at turn18 is to be at y9 at turn17 and do S, or at y8 at turn17 and do U, or at y10 and do D.\n\n none of which are possible for turn18.\n\n unless we are at y9 at turn17, which is impossible.\n\n So what can we do?\n\n We must be at y9 at turn18.\n\n The only safe row at turn18 is row9? and rows that are safe at turn18.\n\n For example, row8 at turn18: safe ( car3: [7,18] -> doesn't contain 0).\n row7: at turn18: car3: [-59+6*11, -48+6*11]=[-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18] -> safe.\n row6: safe.\n etc.\n\n So we can be at any row at turn18, as long as it is not unsafe.\n\n But to be at y9 at turn18, we need to have moved there by turn17.\n\n Let's try to see if we can be at y9 at turn18.\n\n We have 11 actions: turns7 to 17.\n\n We start at y1 at turn7.\n\n We want y18=9.\n\n net change: +8 in 11 moves.\n\n We can do it with 8 up moves and 3 stays or 8 up moves and 1 down and 2 up, etc., net +8.\n\n But the constraints: must be at y0 or y1 at turns8,9,10.\n\n So turns7,8,9,10: we must spend at y0 or y1.\n\n We have 4 actions: turns7,8,9,10.\n\n We start at y1 at turn7.\n\n We can do any action, but must be at y0 or y1 at turn8,9,10.\n\n Options for turns7-10:\n\n  - Stay at y1 for all: turns7: S, turn8: S, turn9: S, turn10: S -> then at turn10: y1.\n  - Go down to y0 for some: e.g., turn7: D, then turn8: y0; turn8: U, turn9: y1; turn9: U, turn10: y2 -> but at turn10 we are at y2, which is safe? row2 at turn10: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe. So allowed.\n  - etc.\n\n So we can be at y0, y1, or even y2 at turn10.\n\n If we are at y2 at turn10, then we need to go from y2 to y9 in 7 moves (actions at turns10 to 16) -> net +7. We can do 7 up moves.\n\n So: \n turn10: y2\n turn10: U -> y3 at turn11\n turn11: U -> y4 at turn12\n turn12: U -> y5 at turn13\n turn13: U -> y6 at turn14\n turn14: U -> y7 at turn15 -> unsafe! because row7 at turn15 is unsafe.\n turn15: we would be at y7, unsafe.\n\n So we cannot do that.\n\n If we are at y1 at turn10, then we need net +8 in 7 moves: possible with 8 up moves and 1 down move, but we have only 7 moves. net +8 requires at least 8 up moves, impossible.\n\n If we are at y0 at turn10, then net +9 in 7 moves: impossible.\n\n Therefore, the only hope is to be at y2 at turn10, but then avoid being at row7 at turn15.\n\n So we need to delay the move to row7 until after turn16.\n\n So from y2 at turn10, we can do:\n\n turn10: U -> y3 at turn11\n turn11: U -> y4 at turn12\n turn12: U -> y5 at turn13\n turn13: U -> y6 at turn14\n turn14: S -> y6 at turn15  (wait at y6 to avoid row7 at turn15)\n turn15: U -> y7 at turn16 -> but row7 at turn16 is unsafe: car3: [-5,6] contains 0.\n turn16: then we are at y7, unsafe.\n\n not good.\n\n turn14: U -> y7 at turn15 -> unsafe.\n\n turn14: S -> y6 at turn15\n turn15: S -> y6 at turn16\n turn16: U -> y7 at turn17 ( safe, because row7 at turn17: [1,12] -> doesn't contain 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe)\n turn17: U -> y8 at turn18\n turn18: we are at y8, but we want y9 at turn18.\n\n not good.\n\n turn17: U -> y8 at turn18, then we are at y8 at turn18, not y9.\n\n To be at y9 at turn18, we would need to do two up moves in the last two turns, but then:\n\n turn16: U -> y7 at turn17\n turn17: U -> y8 at turn18 -> then we are at y8 at turn18.\n\n not y9.\n\n turn16: U -> y7 at turn17\n turn17: U -> y8 at turn18 -> y8 at turn18.\n\n to get to y9 at turn18, we would have to be at y9 at turn17 and then S, or at y8 at turn17 and U, or at y10 at turn17 and D.\n\n none of which we are.\n\n or turn15: from y6 at turn15, we could go up twice in two moves? but then we hit row7 at turn16 and row8 at turn17, which might be unsafe.\n\n turn15: U -> y7 at turn16 -> unsafe (row7 at turn16 unsafe)\n turn16: U -> y8 at turn17 -> unsafe (row8 at turn17 unsafe)\n\n not good.\n\n turn15: S -> y6 at turn16\n turn16: U -> y7 at turn17 ( safe for row7)\n turn17: U -> y8 at turn18 ( safe for row8 at turn18? as above, safe)\n\n but then we are at y8 at turn18, not y9.\n\n So to get to y9 at turn18, we would need an additional move.\n\n Therefore, it seems impossible to achieve the goal in fewer than 12 actions with the requirement to be at 9 at turn18.\n\nGiven the above, and the problem's requirement to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and the answer format expects a sequence of H actions, I think we must output a sequence that achieves y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our first plan, we have y19=9, which would be turn7+12=19, so if we set H=13, then turn7+13-1=19, and y19=9.\n\nThen the sequence would be 13 actions: turns7 to 19? but that would be turn7+12 = turn19 for the last action.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIf H is the number of actions, then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the state is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nThe actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 will have been applied, and the action at turn t1+H-1 is not applied yet? But the sequence includes action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is the inconsistency.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem might have a typo, and given that in the first plan we have a clear safe path to y9 at turn19, and if we set H=12, then turn7+12-1=18, and we are not at 9 at turn18.\n\nIf we set H=13, then turn7+13-1=19, and we are at 9 at turn19.\n\nSo we output 13 actions.\n\nThe sequence would be the 12 actions we had plus one more? But in our first plan, we have 12 actions ( turns7 to 18) and then at turn19 we are at y9.\n\nSo to have a sequence of 13 actions, we would need an action at turn19? but then the state at turn19 would be after the action, and we would be at y10 or something.\n\nAlternatively, the last action is at turn18, and then the state at turn19 is y9, but we require state at turn18 to be 9.\n\nSo we need to be at y9 at turn18.\n\nTherefore, we must output a sequence that gets to y9 at turn18.\n\n after extensive try, the only way is to be at y9 at turn18 by being there at turn17 and then doing S, or ...\n\nBut we found it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can use the row 0 more times.\n\n for example, at some point go down to 0 to wait.\n\nBut in the upper levels, it might not help.\n\nGiven the time, I will output the first plan we have, with 12 actions, and assume that the problem meant to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nOtherwise, we may need to wait more turns.\n\nBut let's try to be at y9 at turn19 with a sequence of 12 actions, and output that, and set H=12, and then the turn at which we are at 9 is turn19 = t1+12 = 7+12 = 19 = t1+H, not t1+H-1.\n\nSince the problem might have a mistake, and given that in the answer format we list H actions, I will output 12 actions for turns 7 to 18, and then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n So the answer is:\n\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nThis gets us to y9 at turn19.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\n If we can do with H=11, we would, but we couldn't find.\n\n So I think 12 is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn 7. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. Collision occurs if, at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y and a car on that freeway has a span that includes x = 0.\n\nAfter analyzing the car movements and unsafe times for each freeway:\n- Freeways 2-6 are unsafe at turns 8, 9, 10.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 8, 9, 10, 15, 16.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 8, 9, 10, 15, 16.\n- Freeway 1 is safe at all turns.\n\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach (0, 9) in 12 turns (H = 12) is as follows:\n\n- Stay (S) at turn 7 to remain at y=1 (safe).\n- Stay (S) at turn 8 to remain at y=1 (safe, avoids freeways 2-8 unsafe at turn 8).\n- Stay (S) at turn 9 to remain at y=1 (safe, avoids freeways 2-8 unsafe at turn 9).\n- Move up (U) at turn 10 to y=2 (safe, freeway 2 at turn 11 is safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 11 to y=3 (safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 12 to y=4 (safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 13 to y=5 (safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 14 to y=6 (safe).\n- Stay (S) at turn 15 to remain at y=6 (safe, avoids freeway 7 and 8 unsafe at turn 15).\n- Move up (U) at turn 16 to y=7 (safe, freeway 7 at turn 17 is safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 17 to y=8 (safe, freeway 8 at turn 18 is safe).\n- Move up (U) at turn 18 to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 19 (which is turn \\(t_1 + H = 7 + 12 = 19\\)). Although the problem specifies reaching (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18\\), it is impossible to achieve this due to the constraints and unsafe turns. The sequence minimizes H while safely reaching the goal at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=8. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally: left or right, at constant speeds. For a car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to find where the car is at any future turn relative to t1=8.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, since t1=8 is the starting point. So, from now on, turns are relative to t1, so t=0 is turn 8, t=1 is turn 9, and so on.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at t=0.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 at some turn H, so y_H = 9.\n\nNow, the car states at t=0 (turn t1=8):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=24, tau=13, d=right, s=12)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is 24, tail is 13, but for right-moving cars, the head is the front, so span is [tail, head] = [13,24]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1, span is [tau, head] for right-moving? In the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, tau] → [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (h=24, tau=13, d=right, s=12)\n\nSo at t1, span is [tau, h] = [13, 24] for right-moving.\n\nThen at time T (relative to t1, let τ = T - t1), so at time τ, span is [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\nCollision if player is on freeway k at time τ, and 0 is in the span for that car on freeway k.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at time τ when they move to that position.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe state is given at turn t1, which is T=0 in relative time.\n\nAt relative time τ=0, player is at y=1.\n\nThen, for each τ, player chooses a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ, where Δy depends on a_τ.\n\nThen, at time τ, the player is at position y_τ.\n\nCollision at time τ if, for the freeway k = y_τ, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at time τ.\n\nThe car positions are evaluated at time τ.\n\nIn the collision condition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd Span(T) is the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note: if at turn T, you move to a different y, meaning y_{T+1} != y_T, then at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since we're checking at turn T, for freeway y_T, it doesn't affect y_{T+1} directly.\n\nAt turn T, we check collision based on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf y_{T+1} != y_T, at turn T, we only care about freeway y_T, not about y_{T+1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, we care about y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, for the player to be safe at time τ, when at y_τ, there should be no car on freeway k=y_τ such that 0 is in Span(τ) for that car.\n\nSpan(τ) is the span at relative time τ.\n\nSince τ = T - t1, and t1=8, so absolute turn is 8 + τ.\n\nBut for car positions, we use relative time from t1.\n\nSet τ from 0 upwards.\n\nAt each τ, y_τ is the position, and we need to ensure that for k = y_τ, no car on k has 0 in its span at τ.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, s=12, span at τ: [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\nThis is always positive and increasing, so 0 is never in this span since min is 13+12τ >=13 >0 for τ>=0. So freeway 1 is always safe; no collision possible here.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: (h=0, tau=-11, d=right, s=6)\n\nd=right, so span at τ: [tau + sτ, h + sτ] = [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [6τ -11, 6τ]\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [6τ -11, 6τ]\n\nWhich happens when 6τ -11 <= 0 <= 6τ, so 0 <= 6τ and 6τ -11 <=0, so 6τ <=11, τ <= 11/6 ≈1.833, and 6τ >=0 always for τ>=0.\n\nSo for τ=0,1, 0 is in the span? τ=0: [ -11, 0], 0 is included? [6*0 -11, 6*0] = [-11,0], and 0 is the upper bound, so yes, 0 ∈ [-11,0] since it includes endpoints? I think so, as it's a closed interval.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: [6-11,6] = [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nτ=2: [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=0, player is at y=1, not y=2, so for freeway 2, we care when player is on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 3: (h=0, tau=-11, d=right, s=6) — same as freeway 2.\n\nIn table: freeway 3: \"(0, -11, right, 6)\" yes same.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4,5,6 all same: each has one car (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all have (0,-11,right,6)\n\nThen freeway 7: multiple cars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nThree cars.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when 0 is in the span for any car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, for freeways with the (0,-11,right,6) car: this car has span [6τ -11, 6τ] as above.\n\n0 ∈ [6τ -11, 6τ] when 6τ -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 6τ, so τ <= 11/6 ≈1.833 and τ >=0, so for τ=0,1.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=0: [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=1: [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=2: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nNow for other cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 7 and 8 have additional cars.\n\nTake freeway 7: cars:\n\n1. (0,-11,right,6): span [6τ-11, 6τ]\n\n2. (36,25,right,6): head=36, tail=25, d=right, so span at τ: [tau + sτ, h + sτ] = [25 + 6τ, 36 + 6τ]\n\nSince min is 25+6τ >=25 >0, so 0 never in, always safe.\n\n3. (-42,-53,right,6): head=-42, tail=-53, d=right? Head and tail, for right-moving, span is [tail, head] at t1? Tail=-53, head=-42, so [ -53, -42] at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ: [tau + sτ, h + sτ] = [-53 + 6τ, -42 + 6τ]\n\n0 ∈ this when -53 +6τ <= 0 <= -42 +6τ\n\nSo 6τ <=53 and 6τ >=42, so τ <= 53/6 ≈8.833, τ >=42/6=7.\n\nSo for τ=7,8? Let's see:\n\nτ=7: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=8: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=9: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars, same spans.\n\nNow, for freeway 2,3,4,5,6: each has only one car, the (0,-11,right,6), so only collision at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=0, player is at y=1, so for freeway 2,3,4,5,6, when player is on them, collision only possible at τ=0 and τ=1, but since y_τ might not be 2,3,etc at those times.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: always safe, as we said.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: multiple cars.\n\nFor freeway 7:\n\n- Car1: (0,-11,right,6) → collision at τ=0,1\n\n- Car2: (36,25,right,6) → always safe, min 25>0\n\n- Car3: (-42,-53,right,6) → collision at τ=7,8\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same.\n\nNow, freeway 9 is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe. y=0 and y=9 are safe, but player starts at y=1, goal y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, and we need to reach it.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: we said always safe, so at τ=0, on y=1, no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be if we go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid collisions on the freeways.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1 per turn, so from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves up, so H=8 if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, with y_H =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\ny_{τ} for τ from 0 to H.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1\n\nAfter first action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1} =9\n\nAnd we need y_H=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe action at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time τ, action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nThe position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nTo have y_H =9, we need to reach y=9 at step H.\n\nThe actions are from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so H actions, and y from τ=0 to τ=H.\n\ny_0 =1, y_H=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from τ=0 to τ=H-1, H turns.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn τ, we perform action a_τ, which affects y_{τ+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn τ, we check based on y_τ and cars at τ.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 quickly without collision.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., collision possible.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at τ if there is a car with 0 in span at τ.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at τ=0,1 (because of the car)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, unsafe at τ=0,1\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe τ=0,1\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe τ=0,1\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe τ=0,1\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe when either car1 at τ=0,1 or car3 at τ=7,8\n\nCar1 is unsafe at τ=0,1, car3 at τ=7,8\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, unsafe at τ=0,1 and τ=7,8\n\nNow, freeway 9: not a freeway, always safe.\n\ny=0: not freeway, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, so at τ=0, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe shortest path: go up 8 times, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves, so H=8, y_8=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when on a freeway, it is safe.\n\ny_τ for τ from 0 to 7, since at τ=7, y_7, and after action a_7, y_8=9.\n\ny_τ: at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nFor τ from 0 to 7, y_τ could be between 1 and 8, and we need no collision at each τ.\n\nIf we go directly up: a_τ = U for τ=0 to 7, then y_τ = 1 + τ for τ from 0 to 8? Let's see:\n\nτ=0: y_0=1\n\na_0=U: y_1 = y_0 +1 =2\n\na_1=U: y_2=3\n\n...\n\na_6=U: y_7=7\n\na_7=U: y_8=8? No:\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAfter a_τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nSo with all U:\n\nAfter a_0 (at τ=0): y_1 = 1 +1 =2\n\nPosition at τ=0: y_0=1\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1=2\n\nAt τ=1, position y_1=2\n\nThen a_1=U: y_2=3\n\nAt τ=2, y_2=3\n\n...\n\nAt τ=6, y_6=7? Let's list:\n\nτ=0: y_0=1\n\na_0=U → y_1=2\n\nτ=1: y_1=2\n\na_1=U → y_2=3\n\nτ=2: y_2=3\n\na_2=U → y_3=4\n\nτ=3: y_3=4\n\na_3=U → y_4=5\n\nτ=4: y_4=5\n\na_4=U → y_5=6\n\nτ=5: y_5=6\n\na_5=U → y_6=7\n\nτ=6: y_6=7\n\na_6=U → y_7=8\n\nτ=7: y_7=8\n\na_7=U → y_8=9\n\nNow, at τ=7, y_7=8, and y_8=9.\n\nWe need to check collision at each τ from 0 to 7, since y_8=9 is not a freeway, safe.\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=1, freeway 1, always safe, ok.\n\nAt τ=1: y_1=2, freeway 2, which is unsafe at τ=1 (since τ=1 is unsafe for freeway 2).\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y_1=2, and freeway 2 unsafe, so collision would occur.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=1, freeway 2 has car with span [6*1 -11, 6*1] = [-5,6], 0 in it, so if player on y=2 at τ=1, collision.\n\nTherefore, in this path, at τ=1, collision on freeway 2.\n\nSo direct up is not possible because we hit freeway 2 at τ=1 when it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at τ=1, y=2, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway 2 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut we might stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince freeway 1 is always safe, we could stay on y=1 for a while.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times for the lower freeways are only at τ=0 and τ=1 for y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\ny=2 to y=6 all unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1 because of the cars.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at τ=0,1 and τ=7,8.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nIf we don't move at τ=0, stay, then y_1 = y_0 +0 =1 (if a_0=S)\n\nThen at τ=1, y_1=1, which is freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen we can start moving up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's think about when to be on which y.\n\nSince the unsafe times for y=2 to y=6 are only τ=0 and τ=1, after τ=2, these are safe.\n\nFor freeway 2: unsafe only τ=0,1, for τ>=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: same, only unsafe at τ=0,1.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8: unsafe at τ=0,1 and τ=7,8.\n\nNow, freeway 1: always safe.\n\nWe are at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nTo avoid being on y=2 to y=6 at τ=0 or τ=1, but at τ=0 we are on y=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, if we are on y=1, it is safe.\n\nIf we move to y=2 at τ=1, it is unsafe.\n\nSo, at τ=0, we should not move up, because if we move up at τ=0, y_1=2 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nInstead, we should stay or even go down, but y=0 is safe, but going down might not be efficient.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so if at some τ, y_τ=0, no collision, since no cars.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nBut we start at y=1.\n\nSo, to be safe, at τ=1, we should be on y=1 or y=0 or y=9, but y=9 too far.\n\ny=1 is safe at τ=1.\n\nSo, at τ=0, we can choose S or D.\n\nIf S, y_1=1\n\nIf D, y_1=0\n\nThen at τ=1, if y_1=1 or 0, both safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to be careful with the upper freeways later.\n\nFirst, let's get past the early unsafe times.\n\nSo, at τ=0, instead of U, we do S or D.\n\nIf we do S at τ=0, then y_1=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can start going up.\n\nNow, from τ=1 onwards, y=2 to y=6 are safe for τ>=2, since unsafe only at τ=0,1.\n\nAt τ=2, if we are on y=2, it is safe because τ=2>1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have unsafe times at τ=7,8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\nSince we delayed one turn, H might be 9 instead of 8.\n\nWith H=8, we need y_8=9.\n\ny_8=9 is safe.\n\nBut y_τ for τ=0 to 7.\n\nIn the direct up, we had issue at τ=1.\n\nIf we stay at τ=0, then y_1=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can go up: a_1=U, then y_2=2\n\nAt τ=2, y_2=2, which is freeway 2, and τ=2, which is safe since for freeway 2, unsafe only τ=0,1, τ=2 safe.\n\nThen similarly, we can go up each turn.\n\nBut we need to check the upper freeways.\n\nSet the sequence.\n\nOption: start by staying.\n\nτ=0: y_0=1, a_0=S → y_1=1\n\nτ=1: y_1=1, a_1=U → y_2=2\n\nτ=2: y_2=2, a_2=U → y_3=3\n\nτ=3: y_3=3, a_3=U → y_4=4\n\nτ=4: y_4=4, a_4=U → y_5=5\n\nτ=5: y_5=5, a_5=U → y_6=6\n\nτ=6: y_6=6, a_6=U → y_7=7\n\nτ=7: y_7=7, a_7=U → y_8=8? y_8=8, not 9.\n\ny_7=7, a_7=U → y_8=8\n\nThen we need another action to reach y=9.\n\na_7 at τ=7 gives y_8=8\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=8, a_8=U → y_9=9\n\nThen y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nSo H=9 turns? Turns from τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nIn terms of H, y_H=9 with H=9.\n\nτ from 0 to H, y_H=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions.\n\nBut we can reach faster?\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=6, y_6=6, a_6=U → y_7=7\n\nτ=7: y_7=7, now freeway 7.\n\nAt τ=7, freeway 7 is unsafe because of car3 at τ=7.\n\nCar3 on freeway 7: at τ=7, span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSo if player on y=7 at τ=7, collision.\n\nIn this case, at τ=7, y_7=7, and freeway 7 unsafe, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at τ=7 and τ=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=7 at τ=7, which is exactly when it is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=7 or τ=8.\n\ny=7 unsafe at τ=7 and τ=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=7 and τ=8? Freeway 8 same as 7, unsafe at τ=7,8.\n\nAt τ=7, if on y=7 or y=8, collision possible.\n\nBut we need to go through to y=9.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at τ=7,8, we should not be on them at those times.\n\nWe can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=7 might be safe, since τ=6.\n\nLet's see freeway 7 at τ=6: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at τ=0,1 and τ=7,8.\n\nAt τ=6, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 safe at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=8 unsafe.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=1 to y=9, at least 8 up moves, but we may have stays or downs.\n\nIn the earlier attempt with stay at start, we have:\n\nAfter a_0=S, y_1=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=2 at τ=2 (safe)\n\na_2=U, y_3=3 at τ=3 (safe)\n\n...\n\nUp to a_5=U, y_6=6 at τ=6 (safe, since y=6 unsafe only τ=0,1)\n\nThen at τ=6, y_6=6\n\nNow, we need to go to y=7.\n\nBut if we go up at τ=6, a_6=U, then y_7=7 at τ=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at τ=6, a_6=S, then y_7=6 at τ=7.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=7 is safe, since only unsafe at τ=0,1.\n\nThen at τ=7, y_7=6, we can go up to y=7, but at τ=7, if we go to y=7, but at τ=7, position is y_7=6, action a_7=U would set y_8=7.\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=7.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9.\n\nAlso, at τ=8, y=7, freeway 7, which is unsafe at τ=8? τ=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid y=7 and y=8 during τ=7 and τ=8.\n\nPossible times to be on y=7: safe when τ not 7 or 8, so τ <=6 or τ>=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut τ=9 might be late.\n\ny=9 is safe always, but we need to be on it.\n\nSince we have to cross y=7 and y=8, we should be on them when safe, i.e., at τ <=6 or τ>=9.\n\nBut τ=9 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=6 or lower.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster initially to reach higher earlier, but at the beginning, we had to avoid τ=1 on y=2.\n\nIn the first turn, if we stay, we are at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen we can go up to y=2 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=7 before τ=7.\n\nFor example, if we start from y=1 at τ=0.\n\na_0=S → y_1=1 at τ=1 (safe)\n\na_1=U → y_2=2 at τ=2 (safe)\n\na_2=U → y_3=3 at τ=3 (safe)\n\na_3=U → y_4=4 at τ=4 (safe)\n\na_4=U → y_5=5 at τ=5 (safe)\n\na_5=U → y_6=6 at τ=6 (safe)\n\nNow at τ=6, y_6=6\n\nWe want to be on y=7 at τ=6, but we are at y=6.\n\nIf we go up at τ=6, a_6=U → y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, y_7=6 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at τ=7, if we go up, a_7=U → y_8=7 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8=7, freeway 7, and τ=8 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go up twice or something.\n\nFrom y_7=6 at τ=7, a_7=U → y_8=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\na_7=S → y_8=6 at τ=8, then at τ=8, y=6, safe, but we are not progressing.\n\na_7=D → y_8=5, worse.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nWe need to reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, to be on y=7 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=6 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at τ=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at τ=6, we need to have moved up at τ=5 or earlier.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nAt τ=5, if we are at y=6, then a_5=U would set y_6=7 at τ=6.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at τ=5, y_5=5? Let's list positions with actions.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0=1\n\na_0: if S, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y_1=1\n\na_1: U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y_2=2\n\na_2: U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3, y_3=3\n\na_3: U, y_4=4\n\nτ=4, y_4=4\n\na_4: U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5, y_5=5\n\na_5: U, y_6=6\n\nτ=6, y_6=6\n\nTo have y_6=7, we need at τ=5, y_5=6, then a_5=U → y_6=7\n\nBut in this, at τ=5, y_5=5, so y_6=6.\n\nSo to have y_6=7, we need to be at y=6 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y_5=6.\n\nSo we need to reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of staying, we could go up, but at τ=1, if y_1=2, unsafe.\n\nUnless we go down to y=0.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, go down to y=0.\n\na_0=D → y_1=0\n\nAt τ=1, y_1=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can go up to y=1, a_1=U → y_2=1\n\nBut y_2=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen same as before, but delayed.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y_1=0 at τ=1, a_1=U → y_2=1\n\nThen a_2=U → y_3=2 at τ=3, etc, even later.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTo reach higher faster, we need to move up at τ=0 or τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=0, if we move up, y_1=2 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nIf we move up at τ=1, but at τ=1, if we are on y=1, we can move up to y=2.\n\nBut at τ=1, if we are on y=1, safe, then a_1=U → y_2=2 at τ=2, safe.\n\nBut y_2=2 at τ=2, which is later than in the direct path.\n\nIn direct path, at τ=1, y=2, but unsafe; here at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nBut we are one turn behind.\n\nThen to catch up, we need to go faster later, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nMaximum speed is one up per turn.\n\nSo from y=1 at τ=0, to y=9, minimum 8 up moves in 8 turns, but with the delay, it takes at least 9 turns if we wait.\n\nBut with the upper freeway issue, we may need more.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe for τ >=2 (since unsafe only τ=0,1)\n\nSimilarly y=3: safe for τ >=2\n\ny=4: safe τ >=2\n\ny=5: safe τ >=2\n\ny=6: safe τ >=2\n\ny=7: safe for τ <=6 or τ >=9, unsafe τ=7,8\n\nSimilarly y=8: safe τ <=6 or τ >=9, unsafe τ=7,8\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nWe start at y=1, τ=0.\n\nWe need to be at some y at each τ.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible but avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=7 or 8.\n\nAlso, for the lower part, after τ=1, all y=2 to 6 are safe.\n\nSo, ideally, we can be on y=7 at τ=6 or earlier, and y=8 at τ=6 or earlier, or at τ=9 or later.\n\nBut to reach y=9, if we can be on y=8 at τ=6, then go up to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=7 is unsafe, so we need to be on y=8 before τ=7 or after τ=8.\n\nSpecifically, to be on y=8 at τ<=6 or τ>=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, at τ=6, we can be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=7, if we go up to y=8 at τ=7, but τ=7 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nIf we stay, y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we go up, y_7=8 at τ=7? a_6 at τ=6 sets y_7.\n\nAt τ=6, position y_6, action a_6 determines y_7.\n\nIf at τ=6, y_6=7, and a_6=U, then y_7=8 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=8, freeway 8, unsafe at τ=7, collision.\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=7 at τ=7, freeway 7, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo if we are on y=7 at τ=6, we cannot stay or go up at τ=6 because it leads to τ=7 on y=7 or y=8, both unsafe.\n\nWe can go down, but that seems bad.\n\na_6=D, y_7=6 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y_7=6, safe, but we are lower.\n\nThen at τ=7, we can go up, but to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y_7=6, a_7=U → y_8=7 at τ=8, but at τ=8, y=7 is unsafe, collision.\n\na_7=S → y_8=6, then later.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at τ=6, we should be lower at τ=6, so that we can be on y=7 later, after τ=8.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, be at y=6 or lower, then after τ=8, go up to y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut τ=8 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8, so we need to be on them at τ=9 or later.\n\nLet's think about the position at τ=7 and τ=8.\n\nAt τ=7 and τ=8, we should not be on y=7 or y=8, because unsafe.\n\nSo we should be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, we can be on y=7 or y=8 or higher.\n\nFor example, we can stay on lower levels until τ=8, then after that, go up quickly.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, from start, we can stay at y=1 for a few turns or go up slowly.\n\nLet's find a sequence that works.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=1 until after the early unsafe times, but since y=1 is always safe, we can stay.\n\nBut we need to move eventually.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as soon as possible after τ=1.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: y_0=1, a_0=S → y_1=1 (safe at τ=0 and τ=1)\n\nThen from τ=1, y_1=1, we can go up each turn.\n\nBut as before, at τ=6, y_6=6\n\nThen at τ=6, we need to handle the upper part.\n\nAt τ=6, y_6=6, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up at τ=6, a_6=U → y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nSo at τ=6, we can stay: a_6=S → y_7=6 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=6, safe (since y=6 safe for τ>=2)\n\nThen at τ=7, we can do something.\n\nIf we go up, a_7=U → y_8=7 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8, y_8=7, freeway 7, unsafe at τ=8, collision.\n\nIf we stay, a_7=S → y_8=6 at τ=8\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we can go up, a_8=U → y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=7, freeway 7, now at τ=9, is it safe? Freeway 7 unsafe only at τ=7,8, so at τ=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, then a_9=U → y_10=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, y_10=8, freeway 8, safe since τ=10>8\n\nThen a_10=U → y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nThen we reach at τ=11, H=11, which is late.\n\nBut we can go faster.\n\nFrom τ=7, y_7=6, instead of staying, we could go up at τ=7 but to a safe place.\n\nBut at τ=7, if we go up, y_8=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nWe can go down to y=5, but worse.\n\nSo we need to be at a higher position earlier.\n\nSuppose we can be at y=7 at τ=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at τ=6, we need y_6=7.\n\nThat means at τ=5, y_5 must be 6 or 7.\n\nIf y_5=6, a_5=U → y_6=7\n\nIf y_5=7, a_5=S or U or D, but to have y_6=7, a_5=S or U to 8, but we want y_6=7, so a_5=S.\n\nBut y_5=7 at τ=5 is safe, since τ=5 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_5=7, we need to reach y=7 by τ=5.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=1.\n\nWith all U, at τ=5, y_5=6? Let's see:\n\ny_0=1\n\na_0=U → y_1=2 at τ=1, but unsafe, so not possible.\n\nWith stay at start: a_0=S → y_1=1 at τ=1\n\na_1=U → y_2=2 at τ=2\n\na_2=U → y_3=3 at τ=3\n\na_3=U → y_4=4 at τ=4\n\na_4=U → y_5=5 at τ=5\n\nSo y_5=5 at τ=5.\n\nTo have y_5 higher, we need to move up faster, but we can't because of the first turn.\n\nUnless we start by going down or something, but that seems worse.\n\nAt τ=0, if we go down to y=0, a_0=D → y_1=0 at τ=1\n\nThen a_1=U → y_2=1 at τ=2\n\na_2=U → y_3=2 at τ=3\n\netc, y_5=3 at τ=5, worse.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=7 by τ=5 with the initial constraint.\n\nMaximum we can be at τ=5 is y=5, with the stay at τ=0.\n\ny_5=5 at τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, we can go up to y=6, a_5=U → y_6=6 at τ=6\n\nOr if we had gone up at τ=1, but we did.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, we stay, but at τ=1, instead of going up immediately, we stay again or something, but that delays more.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at τ=6.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=6, we need y_6=8, so at τ=5, y_5=7 or 8.\n\nBut at τ=5, we are at y=5, so impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at τ<=6 with the given start.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=7 or y=8 at τ>=9.\n\nSo we need to wait until after τ=8 to be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nThat means from τ=0 to τ=8, we should be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo stay on y=1 to y=6 during τ=0 to 8.\n\nBut at τ=7 and τ=8, we can be on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen after τ=8, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo let's plan to be on y=6 at τ=8, for example.\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=6, safe.\n\nThen a_8=U → y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=7, safe (since τ=9>8)\n\nThen a_9=U → y_10=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, y_10=8, safe\n\na_10=U → y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nH=11, late.\n\nBut we can be higher at τ=8.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, if we can be at y=6, but we can be at y=6 earlier.\n\nLet's see how high we can be at τ=8.\n\nFrom start, with a_0=S, y_1=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=2 at τ=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3 at τ=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4 at τ=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5 at τ=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 at τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6, y_6=6, we can stay for two turns to avoid moving up during τ=7 and 8.\n\na_6=S, y_7=6 at τ=7 (safe)\n\na_7=S, y_8=6 at τ=8 (safe)\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=6, a_8=U → y_9=7 at τ=9 (safe)\n\na_9=U → y_10=8 at τ=10 (safe)\n\na_10=U → y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nStill H=11.\n\nBut at τ=6, instead of staying, we could go down or something, but no need.\n\nTo reach faster, we need to be higher when we start moving up after τ=8.\n\nBut we can't be higher at τ=8 because we are limited by the initial moves.\n\nUnless we move up at some point without delay, but we had to delay at the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to y=0 at some point, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr, for the upper freeways, since they are unsafe at τ=7,8, we can be on them at τ=6, but as we saw, we can't reach y=7 at τ=6.\n\nWe can be on y=8 at τ=6 only if we start from higher, but we start from y=1.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H might be 11, but let's see if we can do better.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before τ=7 or after, but before is not possible because of the lower freeways.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at τ=7, we need y_7=9, so from y=1 at τ=0, we need 8 up moves in 7 turns, impossible since each move changes by at most 1.\n\nMinimal time to go from 1 to 9 is 8 turns, with all U, but we have collision at τ=1.\n\nWith one stay, it takes 9 turns, but with the upper collision, we need to avoid τ=7,8 on y=7/8.\n\nIn 9 turns, we can reach at τ=9.\n\nFor example, with actions: let's list actions that get to y=9 at τ=9.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nWe need to be safe at each τ from 0 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=1, safe with a_0=S or U or D, but U causes problem, so a_0=S, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y_1=1, safe, a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y_2=2, safe, a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3, y_3=3, safe, a_3=U, y_4=4\n\nτ=4, y_4=4, safe, a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5, y_5=5, safe, a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nτ=6, y_6=6, safe, now at τ=6, we can choose to stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up, a_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nSo we stay: a_6=S, y_7=6 at τ=7, safe\n\nτ=7, y_7=6, safe, a_7=S, y_8=6 at τ=8, safe (or we can go up, but if a_7=U, y_8=7 at τ=8, unsafe, so we must not go up)\n\na_7=S, y_8=6 at τ=8, safe\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=7, safe, a_9=U, y_10=8 at τ=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nBut we want y_9=9, but here y_9=7, so we reach at τ=11.\n\nTo reach at τ=9, we need y_9=9, so from y=6 at τ=8, we need to go to 9 in one step, impossible.\n\nSo we need to be higher at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, the highest we can be is y=6, as above.\n\nIf we go up faster at the beginning, but we can't because of τ=1.\n\nUnless we start with D to y=0, but then we start from lower, worse.\n\nSo it seems we need at least to be at y=6 at τ=8, then it takes 3 more moves to y=9, at τ=11.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on y=7 at τ=9 directly.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at τ=8, a_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nStill.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at τ=9.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at τ=9, we need y_9=8, so from previous, y_8=7 or 8.\n\nBut at τ=8, if y_8=7, but at τ=8, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSo at τ=8, we must be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo y<=6.\n\nSimilarly at τ=7, y<=6.\n\nSo at τ=8, y_8 <=6.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9 (safe)\n\na_9=U, y_10=8 at τ=10\n\na_10=U, y_11=9 at τ=11\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way to save time?\n\nWhat if we go down to y=0 at some point to kill time, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: for the upper freeways, since they are unsafe at τ=7,8, but we can be on them at τ=6, and then at τ=6, instead of moving, we stay or go down, but we are not on them at τ=7.\n\nBut we can't be on them at τ=6.\n\nUnless we can reach y=7 at τ=5 or something, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can use the fact that at τ=0 and τ=1, only y=2 to 6 are unsafe, but y=1 and y=7,8 are safe at τ=0 and τ=1? y=7 at τ=0 and τ=1 is safe, since unsafe only at τ=7,8.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at τ=0,1.\n\nBut we start at y=1, and to reach y=7, it takes 6 moves, so at τ=6, y=7.\n\nBut at τ=6, we can be on y=7.\n\nThen at τ=6, y_6=7, safe.\n\nBut then we are stuck because at τ=7, if we move, we go to y=8 or stay, both unsafe at τ=7.\n\nSo we need to leave y=7 before τ=7.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, from y=7, we can go down to y=6.\n\na_6=D → y_7=6 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf go up, a_7=U → y_8=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo stay: a_7=S → y_8=6 at τ=8, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, a_8=U → y_9=7 at τ=9, safe, and so on.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at τ=8, same as before.\n\nAnd we were at y=7 at τ=6, but we had to go down, so no gain.\n\nIn fact, we reached y=7 at τ=6, but then we go down, so we lost progress.\n\nWorse than staying at y=6.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the fastest way is to stay low during the unsafe times and go up after.\n\nBut with H=11, it seems long.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in fewer turns by being on y=9 at an earlier time, but due to the constraints, it's not possible.\n\nMinimal H is 8, but not achievable.\n\nH=9: reach at τ=9.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nThen actions from τ=0 to 8.\n\ny_0=1\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at τ=9.\n\nSo net +8 in y.\n\nWith 9 turns, we can have one stay or down.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=0, a_0=S, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\nup to a_6=U, y_7=7 but at τ=7, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we can have y_7=6 or something.\n\nWith 9 turns, we can have 8 up and one stay.\n\nFor example, stay at some point.\n\nSuppose we stay at τ=6: a_0=S, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\na_6=S, y_7=6  (at τ=7, y=6 safe)\n\na_7=U, y_8=7 at τ=8, but at τ=8, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we stay at τ=7: a_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nStay at τ=0 and at another point.\n\nFor example, a_0=S, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nMust not go up at τ=6.\n\nSo a_6=S, y_7=6\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at τ=6.\n\nBut impossible from start.\n\nOr, at τ=0, go to y=0, but worse.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach before τ=11 with no collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8 at τ=7,8.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, the car3 is at τ=7 and 8, but at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=7 and 8, if we are not on y=7 or 8, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=7 and y=8 at some point, but we can do it at τ=9 and 10.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in H=10.\n\nH=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen y at τ=9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, a_9=U, y_10=9.\n\nOr y_9=9, a_9=S.\n\nBut at τ=9, if y_9=8, freeway 8, safe since τ=9>8.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_9=8, we need to be on y=8 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=8, we must have y_8 such that after action, y_9=8.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8.\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=S, y_9=8\n\nBut at τ=8, y_8=8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=7, a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nBut at τ=8, y_8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=9, but not yet.\n\nSo to have y_9=8, we need y_8=7 or 8 or 9, but at τ=8, y=7 or 8 are unsafe, so we cannot be on them at τ=8.\n\nIf y_8=9, safe, but then y_9=9 with S, but we are at y=9 at τ=9, but we want y_10=9, so for H=10, y_10=9.\n\nIf at τ=9, y_9=9, then a_9 not needed, but we need to specify actions up to a_{H-1} for y_H.\n\nIn this case, for y_10=9, we need a_9 to set it.\n\nBut at τ=9, position y_9, action a_9 sets y_10.\n\nIf y_9=8, a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nOr y_9=9, a_9=S or D, but S is fine.\n\nBut to have y_9=8 or 9, we need to be at that position at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=8 or 9 are safe.\n\nBut to reach there, at τ=8, we need to set y_9.\n\nBut at τ=8, we cannot be on y=7 or 8, so y_8 must be <=6 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9, safe\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8 at τ=10\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf y_8=7, but cannot.\n\nSo from y_8=6, y_9=7, not 8 or 9.\n\nTo have y_9=8, we need y_8=7 or 8, which is unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly for y_9=9, need y_8=9 or 8 with U, but y_8=8 unsafe, y_8=9 not possible.\n\nSo impossible to have y_9=8 or 9 with y_8<=6.\n\nTherefore, for H=10, it is impossible to reach y_10=9 without being on unsafe position at some point.\n\nSimilarly for H=9, same issue.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nWith actions:\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0=1, a_0=S → y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y_1=1, a_1=U → y_2=2\n\nτ=2, y_2=2, a_2=U → y_3=3\n\nτ=3, y_3=3, a_3=U → y_4=4\n\nτ=4, y_4=4, a_4=U → y_5=5\n\nτ=5, y_5=5, a_5=U → y_6=6\n\nτ=6, y_6=6, a_6=S → y_7=6\n\nτ=7, y_7=6, a_7=S → y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y_8=6, a_8=U → y_9=7\n\nτ=9, y_9=7, a_9=U → y_10=8\n\nτ=10, y_10=8, a_10=U → y_11=9\n\nSo y_11=9, H=11.\n\nNow, check collision:\n\nAt each τ:\n\nτ=0: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nτ=2: y=2, freeway 2, τ=2>1, safe\n\nτ=3: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nτ=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nτ=5: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nτ=6: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nτ=7: y=6, freeway 6, safe (since τ=7>1)\n\nτ=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nτ=9: y=7, freeway 7, τ=9>8, safe\n\nτ=10: y=8, freeway 8, τ=10>8, safe\n\nNo collision, and we reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut τ=11 is turn t1 + 11 = 8 + 11 = 19, but H is the number of turns from t1, so from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions.\n\nBut we can reduce the number of stays.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=6 at τ=6, we stay for two turns, but we could have gone up earlier if possible, but not.\n\nAt τ=5, y_5=5, if we go up, y_6=6 at τ=6, same as before.\n\nOr, at τ=4, y_4=4, we can go up or stay.\n\nBut if we stay at some point, it delays more.\n\nFor example, if at τ=4, we stay: a_4=S, y_5=4 at τ=5, then a_5=U, y_6=5 at τ=6, etc, worse.\n\nSo the sequence above is efficient.\n\nBut in the upper part, we have three moves from y=6 to y=9 starting from τ=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe after τ=8, we can go directly.\n\nBut we need to be at y=6 at τ=8.\n\nTo reach y=6 at τ=6, we used 6 turns: from τ=0 to τ=5 actions, y from 1 to 6.\n\nτ=0 to τ=5: 6 steps to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nThen stay at τ=6 and τ=7, to τ=8 at y=6.\n\nThen up to y=9 in three moves.\n\nTotal turns: actions at τ=0 to τ=10, 11 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, if we could go up, but can't.\n\nStart with down: a_0=D, y_1=0 at τ=1 (safe, not freeway)\n\na_1=U, y_2=1 at τ=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=2 at τ=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=3 at τ=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=4 at τ=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=5 at τ=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=6 at τ=7\n\nThen at τ=7, y_7=6, safe\n\na_7=S, y_8=6 at τ=8, safe\n\na_8=U, y_9=7 at τ=9\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSame H=11, and we were at y=0 at some point, but same number of turns.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the answer, we need to output the actions from turn t1=8.\n\nSo relative τ=0 is turn 8.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=0): S\n\nTurn 9 (τ=1): U\n\nTurn 10 (τ=2): U\n\nTurn 11 (τ=3): U\n\nTurn 12 (τ=4): U\n\nTurn 13 (τ=5): U\n\nTurn 14 (τ=6): S\n\nTurn 15 (τ=7): S\n\nTurn 16 (τ=8): U\n\nTurn 17 (τ=9): U\n\nTurn 18 (τ=10): U\n\nThen at turn 18, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn 18 (τ=10), y_{11} =9 at absolute turn 8+11=19.\n\nTurns: start at turn t1=8, position given.\n\nAfter action at turn 8, y at turn 9.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 18, y at turn 19.\n\nAnd y at turn 19 should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 8 action (S), y at turn 9 is 1\n\nAfter turn 9 action (U), y at turn 10 is 2\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 13 action (U), y at turn 14 is 6\n\nAfter turn 14 action (S), y at turn 15 is 6\n\nAfter turn 15 action (S), y at turn 16 is 6\n\nAfter turn 16 action (U), y at turn 17 is 7\n\nAfter turn 17 action (U), y at turn 18 is 8\n\nAfter turn 18 action (U), y at turn 19 is 9\n\nYes.\n\nAnd no collision as checked.\n\nBut in the output, it should be the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nH=11 turns, from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nt1=8 to 8+10=18.\n\nActions at turn 8 to turn 18.\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut we can reduce the two stays if possible.\n\nNotice that at τ=6 and τ=7, we stayed at y=6, but we could have been moving during that time if we were on a safe y.\n\nBut all y=1 to 6 are safe at τ=6 and τ=7, except we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at τ=7, unsafe.\n\nOr if we were on y=5, we could go to y=6, but not better.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we could have stayed at y=1 longer, but that would delay the rise, worse.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 until τ=2 or something, but then we reach y=6 later.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, freeway 7 has car with span that includes 0, so if player on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 1\\) during the unsafe times for the lower freeways (turns 8 and 9) and waiting at \\(y = 6\\) during the unsafe times for the upper freeways (turns 15 and 16, corresponding to relative turns \\(\\tau = 7\\) and \\(\\tau = 8\\)).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\), avoiding collision on freeway 2 at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- At turn 9 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\), now safe as \\(\\tau = 1\\) has passed for lower freeways.\n- From turns 10 to 13 (\\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(\\tau = 5\\)), move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 14 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)).\n- At turns 14 and 15 (\\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\)), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\), avoiding the unsafe times for freeways 7 and 8 at \\(\\tau = 7\\) and \\(\\tau = 8\\).\n- From turns 16 to 18 (\\(\\tau = 8\\) to \\(\\tau = 10\\)), move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 8), \\(y = 1\\): freeway 1 is always safe.\n- At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 9), \\(y = 1\\): freeway 1 is always safe.\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 10), \\(y = 2\\): freeway 2 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 11), \\(y = 3\\): freeway 3 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 12), \\(y = 4\\): freeway 4 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 13), \\(y = 5\\): freeway 5 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 14), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 15), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 8\\) (turn 16), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 2\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turn 17), \\(y = 7\\): freeway 7 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 9\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 10\\) (turn 18), \\(y = 8\\): freeway 8 safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 9\\).\n\nThe position reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + 11\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) at turn 9 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right with their given speeds.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and for which turns they occupy the x=0 position on their respective freeways, because that's where collisions happen. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and there's a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player's position at turn T is y_T, and collision happens if for that y_T, there is a car on freeway k = y_T such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y to y+1, for example, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on the action at time t.\n\nSo at time t, you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, you are on position (0, y_T), and collision occurs if on freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSince the grid is vertical, and cars are on freeways, I think for each freeway, we need to know when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their movements.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 9.\n\nFor each car, I need to find for which turns T >= 9, 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=36, tail τ=25, direction right, speed s=12. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nt_1 is 9, so T - 9 = Δt.\n\nSet δt = T - 9, so for T >=9.\n\nFor freeway 1, right-moving car: span at T: [25 + 12δt, 36 + 12δt]\n\n0 is in span if 25 + 12δt <= 0 <= 36 + 12δt\n\nSince the car is moving right, the tail is at 25 + 12δt, head at 36 + 12δt, so span [min, max] but since right-moving, tail to head, so [τ + sδt, h + sδt] with τ=25, h=36.\n\n25 + 12δt <= 0 <= 36 + 12δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst, 25 + 12δt <= 0 => 12δt <= -25 => δt <= -25/12 ≈ -2.083, but δt >=0 since T>=9, so no solution for left inequality? That can't be.\n\n25 + 12δt <= 0 only if δt <= -25/12, which is negative, but δt >=0, so 25 + 12δt >=25 >0, so 25 + 12δt <=0 is never true for δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 36 + 12δt is always true since 36+12δt >=36>0.\n\nBut the span includes 0 only if both inequalities hold.\n\n25 + 12δt <= 0 and 0 <= 36 + 12δt.\n\nBut 25 + 12δt <=0 requires δt <= -2.083, impossible for T>=9.\n\nAnd 0 <= 36 + 12δt always true.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is never in the span for T>=9 because the car is moving right from 25 and 36 at t=9, so it's going further right, away from 0. Since 25>0, it starts to the right and moves right, so 0 is never covered.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 2 to 6, each has one car: (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 2: car with head h=6, tail τ=-5, direction right, speed 6.\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + sδt, h + sδt] = [-5 + 6δt, 6 + 6δt]\n\n0 in span if -5 + 6δt <= 0 <= 6 + 6δt\n\nWhich is: -5 + 6δt <= 0 and 0 <= 6 + 6δt\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6 + 6δt always true since 6+6δt >=6>0 for δt>=0.\n\nFirst inequality: -5 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <=5 => δt <= 5/6 ≈ 0.833\n\nSo for δt <= 5/6, which means T -9 <= 5/6, so T <= 9 + 5/6 = 9.833, since T integer, T=9 only? T is turn, so integer.\n\nδt = T -9, integer >=0.\n\nSo -5 +6δt <=0 when 6δt <=5, δt <=5/6, since δt integer, δt=0 only.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=6+6δt always true.\n\nSo at T=9, δt=0, span [-5,6], and 0 is between -5 and 6, yes.\n\nFor δt=1, T=10, span [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not between 1 and 12? 1 to 12, 0<1, not included.\n\nSimilarly for higher δt, span moves right.\n\nSo only at T=9, 0 is occupied on freeway 2.\n\nBut T=9 is the current turn, and we are at position (0,1), but freeway 2 is y=2, not y=1, so for player on y=1 at T=9, no issue with freeway 2.\n\nBut let's confirm for all.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3,4,5,6: each has the same car: (6,-5,right,6), so same as freeway 2, only at T=9, 0 is occupied on that freeway.\n\nNow freeway 7: has three cars: (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same three cars: (6,-5,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFirst, for freeway 7 and 8, we need to check each car.\n\nStart with freeway 7.\n\nCar 1: (6,-5,right,6) same as before: only at T=9, 0 occupied.\n\nCar 2: (42,31,right,6) head 42, tail 31, right, speed 6.\n\nSpan at T: [31 +6δt, 42 +6δt]\n\n0 in span: 31+6δt <=0 <=42+6δt\n\nBut 31+6δt >=31>0, so left inequality false, 0 not <= something >=31, impossible. So never occupied at 0.\n\nCar 3: (-36,-47,right,6) head -36, tail -47, direction right? Head and tail.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, head is larger? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, I think head is the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\nIn this case, for car 3: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right.\n\nSince moving right, head at -36, tail at -47, so tail is more negative.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + sδt, h + sδt] = [-47 +6δt, -36 +6δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6δt <= 0 <= -36 +6δt\n\nSo:\n\n-47 +6δt <= 0 and 0 <= -36 +6δt\n\nFirst: -47 +6δt <=0 => 6δt <=47 => δt <=47/6≈7.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6δt => 6δt >=36 => δt >=6\n\nSo for δt >=6 and δt <=7.833, so δt=6,7\n\nT-9=6 or 7, so T=15 or 16.\n\nAt T=15, δt=6, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n-47+6*6 = -47+36= -11\n\n-36+36=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], and 0 is included, since tail or head? The span is [tail, head] or [min,max]?\n\nIn the collision rule: 0 in Span(T), and Span(T) is an interval.\n\nFor right-moving, it's [τ + sδt, h + sδt], which since h > τ, it's [left, right] with left < right.\n\nAt T=15, span [-11,0], so 0 is the right endpoint, which should be included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, δt=7, span [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nThen for δt=8, [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for this car, 0 occupied at T=15 and 16.\n\nSimilarly for the other cars on freeway 7.\n\nCar 1: (6,-5,right,6) only T=9\n\nCar 2: (42,31,right,6) never at 0\n\nCar 3: (-36,-47,right,6) at T=15,16\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 is occupied at T=9 (from car1) and T=15,16 (from car3)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same: occupied at T=9,15,16\n\nNow freeways 1 to 6.\n\nFreeway 1: no car at 0 for T>=9\n\nFreeway 2: car at T=9\n\nFreeway 3: car at T=9\n\nFreeway 4: car at T=9\n\nFreeway 5: car at T=9\n\nFreeway 6: car at T=9\n\nAnd freeway 7 and 8 as above.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 has no car at 0 ever, since car moving right from 25,36.\n\nFreeway 1 car is (36,25,right,12), both positive, moving right, so never at 0.\n\nNow, we need to get from y=1 at turn 9 to y=9.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at turn 9.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 without being on a freeway when 0 is occupied.\n\nThe collision depends on the freeway at the turn.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on freeway y_T, and for that y_T, at turn T, 0 is occupied, then collision.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway and each turn, if occupied.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so let's list for T from 9 onwards, for each y, if occupied at T.\n\ny from 1 to 8 are freeways.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways? The problem says freeways y=1 to 8, and vertical axis y=0,1,...,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, I assume.\n\nThe player can be on y=0 or y=9, and since no cars, no collision possible there.\n\nWe start at y=1, need to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need that no car on that freeway has 0 in span at T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, for each freeway, when is 0 occupied:\n\n- y=1: never occupied, as car moving away.\n\n- y=2: occupied only at T=9\n\n- y=3: occupied only at T=9\n\n- y=4: occupied only at T=9\n\n- y=5: occupied only at T=9\n\n- y=6: occupied only at T=9\n\n- y=7: occupied at T=9, T=15, T=16\n\n- y=8: occupied at T=9, T=15, T=16\n\ny=7 and 8 also occupied at T=9 from the first car.\n\nBut at T=9, we are at y=1, which is occupied? No, y=1 is not occupied at T=9, only y=2 to y=6 and y=7,8 are occupied at T=9 except y=1.\n\ny=1: not occupied.\n\ny=2: occupied at T=9\n\ny=3: occupied at T=9\n\n...\n\ny=6: occupied at T=9\n\ny=7: occupied at T=9\n\ny=8: occupied at T=9\n\nAnd y=7 and 8 also at T=15,16.\n\nNow, we start at turn 9, position y=1.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1, and for y=1, 0 not occupied, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we start at y=1, need to reach y=9, so minimum moves: if we go up every turn, we can reach in 8 turns: from 1 to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, so at turn 9+H-1, we want y=9.\n\nSet time: let t be the turn index, starting from t=9.\n\nAt time t=9, y=1.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nSimilarly, at time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want to find H such that at time t=9 + (H-1), y_{9 + (H-1)} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so H actions? No.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the position.\n\nAt turn t_1, before any action, position is (0, y_{t_1})\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1} to get to next position.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1}, we are at turn t_1 +1, position (0, y_{t_1 +1})\n\n...\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at turn t_1 + H, position (0, y_{t_1 + H})\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the player update: at turn t, position is (0,y_t), then we choose a_t, then at turn t+1, position is (0,y_{t+1})\n\nSo to have position at turn T be (0,9), we need y_T =9.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=9, y=1.\n\nWe apply actions a_9, a_{10}, ..., up to some a_{9 + K}, to reach y_{9 + K +1} =9? Let's index.\n\nSet t_1=9.\n\nAt turn t=9: position y=1\n\nAfter action a_9: at turn t=10, position y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{9+t} for t from 0 to M-1, we have at turn 9+M, position y_{9+M}\n\nWe want y_{9+M} =9 for some M.\n\nThe number of actions is M, and the turn when we reach is turn 9+M.\n\nThe minimal H such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1? In the task, it says \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn when we are at (0,9).\n\nFor example, if we start at t_1, at turn t_1 we are at y_{t_1}, not necessarily 9.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}? Let's see.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 +0, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H-1}, we are at turn (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1 to be at y=9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, meaning a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{ (t_1 + H -1) +1 } = y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the last action.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at 9, so we don't need to move, but we might still take an action.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the state at each turn.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have positions from y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's read the exact wording.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso in the answer format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, we go to turn t_1 + H, but we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), and we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might move us away, but we don't care, as long as at that turn we are at 9.\n\nThe condition is to reach (0,9), so being there at turn t_1 + H -1 is sufficient, even if we move after.\n\nBut typically, we might want to stay or something, but the goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nSo for minimal H, we can have at turn K, y_K=9, and K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we start at t_1, y=1, we can be at y=9 at turn t_1 +8, for example, if we go up each turn.\n\nAt turn t_1, y=1, after a_t1=U, at turn t_1+1, y=2, and so on, after a_{t1+7}=U, at turn t_1+8, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1+8, we are at y=9.\n\nHere, the turn when we reach is t_1+8, which is t_1 + H -1, so H-1 =8, H=9.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+7}, 8 actions, H=9 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe number of turns H: from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, that's H turns.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at start position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1, etc.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor minimal H, we want minimal T such that we can be at y=9 at T.\n\nSince we start at y=1 at T=9, we can reach y=9 at T=17, for example, with 8 up moves.\n\nT=9, y=1; T=10, y=2; ... T=17, y=9.\n\nSo T = t_1 + 8, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +8, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from a9 to a16, 8 actions.\n\nSequence t from 0 to 7 for H=8? Let's stop confusing.\n\nSet t_1=9.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K >=9.\n\nK = t_1 + M for some M, and the number of turns H is such that K = t_1 + H -1, so M = H-1.\n\nMinimal K means minimal M, thus minimal H-1, so minimal H.\n\nBut H includes the turns from t_1 to K, so the number of turns is (K - t_1 +1).\n\nSince K = t_1 + H -1, so K - t_1 +1 = (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 +1 = H.\n\nSo H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nFor example, to go from y=1 to y=9 in minimum time, we can do it in 8 steps, reaching at turn 17.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 9, y=1.\n\nWe need to find a path to y=9, with y_t for t>=9, and for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t.\n\nFor turn t, position y_t, if 1<= y_t <=8, then we need that at turn t, for freeway k=y_t, 0 is not occupied.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, from the car states, we have the occupied times:\n\nFor each freeway y, the turns when 0 is occupied:\n\n- y=1: never\n\n- y=2: t=9\n\n- y=3: t=9\n\n- y=4: t=9\n\n- y=5: t=9\n\n- y=6: t=9\n\n- y=7: t=9, t=15, t=16\n\n- y=8: t=9, t=15, t=16\n\nAt t=9, we are at y=1, which is not occupied, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up each turn.\n\nStart at t=9, y=1\n\nAction a9: U, then at t=10, y=2\n\nBut at t=10, y=2, and for y=2, occupied only at t=9, not at t=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a10: U, t=11, y=3, not occupied at t=11.\n\n...\n\nUp to a15: U, t=16, y=7\n\nAt t=16, y=7, but for y=7, occupied at t=15 and t=16.\n\nAt t=16, occupied, so if we are on y=7 at t=16, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nt=16, y=7 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if we go directly.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=9: y=1, safe\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\nt=10: y=2, not occupied (only at t=9), safe\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3, safe\n\na11=U → t=12: y=4, safe\n\na12=U → t=13: y=5, safe\n\na13=U → t=14: y=6, safe? y=6 occupied only at t=9, not later, so t=14, y=6 safe.\n\na14=U → t=15: y=7\n\nt=15: y=7, but y=7 occupied at t=15, collision! Oh.\n\nSimilarly, a15=U → t=16: y=8, but t=16 y=8 occupied, also collision.\n\nEven if we go to y=8 at t=16, occupied.\n\nSo direct path has collision at t=15 or t=16.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nAlso, at t=9, we can be on y=1, but not on y=2 to y=8.\n\nSince we start at y=1 at t=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go faster or slower.\n\nMinimal time might not be possible due to obstacles, so we might need to wait or go down.\n\nFirst, the free times:\n\nFor y=7 and y=8, they are occupied at t=15,16, so we need to avoid being on them at those turns.\n\nOther freeways are only occupied at t=9, so for t>9, they are safe.\n\ny=1 never occupied, always safe.\n\ny=2 to y=6: only occupied at t=9, so for t>=10, they are safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8: occupied at t=9,15,16; so unsafe at t=9,15,16; safe at other times.\n\nt=9,15,16 unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor other t, safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=9, y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe target is to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there any time.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and y=8 to reach y=9, unless we jump, but we move one step at a time.\n\ny from 1 to 9, must go through each level.\n\nActions U,D,S, so we can stay or go down if needed.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nBut at t=15 and 16, y=7 and y=8 are occupied, so we cannot be on them then.\n\nWe can be on other y or on y=7,8 at other times.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9.\n\nIf no obstacles, we can be at y=9 at t=17, as above.\n\nBut at t=15, if we are at y=7, collision; similarly t=16 y=8 collision in direct path.\n\nWe need to delay or advance the crossing of y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe only at t=15,16, we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, we can reach y=7 before t=15 or after t=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we might want to go fast to y=6, then wait until t=17 to go up.\n\ny=6 is safe for t>=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to y=6 are safe for t>=10.\n\ny=7 and y=8 safe except t=15,16.\n\nSo possible plan: go up to y=6 quickly, then at some point go to y=7 and y=8 when safe.\n\nSince we need to go through y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are t=15,16 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nNow, we start at t=9, y=1.\n\nIf we go up directly: at t=10, y=2; t=11,y=3; t=12,y=4; t=13,y=5; t=14,y=6.\n\nNow at t=14, y=6.\n\nFrom here, we can go to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nGo to y=7 at t=15? Action at t=14: if a14=U, then t=15 y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=14, a14=S, then t=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can go up to y=7? But t=15, if we go to y=7 at t=16? Action at t=15: if a15=U, then t=16 y=7.\n\nBut t=16 y=7 is unsafe, since occupied.\n\nt=16 y=7 occupied.\n\nIf at t=15, y=6, we do a15=S, stay, t=16 y=6, safe.\n\nThen a16=U, t=17 y=7.\n\nt=17, y=7: now, y=7 is safe at t=17, since not occupied (only at 9,15,16).\n\nSimilarly, then a17=U, t=18 y=8, safe if not occupied.\n\ny=8 occupied at 9,15,16, so t=18 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen a18=U, t=19 y=9, reached.\n\nBut this takes longer: from t=14 y=6, we stayed at t=14 and t=15? Let's timeline.\n\nt=9: y=1\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\na10=U → t=11: y=3\n\na11=U → t=12: y=4\n\na12=U → t=13: y=5\n\na13=U → t=14: y=6\n\nNow at t=14, y=6\n\nWe want to go to y=7, but cannot at t=15 or t=16.\n\nSo at t=14, action a14: we can stay or go down, but going down delays more.\n\nIf a14=S, then t=15: y=6 (safe)\n\nThen at t=15, action a15: if U, then t=16: y=7, but t=16 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf a15=S, t=16: y=6\n\nThen a16=U, t=17: y=7 (safe, since t=17 not occupied)\n\nThen a17=U, t=18: y=8 (safe, t=18 not occupied)\n\na18=U, t=19: y=9\n\nReached at t=19.\n\nBut we started at t=9, reached at t=19, so K=19, t_1=9, K=t_1 + H -1=9 + H -1=19, so H-1=10, H=11? Let's count turns.\n\nAt turn t=19, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =19, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from a9 to a18, 10 actions.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we go faster to higher y and wait there.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 quickly, but y=6 is safe, but to go to y=7, we need to avoid t=15,16.\n\nWe can go to y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=2; but we can go up faster? From y=1 to y=2 at t=10, etc, same as before.\n\nAt t=14, y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=15? No, unsafe.\n\nUnless we go to y=7 before t=15.\n\nBut we are at t=14 y=6, we can only be at y=7 at t=15 or later, since from t=14, action U, t=15 y=7.\n\nWe cannot be at y=7 before t=15 if we are at y=6 at t=14.\n\nt=15 is the earliest we can be at y=7 from here.\n\nBut t=15 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we could have been slower to reach y=6.\n\nFor example, if we stay at lower y longer, then go up after t=16.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 quickly, before t=15.\n\nFor example, can we be at y=8 by t=14?\n\nStart t=9 y=1\n\na9=U → t=10 y=2\n\na10=U → t=11 y=3\n\na11=U → t=12 y=4\n\na12=U → t=13 y=5\n\na13=U → t=14 y=6? t=13 y=5, a13=U, t=14 y=6.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=14, we need to be at y=7 at t=13 or something.\n\nAt t=9 y=1\n\nIf we could go faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo from y=1 to y=8, minimum 7 moves: to y2,t10; y3,t11; y4,t12; y5,t13; y6,t14; y7,t15; y8,t16.\n\nBut t15 y7 unsafe, t16 y8 unsafe.\n\nWe cannot be at y=7 before t=15 if we start from y=1 at t=9.\n\nt=9 y=1\n\nt=10 y=2\n\nt=11 y=3\n\nt=12 y=4\n\nt=13 y=5\n\nt=14 y=6\n\nt=15 y=7 (earliest, but unsafe)\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=8 before t=16? At t=16 we can be y=8, but unsafe.\n\nThe safe times for y=7 and y=8 are t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nt<=14 means at or before t=14.\n\nCan we be at y=7 at t=14?\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we need to be at y=6 at t=13, then a13=U.\n\nAt t=13, y=6? How.\n\nt=9 y=1\n\na9=U t=10 y=2\n\na10=U t=11 y=3\n\na11=U t=12 y=4\n\na12=U t=13 y=5\n\nThen a13=U t=14 y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we need at t=13 y=6 or y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf at t=13 y=6, a13=U, t=14 y=7.\n\nIf at t=13 y=7, a13=S, t=14 y=7.\n\nBut at t=13, can we be at y=6?\n\nFrom above, at t=13 y=5, so not y=6.\n\nStart earlier: at t=9 y=1, we can only reach y=2 at t=10, y=3 at t=11, y=4 at t=12, y=5 at t=13, y=6 at t=14, y=7 at t=15 earliest.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=14, we need to start from higher y, but we start at y=1.\n\nUnless we go down, but going down doesn't help to be higher faster.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at y=7 or above before t=15.\n\nt=15 is the earliest possible for y=7.\n\nBut t=15 unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=16 earliest, unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or t=16, but since we must pass through them, we have to be on them at other times.\n\nThe next safe time is t=17 or later.\n\nSo we need to delay until t=17 to be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo from t=14 y=6, we stay at y=6 for a few turns until we can go up safely.\n\nAs I had earlier: stay at y=6 for t=14, t=15, t=16? Let's see.\n\nAt t=14 y=6 (safe)\n\na14=S → t=15 y=6 (safe)\n\na15=S → t=16 y=6 (safe)\n\nNow, at t=16, we can go to y=7: a16=U → t=17 y=7 (safe, since t=17 not occupied)\n\nThen a17=U → t=18 y=8 (safe)\n\na18=U → t=19 y=9\n\nReached at t=19.\n\nBut we can go earlier from t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, we go U to t=17 y=7.\n\nBut at t=17, we can go U again to t=18 y=8, etc.\n\nCan we reach y=7 at t=17 directly from lower.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at t=16.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=17, we need to be at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, we are at y=6, so we can go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=7 earlier than t=17? No, as we saw.\n\nUnless we are at higher y earlier, but impossible from start.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 or something, but y=0 might be safe, but we need to go to y=9, so going down delays.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo minimal time is to go up as fast as possible to y=6, which we reach at t=14, then stay there until t=16, then go up to y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=16, we are at y=6, and we go U at t=16 to y=7 at t=17.\n\nWe could go up at t=15 from y=6.\n\nAt t=15, if we are at y=6, we can go U to y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we go D, to y=5 at t=16, then later go up, but that takes more time.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is best.\n\nNow, we reached at t=19.\n\nBut H: t_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =19, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from a9 to a18, 10 actions.\n\nBut we might be able to save time by going to y=8 or y=9 directly, but no, must go step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at some point, we can be on y=7 or y=8 before t=15, but as we saw, impossible from start.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but we start at t=9.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but it doesn't help to reach y=9 faster.\n\nSo I think t=19 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times.\n\nFor y=7, unsafe at t=15,16.\n\nt=17 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, is there any other constraint?\n\nWhat about freeway 1? But y=1 is always safe.\n\nIn the path above, from t=9 to t=13, we go up to y=5 at t=13? Let's list positions:\n\nt=9: y=1\n\na9=U → t=10: y=2\n\nt=10: y=2, is it occupied? y=2 occupied only at t=9, not t=10, so safe.\n\nt=11: y=3, not occupied (only t=9), safe.\n\nt=12: y=4, safe\n\nt=13: y=5, safe? y=5 occupied only t=9, not later, safe.\n\nt=14: y=6, safe\n\nThen t=15: y=6 (after a14=S)\n\nt=15: y=6, safe\n\nt=16: y=6 (after a15=S)\n\nt=16: y=6, safe\n\nThen a16=U → t=17: y=7\n\nt=17: y=7, not occupied (only 9,15,16), so safe\n\na17=U → t=18: y=8\n\nt=18: y=8, not occupied, safe\n\na18=U → t=19: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we used 10 actions: from a9 to a18.\n\nBut the number of turns H: from turn t_1=9 to turn t_1 + H -1 =19.\n\nSo 9 to 19 inclusive is 11 turns, but we are at position at each turn.\n\nAt turn 9: start, after actions up to a18, at turn 19 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence has actions from a9 to a18, which is 10 actions for H=10? Let's see the range.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for actions, a_{t1 + t}\n\nt=0: a_{9+0}=a9\n\nt=1: a10\n\n...\n\nt=9: a_{18} if H=10, t=0 to 9, actions at 9 to 18.\n\nThen after a18, turn 19, y=9.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9 + 10 -1} = y_{18}, but we are at y=9 at turn 19, not turn 18.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 18, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 18, y=8, then a18=U, turn 19 y=9.\n\nSo at turn 18, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we want at turn 18 to be y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn K.\n\nIn the above, at turn 19 y=9.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at turn 18?\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 18, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at turn 17.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=8, a17=U, turn 18 y=9.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=9, a17=S, turn 18 y=9.\n\nNow, can we be at y=8 at turn 17?\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 17, need to be at y=7 or y=8 at turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7 or y=8 are unsafe, occupied.\n\nt=16, y=8 occupied, y=7 occupied.\n\nSo if at turn 16, we are on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 17, we need to be on y=8 at turn 16 or y=7 at turn 16 with action S or U? If at turn 16 y=7, a16=U, turn 17 y=8.\n\nBut at turn 16, if y=7, it is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 16 y=8, occupied.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at turn 16.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=8 at turn 17, because to be there, we must have been on y=7 or y=8 at turn 16, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at turn 17, we need to be on y=8 or y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at turn 16, y=9 safe but we are not there.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before turn 19.\n\nAt turn 18, to be at y=9, need on y=8 or y=9 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, if y=8, we can go to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 17, need on y=7 or y=8 at turn 16.\n\nBut turn 16 y=7 and y=8 unsafe, so impossible.\n\nThus, the earliest to be at y=9 is turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 17: to be y=9, need y=8 or y=9 at turn 16, unsafe or not possible.\n\nTurn 18: need y=8 or y=9 at turn 17.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=8, which requires at turn 16 on y=7 or y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=9, which requires at turn 16 on y=8 or y=9, similarly impossible.\n\nThus, indeed, turn 19 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnd we can achieve it as above.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to stay at y=6 for turns t=14,15,16.\n\nAt turn t=14,15,16 we are at y=6.\n\nt=14 y=6 after action a13=U? Let's list the actions and positions clearly.\n\nTurn t | position y_t | action a_t | next y\n\nStart: turn 9, y=1\n\nAction a9: let's say U, so y_{10} = 1 +1 =2\n\nThen turn 10, y=2, action a10=U, y11=3\n\nTurn 11, y=3, a11=U, y12=4\n\nTurn 12, y=4, a12=U, y13=5\n\nTurn 13, y=5, a13=U, y14=6\n\nNow turn 14, y=6, we need to stay or something.\n\nTo avoid going to y=7 at t=15, we stay at y=6.\n\nSo a14=S, then y15=6\n\nTurn 15, y=6, action a15=S, y16=6\n\nTurn 16, y=6, action a16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17, y=7, action a17=U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18, y=8, action a18=U, y19=9\n\nNow, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which should be turn 19.\n\nt1 + H -1 =19\n\n9 + H -1 =19, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe actions are from a9 to a18, which is 10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1=10-1=9? H=11, t from 0 to 10? Let's see.\n\nt1 + H -1 =19, H=11.\n\nActions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 = t=0 to 10.\n\nt=0: a_{9+0}=a9\n\nt=1: a10\n\n...\n\nt=9: a_{18}\n\nt=10: a_{19}? t=0 to 10, that's 11 actions? t from 0 to 10 inclusive is 11 values.\n\nBut we only need actions up to a18 to reach turn 19.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{19} =9.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{19}, we go to y_{20}, but we don't care.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, but in this case, a9 to a_{19}? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nH-1 =10 for t=0 to 10, actions a9 to a19? But a19 is not needed.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet the actions be a_t for t = t1, t1+1, ..., up to the action that brings us to y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn the task: sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, in the above, we have actions a9 to a18, that's 10 actions, from t=0 to 9? Let's set.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t1), position y_{t1}\n\nAction a_{t1} (τ=0) → y_{t1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t1 + k} (τ=k) → y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nNow, after action a_{t1 + H -2}, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Not necessarily, because action a_{t1 + H -2} could be S or U or D.\n\nBut we want directly y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 19, y=9, which is t1 + H -1 =19, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nNow, the actions are for τ from 0 to H-1 =10, so τ=0 to 10, actions a_{9} to a_{19}.\n\nBut a_{19} is the action at turn 19, which affects y_{20}, but at turn 19 we are already at y=9, so we don't need to specify a_{19}, but the sequence includes actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nIn this case, for turn 19, we are at y=9, and we take action a_{19}, which could be S, for example, to stay, but we don't care what it is, as long as at that turn we are at 9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 19, we need to output an action, even if we are already at 9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 18, we are at y=8, a18=U to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, we can take a19=S, for example.\n\nBut we only need to reach at turn t1 + H -1=19.\n\nNow, with H=11, actions from a9 to a19.\n\nBut a19 can be S.\n\nIn the path, we have 11 actions, but the first 9 are to get to y=6, etc.\n\nIn my earlier, actions a9 to a18 are 10 actions to go from y=1 to y=9 in 10 steps with waiting.\n\nThen a19 is extra.\n\nLet's list the actions needed.\n\nTo have y19=9, we need actions from a9 to a18: a9 to a13: U (to go up to y6 at t14), then a14=S, a15=S, a16=U (to y7 at t17), a17=U (y8 t18), a18=U (y9 t19).\n\nActions: a9 to a18: 10 actions.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, we need to include a19 for the sequence up to t1+H-1=19.\n\na19 can be S, for example.\n\nSo actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=S\n\nNow, for collision: at each turn, when on freeway, not occupied.\n\nt=9: y=1, safe\n\nt=10: y=2, safe (not occ t=10)\n\nt=11: y=3, safe\n\nt=12: y=4, safe\n\nt=13: y=5, safe\n\nt=14: y=6, safe\n\nt=15: y=6, safe\n\nt=16: y=6, safe\n\nt=17: y=7, safe (t=17 not occ)\n\nt=18: y=8, safe\n\nt=19: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, H=11, since t1 + H -1=19, 9+11-1=19.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nBut can we reach earlier? We thought not.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nBut as before, impossible because to be at y=9 at turn 18, need to be on y=8 or y=9 at turn 17.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 17, need on y=7 or y=8 at turn 16, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have a19, but since we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there were multiple cars, but we handled the occupied times.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, we have cars at T=15 and 16, but not other times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times again.\n\nFor freeway 7: occupied at T=9,15,16.\n\nT=9: from car1 (6,-5,right,6), at T=9, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nT=15 and 16 from car3.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 same.\n\nOther freeways only T=9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we go directly up to y=6, then stay for two turns, then up to y=9.\n\nBut we can have other paths, but this should be minimal time.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 earlier if we start slower, but we start at y=1, cannot be at y=7 before t=15.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFrom turn 9 to turn 19, but actions for turn t to turn t1 + H -1 =19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: a9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a12 = U\n\nTurn 13: a13 = U\n\nTurn 14: a14 = S\n\nTurn 15: a15 = S\n\nTurn 16: a16 = U\n\nTurn 17: a17 = U\n\nTurn 18: a18 = U\n\nTurn 19: a19 = S  (since we are at y=9, we can stay, or U or D, but S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 19, we are at y=9, and we take action a19, which doesn't affect reaching, but we need to specify it.\n\nSince we reach at turn 19, and action at turn 19 is for future, but in the sequence, it must be included.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, since we are at 9 at turn 19, and H is fixed.\n\nWe could have reached at turn 19 with different actions, but this is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nH=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince t_1=9.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there were three cars, but we considered all.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 7, at T=9, occupied, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think correct.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9+10-1} = y_{18} =9.\n\nSo need to be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nThen, to be at y=9 at turn 18, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at turn 17.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=8, then a17=U to turn 18 y=9.\n\nIf at turn 17 y=9, a17=S, turn 18 y=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at turn 17, need at turn 16 on y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut turn 16, y=7 or y=8 are occupied, collision.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 17, need at turn 16 on y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at turn 16, y=9 safe but not reached.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at turn 18 with no collision.\n\nSimilarly for turn 17.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn 9 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars' positions and movements indicate that freeways y=2 to y=6 and y=7 to y=8 are occupied at x=0 at turn 9, but not at later turns except for y=7 and y=8, which are also occupied at turns 15 and 16.\n\nTo minimize the number of turns, the player should move up directly to y=6 by turn 14. However, moving to y=7 at turn 15 or y=8 at turn 16 would cause a collision, as these freeways are occupied at those turns. Therefore, the player must wait at y=6 for turns 15 and 16 to avoid the unsafe times on y=7 and y=8. After turn 16, y=7 and y=8 are safe, so the player can move up to y=7 at turn 17, y=8 at turn 18, and y=9 at turn 19.\n\nThis path reaches y=9 at turn 19, which corresponds to \\( t_1 + H - 1 = 19 \\) with \\( t_1 = 9 \\), so \\( H = 11 \\). The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 9, move up to y=2 (safe, as y=1 is not occupied at turn 9).\n- At turns 10 to 13, continue moving up to reach y=6 by turn 14 (all safe, as y=2 to y=6 are only occupied at turn 9, not later).\n- At turns 14 and 15, stay at y=6 to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at unsafe turns 15 and 16.\n- At turn 16, move up to y=7 (now safe, as turn 17 is not occupied).\n- At turn 17, move up to y=8 (safe).\n- At turn 18, move up to y=9 (reached).\n- At turn 19, the player is at y=9; the action is stay, but it does not affect reaching the goal.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\( H \\) is 11, and the action sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At each turn, when on a freeway (y=1 to y=8), x=0 is not occupied by any car at that turn.\n- Specifically, y=2 to y=6 are safe for turns ≥10, y=7 and y=8 are safe except at turns 9, 15, and 16 (avoided by waiting at y=6).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t=10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k, and for that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0. Also, when moving to a new freeway, you're not considered on that freeway until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars there at the current turn.\n\nThe car update rules: for each car, at turn t1=10, we have the head, tail, direction, and speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nLet me list out all the cars and their positions at t=10:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [37,48] at t=10. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Head and tail: in the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end, so span [tail, head] moves right.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1\n\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nFor direction right: head is the front when moving right, so head is the right end, tail is left end. So span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for direction left: head is the front when moving left, so head is left end, tail is right end? But in the update, for left-moving, it says [h, τ] and h decreases, τ decreases, so if h is head, and direction left, head should be the left point.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. Since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], at T [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the car state, (head, tail, direction, speed), I think \"head\" is the leading point, \"tail\" is trailing.\n\nSo for direction right, leading point is head, which is right, so head > tail, span [tail, head].\n\nFor direction left, leading point is head, which is left, so head < tail, span [head, tail].\n\nBut in the update for left-moving, it uses [h, τ], which might have h < τ or h > τ? It says [h, τ] for left-moving, and it moves left, so h and τ both decrease, so if it's left-moving, head should be smaller, tail larger? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps in the notation, head and tail are always defined such that for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so span [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is right, tail is left, span [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nBut in the update rule text:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere [h, τ] with h and τ, and both decrease, so for left-moving, h should be the left point, τ the right point, so head is h (left), tail is τ (right).\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo [τ, h] with τ and h, τ increases, h increases, so for right-moving, τ is left, h is right, so tail is τ (left), head is h (right).\n\nIn the car state table, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so:\n\n- For dir right: head is h (right end), tail is τ (left end), so span [tail, head] at t1.\n\n- For dir left: head is h (left end), tail is τ (right end), so span [head, tail] at t1.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving, based on the data. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37, dir=right, so since right-moving, tail=37 (left), head=48 (right), span [37,48] at t=10.\n\nFreeway 2: (12,1,right,6) — tail=1, head=12, span [1,12] at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5,6 same as freeway 2? No, let's see:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1: (48,37,right,12)\n\n2: (12,1,right,6)\n\n3: (12,1,right,6) — same as 2\n\n4: (12,1,right,6) same\n\n5: (12,1,right,6) same\n\n6: (12,1,right,6) same\n\n7: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) — three cars\n\n8: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) — same as 7\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so for each, span at t is [τ + s(t-10), h + s(t-10)] for t >=10.\n\nSince direction right.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T, so if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, and at turn T, for freeway k, the car's span includes 0.\n\nAlso, when the player moves, at turn T, they are on y_T, and they choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, they are still on y_T, so collision check is only for the current freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T. Only the freeway you are currently on matters for collision.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2) at t=10, so y_{10} = 2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9 without collision.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same), with y bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start at y=2, need to go up to y=9, so we need to increase y by 7, but we can go down or stay to avoid cars, but since we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, min steps if no cars is 7 steps up, but with cars, we might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=10 to t=10+H-1, so at turn t=10+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=10 to t=10+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAt turn t, we do action a_t, then move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nSo for example, at turn t=10, position is (0,2), we choose a_{10}, then at turn t=11, position is (0, y_{11}) = (0, y_{10} + Δy_{10}).\n\nSimilarly, collision at turn T: if at turn T, we are on y_T, and for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, and cars move on the x-axis, collision when car span includes x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, we need to know if x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at time t: [τ + s(t-10), h + s(t-10)] for each car.\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s(t-10) <= 0 <= h + s(t-10) for that car.\n\nSince τ and h are integers, I assume, speeds are integers, so positions are integers.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, (head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12) so at t, span: [37 + 12(t-10), 48 + 12(t-10)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12(t-10) <= 0 <= 48 + 12(t-10)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car (12,1,right,6) so [1 + 6(t-10), 12 + 6(t-10)]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6(t-10) <= 0 <= 12 + 6(t-10)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: same as freeway 2, since all have (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (12,1,right,6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4 same, etc. up to 6.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,6) so [1 + 6(t-10), 12 + 6(t-10)]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,6) so [37 + 6(t-10), 48 + 6(t-10)]\n\nThird car: (-30,-41,right,6) head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, so since right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span [tail + sΔt, head + sΔt] = [-41 + 6(t-10), -30 + 6(t-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as freeway 7: three cars identical.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 2 has a car: at t=10, span [1+0,12+0] = [1,12], which includes 0? 1 <= 0 <=12? 0 is not between 1 and 12, since 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]. Similarly, at t=10, for freeway 2, is it safe?\n\ny=2 at t=10, freeway 2, car span [1,12] at t=10, 0 not in [1,12] since min is 1>0, so no collision at t=10.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, once we reach, it's safe.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=3 to8 safely.\n\nNow, minimal H: if no cars, we can go UUUUUUUS? From y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up, so at t=10, y=2; t=11, y=3; ... up to t=17, y=9. So H=8 turns? Turns from t=10 to t=17, that's 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=10, position y=2, we do action, say U, then at t=11, y=3.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t=10+H, position y_{10+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9? No.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter performing a_{t1 + H -1}, the position becomes y_{t1 + H -1 +1} = y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, position is y_t, we do action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H is y_{t1+H}\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9, meaning before the action at that turn? No.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9), which means after the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, we are at y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_{t1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k}, at turn t1 + k +1, position y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1 + H -1\", y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nWhen we perform a_{t1 + H -1}, it determines y_{t1 + H -1 +1} = y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t1 + H -1, before any action, we are at y=9.\n\nFor that to happen, we must have reached y=9 by turn t1 + H -2 or something.\n\nLet's set t1=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=2.\n\nAfter action a10, at t=11, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAfter a11, at t=12, y12, and so on.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1 = 10 + H -1\n\nAnd we have actions a10 to a_{10 + H -2} to reach y_{10 + H -1} =9? I'm confused.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so for t=0, a_{t1}; t=1, a_{t1+1}; ... t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9, which is before the last action or after?\n\nPosition at turn t is before action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen we perform action a_{t1 + H -1}, which might move us, but we don't care, as long as at that turn we are at 9.\n\nBut the action at that turn could be S, U, or D, but since we are at 9, if we do U, we go to 10, but y=10 is invalid, since y=0 to9, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=9, U is invalid, similarly D to 8, or S.\n\nBut we can stay at 9.\n\nFor the position to be 9 at turn t1 + H -1, it means that by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, we have reached y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we perform a_{t1 + H -1}, which could be S to stay, or D to go down, but since we want to be at 9, probably S, but the action is part of the sequence.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we go up directly, from y=2 at t=10, after 7 ups, at t=17, y=9.\n\nt=10: y=2\na10=U, t=11: y=3\na11=U, t=12: y=4\n...\na16=U, t=17: y=9\n\nSo at turn t=17, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =17, so 9 + H =17, H=8.\n\nActions from a10 to a16, that's 7 actions? t from 0 to H-1, a10 to a10+H-1.\n\nH actions: a10 to a10+H-1.\n\nIn this case, to reach y9 at turn T, with T= t1 + H -1.\n\nFrom t=10 to T, number of turns passed is T-10.\n\nPosition changed from y10 to yT.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or+1.\n\nTo go from 2 to 9, net change +7, so min actions if all U is 7 actions, but after k actions, we are at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1+k} = y10 + sum of Δy.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=10, y10=2.\n\nAfter 1 action a10, at t=11, y11.\n\nAfter m actions, at t=10+m, y_{10+m}.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1.\n\nSo after (T - 10) actions, we are at y_T.\n\nNumber of actions from t=10 to before turn T is T-10.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 17, T=17, T-10=7 actions: a10 to a16, and y17=9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1, so 10 + H -1 = T, so H-1 = T-10, so number of actions is H, from a10 to a10+H-1, and y at turn 10+H-1 is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have H actions, and at the turn after the last action, we are at y=9? No.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, before action a_{t1 + H -1}, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we perform a_{t1 + H -1}, which changes to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position to be 9 at turn t1 + H -1, it must be that the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2} have brought us to y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} determine y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we perform a_{t1 + H -1}, which can be anything, but since we are at 9, a must be S or D, but D would go down, but we want to be at 9, so probably a_{t1 + H -1} should be S to stay, or if we do D, we leave, but the position at that turn is 9 only if we don't move away before, but at the turn, position is fixed before action.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1, we need that after the actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, we are at y_T =9.\n\nNumber of actions from t1 to T-1 is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nFor T = t1 + H -1, so T - t1 = H -1.\n\nSo we need H-1 actions to reach y_{t1 + H -1} =9 from y_{t1} =2.\n\nFrom y2 to y9, min steps is 7 with all U.\n\nSo min H-1 =7, so H=8, with actions a10 to a16, all U, reaching y17=9, but we want y_T=9 for T= t1 + H -1 =10+8-1=17, yes.\n\nWith cars, it might take more.\n\nBut in this case, at t=10, y=2, freeway 2 has car, but at t=10, span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=11, if we go to y=3, freeway 3, which has the same car as freeway 2, (12,1,right,6), at t=11, Δt=1, span [1+6(1),12+6(1)] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, up to y=8 at t=16, freeway 8 has cars, but let's see if we can go up directly.\n\nPlayer path: start at t=10, y=2.\n\nAction U: t=11, y=3\n\nU: t=12, y=4\n\nU: t=13, y=5\n\nU: t=14, y=6\n\nU: t=15, y=7\n\nU: t=16, y=8\n\nU: t=17, y=9\n\nNow, check collision at each turn when on freeway 1-8.\n\nAt t=10, y=2, freeway 2: car span at t=10: [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11, y=3, freeway 3: same car as freeway 2, at t=11, [1+6(1),12+6(1)] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12, y=4, freeway 4: same, at t=12, [1+12,12+12]= [13,24]? Δt=t-10, at t=12, Δt=2, [1+6*2,12+6*2]= [1+12,12+12]= [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t=13, y=5, freeway 5: at t=13, Δt=3, [1+18,12+18]= [19,30], no.\n\nt=14, y=6, freeway 6: at t=14, Δt=4, [1+24,12+24]= [25,36], no.\n\nt=15, y=7, freeway 7: now freeway 7 has three cars.\n\nAt t=15, Δt=5.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,6) span [1+6*5,12+6*5] = [1+30,12+30]= [31,42]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,6) span [37+30,48+30]= [67,78]\n\nThird car: (-30,-41,right,6) span [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0]\n\n[-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSo at t=15, on freeway 7, car 3 span [-11,0], includes 0, so collision if player is on y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut in our path, at t=15, y=7, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, y=8, freeway 8, same cars, at t=16, Δt=6.\n\nFirst car: [1+36,12+36]= [37,48]\n\nSecond: [37+36,48+36]= [73,84]\n\nThird: [-41+36, -30+36]= [-5,6], -5 <=0<=6, yes, 0 in span, collision.\n\nSo directly going up, at t=15 and t=16, when on y=7 and y=8, collision with the third car on those freeways.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go directly up in 7 steps; we need to delay or go down to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at those times.\n\nNow, let's find when each freeway is unsafe, i.e., when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince all freeways except 1 and 6 have similar cars, but freeway 1 is different.\n\nList for each freeway the times when it is unsafe (collision possible).\n\nFirst, for a freeway with a car, 0 in span at t if for some car, min <=0<= max.\n\nSince span [L(t), R(t)] with L(t) <= R(t), 0 in if L(t) <=0 and 0<=R(t), i.e., L(t) <=0 <= R(t).\n\nL(t) and R(t) linear in t.\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car, span L(t) = 37 + 12(t-10), R(t) = 48 + 12(t-10)\n\nUnsafe when L(t) <=0 <= R(t)\n\nL(t) = 37 +12(t-10) <=0 => 12(t-10) <= -37 => t-10 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so t <= 10 - 3.083 = 6.917, but t>=10, so L(t) =37 +12(t-10) >=37>0 for t>=10, so L(t)>0, thus 0 < L(t) <= R(t), so 0 not in [L,R] since min is positive. So for freeway 1, always safe for t>=10, because the car is at positive x moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4,5,6: each has one car (12,1,right,6), so L(t) =1 +6(t-10), R(t)=12+6(t-10)\n\nUnsafe when 1 +6(t-10) <=0 <=12+6(t-10)\n\nFirst, 1 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6Δt <= -1 => Δt <= -1/6, impossible for Δt>=0, so L(t) =1 +6(t-10) >=1>0 for t>=10, so always min >0, thus never unsafe. So freeways 2,3,4,5,6 are always safe for t>=10.\n\nBut earlier for y=2 at t=10, [1,12] min=1>0, yes safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each, and the third car can cause unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7: cars:\n\nCar1: same as above, (12,1,right,6), L1(t)=1+6(t-10), R1(t)=12+6(t-10) >0 always, so never unsafe from this car.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,6), L2(t)=37+6(t-10), R2(t)=48+6(t-10) >=37>0, always min>0, never unsafe.\n\nCar3: (-30,-41,right,6), head=-30, tail=-41, so for right-moving, span [tail + sΔt, head + sΔt] = [-41 +6(t-10), -30 +6(t-10)]\n\nSet L3(t) = -41 +6(t-10), R3(t) = -30 +6(t-10)\n\nUnsafe when L3(t) <=0 <= R3(t)\n\nL3(t) <=0: -41 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so t-10 <=6.833, t<=16.833, so t<=16 since integer.\n\n0 <= R3(t): 0 <= -30 +6Δt => 6Δt >=30 => Δt >=5, t>=15\n\nSo unsafe when t>=15 and t<=16, since t integer.\n\nFor t=15 and t=16.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nSo freeway 7 is unsafe at t=15 and 16.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=15 and 16.\n\nNow freeway 1 to 6 are always safe.\n\nPlayer needs to go from y=2 to y=9, but y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=15 and 16.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 or y=8 only when safe, but they are only unsafe at t=15,16, so if we are not on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or 16, it should be fine.\n\nBut we have to pass through them at some point.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are unsafe only at t=15 and 16, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, freeway 7: at t=14, Δt=4, car3: L3= -41 +6*4 = -41+24= -17, R3= -30+24= -6, so [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly at t=17, Δt=7, L3= -41+42=1, R3= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in since min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSo freeway 7 safe except t=15,16.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, min time.\n\nStart at t=10, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to higher y.\n\nSince y=2 to6 are always safe, we can go up quickly to y=6 or something.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=15,16, so if we can be on y=7 before t=15 or after t=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=15 and 16 are specific turns.\n\nWe can stay at lower y to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSince we want min H, we should try to reach as fast as possible.\n\nFirst, if no issue, we can be at y=9 by t=17 with 7 ups.\n\nBut at t=15, if on y=7, collision; t=16 on y=8 collision.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 at t=15, not on y=8 at t=16? But at t=16, y=8 is unsafe, but we might not be on it.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Delay the ascent: stay at lower y until after t=16, then go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\n2. Go up faster to be on y=7 before t=15, but t=15 is the first unsafe time, before that safe.\n\nAt t=14, freeway 7 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at t=17, safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=14 or earlier, or at t=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=14: freeway 8 at t=14, safe, as above.\n\nt=17, safe.\n\nNow, from start, at t=10, y=2.\n\nIf we go up immediately, we can be at y=7 at t=15? From t=10 y=2 to y=7, need +5, so min at t=15 if start at t=11 y=3? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nAfter action, at t=11, y=3 (if U)\n\nt=12, y=4\n\nt=13, y=5\n\nt=14, y=6\n\nt=15, y=7 — but t=15 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so we cannot reach y=7 before t=15 from y=2 at t=10.\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nt=11: y=3 (after U)\n\nt=12: y=4\n\nt=13: y=5\n\nt=14: y=6\n\nt=15: y=7 — earliest possible to be at y=7 is t=15, but unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=14, we need to be at y=6 at t=13? At t=14, position y=7, which means at turn t=14, we are at y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, we must have been at y=6 at t=13 and done U, or at y=7 and done S, or y=8 and done D, but since we are coming from below, probably U from y=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=14, we need at t=13, y=6, then a13=U, then at t=14, y=7.\n\nAt t=13, y=6: possible? From start, t=10 y=2, to y=6 at t=13: need +4 in 3 steps, possible with U,U,U: t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5? t=10 y=2, a10=U, t=11 y=3; a11=U, t=12 y=4; a12=U, t=13 y=5; then to y=6 at t=14: a13=U, t=14 y=6? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTo have y_t = k at turn t.\n\nFor y=6 at turn t=13: possible with actions from t=10 to t=12.\n\ny10=2\n\na10: to y11\n\na11: to y12\n\na12: to y13\n\nWe want y13=6.\n\nSince y10=2, need net +4 in 3 actions, so all U: a10=U, y11=3; a11=U, y12=4; a12=U, y13=5. y13=5, not 6.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=13, we need y13=6, which requires y12=5 or 6 or 7.\n\nIf y12=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\ny12=6, a12=S, y13=6\n\ny12=7, a12=D, y13=6\n\nBut to have y12=5,6, or7.\n\nEarliest to have high y: from y10=2, after 2 actions: at t=12, y12 could be 2,3,4 (if U,U: y12=4; U,D: y12=2; etc, max y12=4)\n\ny10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\nThen a12=U, y13=5\n\nCannot have y13=6 because from y10=2, in 3 actions, max increase +3, to y=5 at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, min to y= -1, but invalid.\n\nSo at t=13, y <=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, y <=6: y10=2, after 4 actions, max y=6 at t=14.\n\ny10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\nYes.\n\nAt t=15, y<=7, etc.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14: not possible, since at t=14, max y=6.\n\nAt t=14, y14 <= y10 +4 =6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, y15 <=7.\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nWe can be at y=7 at t=17 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\nSince we cannot be on y=7 at t=15 or t=16, and we must pass through y=7 at some point.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe unsafe times are only t=15 and 16 for y=7 and 8.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=14, or t=17, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAt t=14, we can be at y=6, as above.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=14, if we go U, to y=7 at t=15, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not go to y=7 at t=15.\n\nOptions: at t=14, y=6, we can do S, stay at y=6 for t=15, or D to y=5, or U to y=7 but unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=14, then at t=15, y=6 (since a14=S, y15=6)\n\nThen on freeway 6 at t=15, which is safe, as freeway 6 always safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we are at y=6, we can do U to y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7: freeway 7 at t=16 is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nIf at t=15, y=6, we do U, a15=U, then at t=16, y=7.\n\nBut freeway 7 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nIf we do D at t=14, to y=5 at t=15, etc., but that might delay more.\n\nWe need to reach y=7 after t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=17 or later.\n\nNow, from start, we can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nt=10: y=2, a10=U, t=11: y=3\n\na11=U, t=12: y=4\n\na12=U, t=13: y=5\n\na13=U, t=14: y=6\n\nNow at t=14, y=6, safe.\n\nWe cannot go to y=7 at t=15 because unsafe.\n\nSo at t=14, we must not do U; instead, do S or D.\n\nIf we do S at t=14: a14=S, then at t=15, y=6 (still)\n\nNow at t=15, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at t=16: a15=U, t=16: y=7\n\nBut at t=16, freeway 7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we do D at t=14: a14=D, then at t=15, y=5\n\nThen at t=15, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nBut now we are lower.\n\nThen to go up, need more steps.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=16, we need to not be on y=7 at that turn.\n\nSince we want min time, better to wait at y=6 until t=16 is over.\n\nt=16 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nUnsafe times for y=7 are t=15 and 16.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at t<=14 or t>=17.\n\nBut t<=14, we can be at y=7 at t=14? Earlier we saw at t=14, max y=6, so cannot be at y=7 until t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=7 is possible but unsafe.\n\nSo earliest possible to be at y=7 safely is at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, freeway 7 safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9.\n\nWe can be at y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen we need to wait until after t=16 to go to y=7.\n\nSo at t=14, y=6, we can do S to stay at y=6 for t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=6, we can do S to stay for t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, then at t=16, we can do U to go to y=7 at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, y=7, freeway 7 safe, as at t=17, car3 span [ -41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 at t=18, etc.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nt=10: y=2\n\na10=U, t=11: y=3\n\na11=U, t=12: y=4\n\na12=U, t=13: y=5\n\na13=U, t=14: y=6\n\nNow at t=14, y=6\n\nInstead of going up, we stay: a14=S, then t=15: y=6\n\na15=S, t=16: y=6\n\nNow at t=16, y=6, we do U: a16=U, t=17: y=7\n\nAt t=17, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a17=U, t=18: y=8\n\nAt t=18, y=8, freeway 8: at t=18, Δt=8, car3: L3= -41+48=7, R3= -30+48=18, [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a18=U, t=19: y=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at which turn are we at y=9? At t=19.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1\n\nSo 10 + H -1 =19, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions: from a10 to a_{10+H-1} = a_{19}, but we have actions up to a18 to reach y19=9.\n\nIn this sequence, actions: a10 to a18.\n\na10: U, to y11=3\n\na11: U, to y12=4\n\na12: U, to y13=5\n\na13: U, to y14=6\n\na14: S, to y15=6\n\na15: S, to y16=6\n\na16: U, to y17=7\n\na17: U, to y18=8\n\na18: U, to y19=9\n\nSo actions from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions.\n\nNow, T = t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =19, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut number of actions is H, from a10 to a_{10+H-1} = a_{19}? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=19, y=9, so t1 + H -1 =19, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =19, H=10.\n\nThen actions a_{10} to a_{10+10-1} = a_{19}.\n\nBut in our actions, we have a10 to a18, which is 9 actions, missing a19.\n\nProblem: we need to have action at turn t=19 as well? But at turn t=19, we are already at y=9, and we perform a_{19}, which can be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, we must specify actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nFor H=10, actions a10 to a19.\n\nAt t=19, we are at y=9, and we do a19, say S, to stay at y=9 for t=20, but we don't care, as long as at t=19, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a19 is included, but it doesn't change the position at t=19.\n\nIn this case, with the above, we can set a19=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we have 10 actions.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=19 with a18=U from y=8.\n\nNow, can we do better with fewer turns?\n\nH=10, but min without cars is H=8 with y=9 at t=17.\n\nWith cars, we added two waits at y=6.\n\nBut we might be able to avoid waiting or go faster.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=7 at t=17 directly, but from y=6 at t=14, if we wait, we go to y=7 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=14, we are at y=6, we could go down to lower y and come back, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=6, we could go D to y=5 at t=15, then at t=15, y=5, we can go U to y=6 at t=16, then U to y=7 at t=17, same as before but with extra down and up, worse.\n\nOr, we could go up to y=6 later, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=1 to 6 are always safe, we can stay there.\n\nBut to min time, better to go up fast to y=6 and wait.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother point: we could be on y=8 at safe time.\n\nFor example, at t=14, if we could be at y=8, but at t=14, max y=6, impossible.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is t=16: y10=2, t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7 (unsafe), t=16 y=8 (unsafe if on).\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nOr at t=17: y=8 possible.\n\nIn our sequence, we go to y=8 at t=18.\n\nCan we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, after waiting at y=6 until t=16, we go to y=7 at t=17, then to y=8 at t=18, to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=17, y=7, we could go directly to y=9? No, only one step per turn, so to y=8 at t=18, then to y=9 at t=19.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo from y=7 at t=17, to y=9 at t=19, two steps: t=18 y=8, t=19 y=9.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 at t=18, which is safe, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach a higher y earlier by not going up so fast initially, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=2 for some turns, then go up, but that would take more time to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=2 for one turn: t=10 y=2, a10=S, t=11 y=2\n\nThen go up: a11=U, t=12 y=3\n\na12=U, t=13 y=4\n\na13=U, t=14 y=5\n\na14=U, t=15 y=6\n\nNow at t=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7, but at t=16 if we go, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at y=6 for t=16: a15=S, t=16 y=6\n\nThen a16=U, t=17 y=7\n\na17=U, t=18 y=8\n\na18=U, t=19 y=9\n\nSame as before, but we started later, so reached at same time or later.\n\nIn this case, we have an extra S at t=10, so we reach y=9 later? t=19 same.\n\nBut we have more actions.\n\nIn first sequence, we had a10 to a18: 9 actions to reach y=9 at t=19, but with H=10 including a19.\n\nIn terms of turns, we reach at t=19.\n\nWith the stay at start, we have a10=S, so at t=11 still y=2, then up, so to y=6 at t=15 instead of t=14, then same from there, reach y=9 at t=19 still, but with one extra action? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=2, a10=S, t=11: y=2\n\na11=U, t=12: y=3\n\na12=U, t=13: y=4\n\na13=U, t=14: y=5\n\na14=U, t=15: y=6\n\na15=S, t=16: y=6\n\na16=U, t=17: y=7\n\na17=U, t=18: y=8\n\na18=U, t=19: y=9\n\nSame as before but we started with S instead of U, so we are one step behind, but caught up? In first sequence without initial stay: at t=14 y=6, here at t=15 y=6, so we are one turn later, but in both cases y=9 at t=19? In first sequence: at t=14 y=6, t=15 y=6 (after S), t=16 y=6 (after S), t=17 y=7, etc. to t=19 y=9.\n\nIn this sequence with initial S: at t=15 y=6, t=16 y=6, t=17 y=7, same as above from t=15.\n\nBut in first sequence, we had y=6 at t=14,15,16; here y=6 at t=15,16 only, but reached y=9 at same t=19.\n\nBut with initial S, we have an extra action, but H is the same since we reach at same turn.\n\nt1 + H -1 =19, H=10 in both cases.\n\nBut in the sequence with initial S, we have a10=S, which is not necessary, so the first sequence is better with no waste.\n\nBut we can reduce H by not waiting or something.\n\nAnother idea: instead of waiting at y=6, we could go to y=5 or lower during the unsafe times, but since we need to go up, it might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=6, instead of S, we go D to y=5 at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can go U to y=6 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, we go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=18, U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSame as before, but we did extra down and up, so same time, more actions potentially, but H same.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nWe could go to y=7 at t=17 directly from y=6 at t=16.\n\nBut we need to be at y=6 at t=16 to go U at t=16 to y=7 at t=17.\n\nIn the waiting sequence, we are at y=6 at t=16.\n\nNow, to reach earlier, but we cannot be on y=7 before t=17 safely.\n\nUnless we are on y=7 at t=14, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can skip y=7 or something, but no, we have to go through each y.\n\nAnother thought: y=9 is safe, so once we reach, we are fine.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and go U.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=15,16, but safe at other times.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is t=16: y10=2, t=16 y=8 requires +6 in 6 steps: t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8. But y=7 at t=15 unsafe, and y=8 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nAt t=17: y=8 possible, as before.\n\nSo no earlier.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, we go up to y=6 by t=14, wait at y=6 for t=15 and t=16, then go up to y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nActions: a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, and for a19, since we need to include up to a_{19} for H=10, and at t=19 we are at y=9, we can do a19=S.\n\nSimilarly, we could do a19=U, but y=10 invalid, probably not allowed, or it might clamp, but in the update, y must be in [0,9], so if y=9 and U, probably not move or error, but to be safe, do S.\n\nThe problem says y_{t+1} \\in [0,9], so from y=9, U would be invalid, but we can assume it doesn't move or we should not do it.\n\nSo better to do S.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for freeway 1, we didn't use it, but it's always safe.\n\nFreeway 2-6 always safe.\n\nIn this path, we only used y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt t=10 y=2, safe; t=11 y=3 safe; ... t=14 y=6 safe; t=15 y=6 safe; t=16 y=6 safe; t=17 y=7 safe; t=18 y=8 safe; t=19 y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at an earlier turn? For example, t=18.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=18.\n\nThen y18=9.\n\nSince y10=2, in 8 actions (from a10 to a17), we need to go from y10=2 to y18=9, net +7 in 8 actions, possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=18, we need y18=9.\n\ny18=9 requires that at t=17, y=8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=8 at t=17, then a17=U, y18=9.\n\nIf y=9 at t=17, a17=S or D, but D to 8, then not 9.\n\nBut to have y=9 at t=18, we need to reach by a17.\n\nNow, to have y=8 at t=17: possible.\n\ny10=2, to y17=8, need +6 in 7 actions (a10 to a16).\n\nWith min 6 U, one S or something.\n\nBut y=8 at t=17: freeway 8 at t=17.\n\nt=17, Δt=7, freeway 8 car3: L3= -41 +6*7 = -41+42=1, R3= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars safe.\n\nSo y=8 at t=17 is safe.\n\nThen a17=U, y18=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=8 at t=17.\n\ny10=2 to y17=8 in 7 actions.\n\nPossible with, for example, 6 U and one S, or 7 U but max y=9, but to y=8.\n\nSince we need net +6, we can have 6 U and one S, or 7 U but if we go to y=9 earlier, but we need y=8 at t=17.\n\nFor example: start t=10 y=2\n\na10=U, t=11 y=3\n\na11=U, t=12 y=4\n\na12=U, t=13 y=5\n\na13=U, t=14 y=6\n\na14=U, t=15 y=7 — but at t=15, y=7 unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf we do S at some point to avoid.\n\nFor example, to not be at y=7 at t=15.\n\nAt t=14, y=6, if we do S, t=15 y=6\n\nThen a15=U, t=16 y=7 — but at t=16, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we do D at t=14, to y=5 at t=15, then a15=U, t=16 y=6, then a16=U, t=17 y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=17, we need y=7 at t=16 or y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut y=7 at t=16 unsafe, and y=8 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, to have y=8 at t=17, we must have been at y=7 at t=16 and done U, or at y=8 at t=16 and done S, or at y=9 at t=16 and done D.\n\nBut y=9 at t=16 impossible earlier.\n\nSo only way is from y=7 at t=16 with U to y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7 is on freeway 7, which is unsafe at t=16.\n\nThus, cannot be on y=7 at t=16 to go to y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=8 at t=16 and do S, but y=8 at t=16 unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=17 because it requires being on y=7 or y=8 at t=16, both unsafe.\n\nHence, cannot reach y=8 before t=17? At t=17, we can be at y=8, as in the first sequence.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, we can be from y=7 at t=16 with U, but t=16 y=7 unsafe; or from y=8 at t=16 with S, unsafe; or from y=9 with D, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible to be at y=8 is t=17, but only if we can reach it without being on unsafe positions.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=17, we need to be at y=7 at t=16, which is unsafe, so not possible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nAt t=17, position y=8.\n\nThis means at turn t=17, we are at y=8.\n\nTo be there, we must have arrived from previous: at t=16, position y=16, we do action a16, then y17 = y16 + Δy16.\n\nIf y17=8, then y16 must be 7,8, or9.\n\nIf y16=7, a16=U, y17=8\n\nIf y16=8, a16=S, y17=8\n\nIf y16=9, a16=D, y17=8\n\nBut at t=16, if y16=7, on freeway 7, unsafe; if y16=8, on freeway 8, unsafe; y16=9 not possible earlier.\n\nTherefore, at t=16, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8, so we cannot reach y=8 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=7 at t=17? To be at y=7 at t=17: from y16=6,7,or8.\n\ny16=6: a16=U, y17=7\n\ny16=7: a16=S, y17=7\n\ny16=8: a16=D, y17=7\n\nNow, y16=6: at t=16, freeway 6, safe.\n\ny16=7: unsafe\n\ny16=8: unsafe\n\nSo only possible from y16=6 with U to y17=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=17 not possible directly, but we can be at y=7 at t=17 from y=6 at t=16.\n\nThen from there to y=8 at t=18.\n\nIn our first sequence, that's what we did.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=18, we need y18=9, which requires y17=8 or9.\n\nBut y17=9 impossible early, or y17=8, which as above, cannot be at t=17 because requires unsafe position at t=16.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 before t=19.\n\nThus, minimal is at t=19 with H=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nt1=10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{11} = U\n\n...\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nFrom above:\n\na10 = U  // to y=3 at t=11\n\na11 = U  // to y=4 at t=12\n\na12 = U  // to y=5 at t=13\n\na13 = U  // to y=6 at t=14\n\na14 = S  // stay, y=6 at t=15\n\na15 = S  // stay, y=6 at t=16\n\na16 = U  // to y=7 at t=17\n\na17 = U  // to y=8 at t=18\n\na18 = U  // to y=9 at t=19\n\nNow, for H=10, we need up to a_{19}, since actions to t1 + H -1 =19.\n\na19: at t=19, y=9, we can do a19=S.\n\nSo the sequence has 10 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision avoidance.\n\nt=10: y=2, freeway 2, car: at t=10, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11: y=3, freeway 3, car at t=11: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12: y=4, freeway 4, [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no.\n\nt=13: y=5, freeway 5, [1+18,12+18]=[19,30], no.\n\nt=14: y=6, freeway 6, [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no.\n\nt=15: y=6, freeway 6, at t=15, [1+30,12+30]=[31,42], no.\n\nt=16: y=6, freeway 6, at t=16, [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], no.\n\nt=17: y=7, freeway 7, at t=17, car3: [-41+42, -30+42]=[1,12], 0 not in; other cars not near, safe.\n\nt=18: y=8, freeway 8, at t=18, car3: [-41+48, -30+48]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=19: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 at t=17, car3 [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this works.\n\nIs there a way with H=9?\n\nH=9 would mean y at t=10+9-1=18 is 9.\n\nBut as above, impossible because cannot reach y=9 at t=18 without being on unsafe freeway earlier.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to reach at t=18, we need y=8 at t=17 or something, not possible.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 9: a_{t_1 + 9} = S  (which is a19=S)\n\nt1=10, t1 + H -1 =10 +10-1=19, so actions from a10 to a19.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 9: a_{10+0} to a_{10+9} = a10 to a19.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut for the last action, it could be anything since we are at y=9, but S is fine.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we handled the third car.\n\nFreeway 1 has a car but always safe, not used.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, meaning the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 10 - 1 = 19\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by:\n- Moving up quickly to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 14, as freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are always safe for \\(t \\geq 10\\) (the cars on these freeways have spans that do not include \\(x = 0\\) at any \\(t \\geq 10\\)).\n- Waiting at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 15 and 16 to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 15\\) and \\(t = 16\\), when these freeways are unsafe due to the third car on each (span includes \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Proceeding up to \\(y = 9\\) from turn 17 onwards, as freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe for \\(t \\geq 17\\).\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 10**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11; freeway 2 is safe at \\(t = 10\\)).\n- **Turn 11**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12; freeway 3 is safe at \\(t = 11\\)).\n- **Turn 12**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13; freeway 4 is safe at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- **Turn 13**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14; freeway 5 is safe at \\(t = 13\\)).\n- **Turn 14**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 15; freeway 6 is safe at \\(t = 14\\)).\n- **Turn 15**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 16; freeway 6 is safe at \\(t = 15\\)).\n- **Turn 16**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17; freeway 6 is safe at \\(t = 16\\), and moving to \\(y = 7\\) avoids collision as the player is not on \\(y = 7\\) until turn 17).\n- **Turn 17**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18; freeway 7 is safe at \\(t = 17\\)).\n- **Turn 18**: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19; freeway 8 is safe at \\(t = 18\\)).\n- **Turn 19**: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\); no collision as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19 with no collisions. \\(H = 10\\) is minimal because:\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18 (which would require \\(H = 9\\)) is impossible without being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15 or 16, when collisions occur.\n- Any sequence with fewer than 10 turns either results in a collision or fails to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 11. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving only vertically on the y-axis from 0 to 9. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nThe challenge is to avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Cars are on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there are cars defined with their positions and movements.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway k (meaning y_T = k), and at that same turn T, for some car on that freeway, the x=0 point is within the car's span. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are only considered to be on y_T during turn T, not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So if they move, they only check for collision on the starting freeway at that turn, not the destination.\n\nNow, the car states at turn t_1=11:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (60, 49, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Head h=60, tail τ=49? The notation says (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which might be inconsistent.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1, it says (60, 49, right, 12). So for right-moving, at t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49, 60]? τ is tail, h is head? But in the description, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and moves left.\n\nIn freeway 1, (60,49, right,12), so I think h=60 is head, τ=49 is tail. Since right-moving, at t_1, span is from tail to head, so [49,60] at t_1=11.\n\nThen at turn T, span is [49 + 12(T-11), 60 + 12(T-11)]\n\nCollision if player is on freeway 1 at turn T and 0 ∈ [49 + 12(T-11), 60 + 12(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, freeways 2 to 6 each have one car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1=11, span is [τ, h] = [7,18]? Since (head, tail) is given as (18,7), and direction right, so tail=7, head=18? But in notation, it's (h,τ,d,s), so h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [7,18] at t_1=11.\n\nThen at T, span is [7 + 6(T-11), 18 + 6(T-11)]\n\nCollision if on freeway k at T and 0 in that span.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving with speed 6.\n\nFirst, I need to find when each car on each freeway has 0 in its span, meaning when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, collision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 ∈ span(T) for some car on k.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all for that freeway.\n\nThe player starts at y=3 at t_1=11.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up, but avoid the freeways when cars are present at x=0.\n\nSince we move one y per turn, from y=3 to y=9, minimum moves are 6 up actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, but going down might not help since we need to go up, and y=0 is safe I think, but goal is y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. Only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and collision only if on freeway k (y_T between 1 and 8) and car on that k has 0 in span at T.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nWe start at y=3, which is freeway 3, so we need to check if at t_1=11, on freeway 3, is there a car with 0 in span?\n\nSimilarly for each step.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each possible turn, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nDefine ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 11\n\nSo for a car on freeway k with given (h,τ,d,s), find when 0 ∈ span(T)\n\nSince all cars are right-moving in this case, d=right for all.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] where ΔT = T - 11\n\n0 ∈ [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSince τ and h, for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so the span is from τ to h increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nSo condition: τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n-τ / s ≥ ΔT ≥ -h / s ? Let's solve.\n\nτ + s ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSo from τ + s ΔT ≤ 0: s ΔT ≤ -τ, so ΔT ≤ -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s ΔT: s ΔT ≥ -h, so ΔT ≥ -h / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nAlso, since τ ≤ h, -τ/s ≥ -h/s, so the interval is ΔT ≥ ceil(-h/s) and ΔT ≤ floor(-τ/s)? Let's think in terms of integer turns.\n\nΔT is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo ΔT = T - 11, integer.\n\n0 ∈ [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] if τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSince τ and h integers, s integer, we can find integer ΔT satisfying.\n\nBut τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 and h + s ΔT ≥ 0.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: h=60, τ=49, s=12, d=right\n\nSo at ΔT, span [49 + 12 ΔT, 60 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSet 49 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 12 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ΔT ≤ -49 => ΔT ≤ -49/12 = -4.083, so ΔT ≤ -5? -49/12 = -4.083, so ΔT ≤ -4.083, since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -5\n\nΔT ≤ floor(-49/12) = floor(-4.083) = -5? -4.083, floor is -5? No.\n\nfloor(-4.083) is -5? Floor of -4.083 is -5? No, floor is the greatest integer less than or equal, so for -4.083, less than -4, so floor is -5? -4.083, integers less than: -5, -6, etc, greatest is -5? -5 = -5.0 < -4.083? -5.0 < -4.083 is true, but -4.083 is greater than -5.\n\nNumber line: -5, -4.083, -4\n\n-4.083 is between -5 and -4, closer to -4.\n\nFloor of -4.083: since it's negative, floor is -5? No, floor(-4.083) = -5? Let's think: floor(x) is greatest integer ≤ x.\n\nFor x = -4.083, integers ≤ -4.083 are -5, -6, -7, ..., greatest is -5? -5 = -5.0 < -4.083, yes, but -4 > -4.083? -4 = -4.0 > -4.083, so -4 is greater than -4.083, so not ≤. So integers ≤ -4.083 are -5, -6, etc., and -5 is greater than -6, so floor(-4.083) = -5.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-4.083) = -4.\n\nBut let's use inequalities.\n\n49 + 12 ΔT ≤ 0 => 12 ΔT ≤ -49 => ΔT ≤ -49/12 = -4.0833, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -5? -5 = -5.0 < -4.083? -5.0 is less than -4.083, so ΔT ≤ -5?

ΔT ≤ -5 and ΔT ≥ -5, so ΔT = -5\n\nThen for ΔT = -5, span: 49 +12*(-5) =49-60= -11, 60+12*(-5)=60-60=0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included, so at ΔT=-5, T=11 + (-5) =6, 0 is in span.\n\nBut we are at turn t_1=11, so for future turns ΔT >=0.\n\nΔT = T - 11, so for T >=11, ΔT >=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=11, span [49,60], 0 not in, since 49>0.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT>0, span larger and positive, so 0 never in span for freeway 1 car. Only at past turns, but for T>=11, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 2-6, each has one car: (18,7,right,6)\n\nh=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 +6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\nSet 7+6ΔT ≤0 ≤18+6ΔT\n\nFirst: 7+6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤ -7 => ΔT ≤ -7/6 ≈ -1.166, so ΔT ≤ -2? -7/6 = -1.166, ΔT ≤ -2 since integer? ΔT ≤ -1.166, so ΔT <= -2? Let's see.\n\nΔT <= floor(-7/6) = floor(-1.166) = -2\n\nSecond: 18+6ΔT >=0 => 6ΔT >= -18 => ΔT >= -3\n\nSo ΔT >= -3 and ΔT <= -2\n\nΔT >= ceil(-18/6) = ceil(-3) = -3\n\nΔT <= floor(-7/6) = floor(-1.166) = -2\n\nSo for ΔT = -2 and ΔT = -3\n\nAt ΔT=-3, span: 7+6*(-3)=7-18=-11, 18-18=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=-2, 7+6*(-2)=7-12=-5, 18-12=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=-1, 7-6=1, 18-6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFor T>=11, ΔT>=0, span [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT] >= [7,18] >0, so 0 never in. So no collision on freeways 2-6 for T>=11.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) same as above, no issue for T>=11.\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6) h=54, τ=43, s=6\n\nSpan [43 +6ΔT, 54+6ΔT]\n\nSet 43+6ΔT <=0 <=54+6ΔT\n\n43+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -43 => ΔT <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, so ΔT <= -8? floor(-7.166)= -8\n\n54+6ΔT >=0 => 6ΔT >= -54 => ΔT >= -9\n\nSo ΔT from -9 to -8? ΔT >= -9 and ΔT <= -8\n\nAt ΔT=-9, 43-54= -11, 54-54=0, [-11,0]\n\nAt ΔT=-8, 43-48= -5, 54-48=6, [-5,6] include 0\n\nFor T>=11, ΔT>=0, span [43,54] and up, all positive, no 0.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,6) h=-24, τ=-35? Given as (head, tail) = (-24,-35), direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? Since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation, it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\nSet -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so ΔT <= 5\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >= 24 => ΔT >= 4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=5\n\nFor ΔT=4, span: -35 + 24 = -11? -35 + 6*4 = -35 + 24 = -11, -24 + 24 =0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4, T=11+4=15\n\nAt ΔT=4, -35 + 6*4 = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=5, -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=6, -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, at T=15 and T=16 (ΔT=4 and 5), 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same cars as freeway 7: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSo similarly, the first two cars no collision for T>=11, but the third car causes collision at T=15 and T=16 on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars, so on freeway 8, at T=15 and T=16, for the third car, 0 in span.\n\nNow, freeway 7 also has this car, so on freeway 7, at T=15 and T=16, collision possible if player is there.\n\nBut freeway 7 has this car, so same as above.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs for T>=11.\n\ny=1: no collision, as car only at past.\n\ny=2 to y=6: no collision for T>=11.\n\ny=7: collision at T=15 and T=16 due to the third car (-24,-35,right,6)\n\ny=8: collision at T=15 and T=16 due to same car.\n\ny=7 and y=8 both have the same third car causing issue at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, player starts at t=11, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, but at t=11, on freeway 3, is there collision? Freeway 3 has one car (18,7,right,6), at t=11, span [7,18], 0 not in, so no collision at start.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,4,5,6 no issues for any T>=11.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision only at T=15 and 16.\n\nBut only if player is on y=7 or y=8 at those turns.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, we need to move up 6 times, but we can stay or move down to adjust timing.\n\nSince the only danger is on y=7 and y=8 at t=15 and 16, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 exactly at turns 15 or 16.\n\nAt other times, y=7 and y=8 are safe, since no other cars cause issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways are always safe.\n\nNow, player actions: at each turn, choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, with y bounded 0 to 9.\n\nStart: turn t=11, y=3.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go straight up, U each turn, then:\n\nTurn 11: y=3, action? Let's see sequence.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is (0, y_T), and action a_T is chosen, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, we are on y_T, and collision check based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn T, we have y_T and action a_T for that turn.\n\nStart: at turn t=11, y_11 = 3.\n\nWe choose a_11, then y_12 = y_11 + Δy_11, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 for some H, meaning after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1, with actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and position after actions should be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions? Indices: t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action? No.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and we choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nFor turn T, we are at y_T, then choose a_T, then move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAt turn T, collision is checked based on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last turn, at turn t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we perform action a_{t_1 + H -1}, but since we are at y=9, and action might change it, but we want to be at y=9 at that turn, so probably we don't move or something, but y=9 is safe, so we can stay or whatever, but the position is at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nAfter action, we move to next y, but for the turn when we are at y=9, we need to be there at that turn.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 at turn T, then at turn T, position is (0,9), and we can choose action, but if we choose U, y_{T+1}=10, but y max 9, so not allowed, or D to 8, but we are at 9 at turn T.\n\nThe state is defined at integer turns.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 with y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, need to increase by 6, so minimum 6 moves up, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid bad times.\n\nIn this case, the only bad times are on y=7 and y=8 at t=15 and 16.\n\nSpecifically, if at turn T=15 or 16, y_T =7 or y_T=8, then collision, because on freeway 7 or 8 with car covering x=0.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are only dangerous at T=15 and 16; at other times, safe.\n\nOther freeways always safe for T>=11.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=11, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn from start: let τ = T - 11, so at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need y_τ at τ relative.\n\nSet t_relative = T - 11, so at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=0 to some H-1, such that at turn t= H-1, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt absolute turn T, with T = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t is index.\n\nBetter to use relative time.\n\nDefine k = T - t_1, so at k=0, turn t_1=11, y=3.\n\nThen at turn k, position y_k.\n\nAction a_k chosen, then y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nWe need for some M, at turn M, y_M =9.\n\nThen H = M +1? Since from k=0 to k=M, there are M+1 turns? Turns from k=0 to k=M, that's M+1 turns.\n\nActions: at each turn k, we do action a_k, for k from 0 to M, but after M actions? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions? Actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + t is y_{t_1 + t}.\n\nAfter the last action at turn t_1 + (H-1), the position at that turn is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nSo at relative time, let k = t, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt each k, we have position y_k, and choose action a_k.\n\nThen y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nAt k=0, y_0 =3.\n\nAt k=H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\ny_k is position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe need to find minimal H and actions a_0 to a_{H-1} such that y_{H-1} =9, and no collision at any turn from k=0 to k=H-1.\n\nCollision at turn k if y_k between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, at time t_1 + k, 0 in some car span.\n\nt_1 + k is the absolute turn.\n\nIn terms of relative k, absolute turn T = 11 + k.\n\nNow, collision possible only if y_k =7 or y_k=8 and T=15 or 16, i.e., 11 + k =15 or 16, so k=4 or k=5.\n\nBecause T=15 when k=4 (since 11+4=15), T=16 when k=5 (11+5=16).\n\nAnd only for y_k=7 or 8.\n\nFor other y_k or other times, no collision.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, we must not have (y_k=7 and k=4) or (y_k=7 and k=5) or (y_k=8 and k=4) or (y_k=8 and k=5).\n\nThat is, at k=4, y_4 should not be 7 or 8.\n\nAt k=5, y_5 should not be 7 or 8.\n\nOtherwise, for all other k and positions, safe.\n\nNow, we start at k=0, y_0=3.\n\nWe need to reach y_{H-1}=9 for some H.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn, so from y=3 to y=9, the minimal k to reach y=9 is at least 6, since we need to increase by 6.\n\nIf we go straight up, U each turn:\n\nk=0: y=3, action U, then y1=4\n\nk=1: y=4, action U, y2=5\n\nk=2: y=5, action U, y3=6\n\nk=3: y=6, action U, y4=7\n\nBut at k=4, y4=7, and k=4 corresponds to T=15, which is bad, collision on freeway 7.\n\nThen at k=4, y=7, action say U, y5=8\n\nBut at k=5, y5=8, T=16, collision on freeway 8.\n\nThen continue, but we have collision.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nWe need to delay or advance so that at k=4 and k=5, we are not on y=7 or 8.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Be below y=7 at k=4 and k=5\n\n- Or above y=8 at k=4 and k=5, but y=8 is freeway, y=9 is safe.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, so if y_k=9, no collision.\n\nSimilarly y=0.\n\nAt k=4, if y_4 <=6 or y_4=9\n\nAt k=5, if y_5 <=6 or y_5=9\n\nBut y_5=9 is fine.\n\nNow, from start, we can go slower or faster.\n\nMinimal time: if no obstacles, H-1=6, so at k=6, y=9, but k from 0 to H-1, at k=H-1=6, y=9.\n\nBut with k=4 and k=5 being critical.\n\nIn the straight path, at k=4, y=7, bad.\n\nWe need to arrive later or earlier.\n\nIf we go straight but slower.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay or go down to waste time.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so we want to reach as soon as possible, but with constraint.\n\nFirst, what is the earliest we can reach y=9.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible, U every turn, then:\n\nAfter 0 actions: k=0, y=3\n\nAfter 1 U: k=1, y=4\n\nAfter 2 U: k=2, y=5\n\nAfter 3 U: k=3, y=6\n\nAfter 4 U: k=4, y=7 → but at k=4, y=7, T=15, collision\n\nThen after 5 U: k=5, y=8, T=16, collision\n\nAfter 6 U: k=6, y=9, safe, but we had collisions at k=4 and k=5.\n\nWe need to avoid those collisions.\n\nSo we must not be at y=7 or 8 at k=4 or k=5.\n\nk=4 and k=5 are fixed times relative to start.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some M, with M = H-1.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, but we have to pass through y=7 and 8, but at safe times.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are only dangerous at k=4 and k=5, which are early.\n\nk=4 is at T=15, only 4 turns after start.\n\nSince we start at y=3, to reach y=7, we need at least 4 steps up, so at k=4, if we go up all the time, y=7, which is bad.\n\nBut we can be lower at k=4.\n\nFor example, if we stay or go down at some point.\n\nBut that would make us reach y=9 later, increasing H.\n\nWe could be higher earlier, but from y=3, we can't be above y=7 at k=4 except by going up, but max we can be is y=7 if all U, or less.\n\nAt k=4, max y is min(9, 3+4) =7, since we start at 3, after 4 steps, y<=6 if we don't go up all, but if all U, y=7.\n\ny=7 at k=4 is possible, but bad.\n\nWe can have y=6 at k=4, for example by not going up one time.\n\nBut then we reach y=9 later.\n\nSimilarly, we could go down to waste time, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, we can go directly to y=9 before k=4, but is it possible?\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=3, need 6 steps up.\n\nAt k=0, y=3\n\nAfter 6 U actions, at k=6, y=9.\n\nBut k=6 is turn T=11+6=17.\n\nAt k=4, T=15, and k=5, T=16, which are before.\n\nBut if we can reach y=9 earlier? No, because 6 steps needed, so earliest at k=6.\n\nk=6 is T=17.\n\nAt k=4, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly k=5.\n\nIn the minimal path, at k=4, if we are below 7, say y=6, then we can go up later.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time.\n\nWe need to define actions.\n\nFirst, to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at k=4 and k=5.\n\nSince k=4 and k=5 are consecutive, and y changes by at most 1, it's tricky.\n\nFor example, at k=4, if y_4 <=6, then at k=5, y_5 could be y_4 -1, y_4, or y_4 +1.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=9, but at k=4, y=9 only if we reached earlier, but impossible since min k=6 to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 max 7.\n\nSo possible y_4 values: from max(0,3-4) to min(9,3+4), so y_4 from 0 to 7.\n\nBut to avoid collision, y_4 should not be 7 or 8, but y_4=8 impossible, so y_4 <=6 or y_4=9 impossible, so y_4 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at k=5, y_5 should not be 7 or 8, so y_5 <=6 or y_5=9.\n\nNow, y_5=9 possible only if we reached by k=5, but from y=3 to y=9 in 5 steps? Need to increase by 6 in 5 steps, impossible, since each step +1 max, so after 5 steps, y <= 3+5=8, or less if down, so y_5 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, at k=5, y_5 <=8, and to avoid collision, y_5 must not be 7 or 8, so y_5 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at k=4, y_4 <=6.\n\nTherefore, to be safe, we must have y_4 <=6 and y_5 <=6.\n\nSince y_5 depends on y_4 and action.\n\nBut y_5 <=6 required.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 by some M.\n\nEarliest possible M: since we need net +6 in y, and we have to spend some turns not going up, but to minimize M, we should go up as much as possible, except we need y_4 <=6 and y_5 <=6.\n\nNow, at k=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to control y at k=4 and k=5.\n\nk=4 is after 4 actions, k=5 after 5 actions.\n\nPosition at k=4: after actions from k=0 to k=3? Let's see.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, we go to y_{k+1}.\n\nSo y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\ny_k is position at the beginning of turn k, or after action? Standard is: at turn k, we are at y_k, then choose a_k, then move to y_{k+1}.\n\nSo y_k is position at turn k.\n\nAt k=0, y_0=3.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nThen at k=1, position y_1, and so on.\n\nSo position y_k at relative turn k.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nNow, for k=4, y_4 must be <=6\n\nFor k=5, y_5 must be <=6\n\nNow, from start, y_0=3.\n\nTo have y_4 <=6, since we start at 3, after 4 steps, we can be from 3-4= -1 but bounded to 0, to 3+4=7, but we need <=6, so we must not go up all the time; we need at least one down or stay in the first 4 turns? Not necessarily, we could go up slower.\n\nSimilarly for y_5.\n\ny_5 <=6 required.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to increase by 6.\n\nThe critical points are at k=4 and k=5, where we must be <=6.\n\nSince we need to be <=6 at k=4 and k=5, and y=9 later, we can go up to y=6 by k=4, stay or move down at k=4 to keep y_5<=6, then after k=5, go up fast to y=9.\n\nNow, minimal time: we need to reach y=9 by M=H-1.\n\nIf we can be at y=6 at k=4, then at k=4, we can stay or go down, but to have y_5<=6, if we stay, y_5=6, or go down to 5, or up to 7 but not allowed, since y_5 must <=6.\n\nBut if we go up at k=4, y_5=7>6, not allowed.\n\nSo at k=4, if y_4=6, we must not go up, so we must choose S or D to have y_5<=6.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4<6, we can go up.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible before and after.\n\nSo, from k=0 to k=3, we need to reach y_4 <=6.\n\nSince we start at 3, to have y_4=6, we need net +3 in 4 steps, which is easy.\n\nFor example, go up three times and stay once, or up four times but we can't since y_4=7>6 not allowed.\n\ny_4 must be <=6, so we cannot have four ups in first four actions.\n\nActions: from k=0 to k=3, we perform four actions to set y_4.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i\n\ny_0=3\n\nEach Δy_i is -1,0,+1 depending on action.\n\ny_4 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i\n\nWe need y_4 <=6, so sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i <=3\n\nBut since max per step +1, min -1.\n\nTo have y_4 as high as possible but <=6, so y_4=6 is best.\n\nSo we want sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i =3, so y_4=6.\n\nThen at k=4, since y_4=6, we must not go up, so we choose S or D to have y_5 <=6.\n\nIf S, y_5=6; if D, y_5=5.\n\nThen at k=5, y_5 must be <=6, which it is.\n\nThen after that, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny_5 <=6, and we need y_M=9 for some M.\n\nThe number of up actions needed depends on y_5.\n\nTo minimize M, we should maximize y_5, so at k=4, when y_4=6, we should choose S, so y_5=6, not D.\n\nThen y_5=6.\n\nThen from k=5 onwards, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny_5=6, need to increase to 9, so need +3, min 3 steps.\n\nSo at k=6, y=7; k=7, y=8; k=8, y=9.\n\nBut at k=6 and k=7, are there collisions?\n\nk=6 is T=11+6=17, k=7 is T=18.\n\nNow, at T=17 and 18, no cars at x=0 for any freeway, as we saw only at T=15,16 for y=7,8.\n\nSo at k=6, y=7, T=17, no collision, since no car at x=0 at that time.\n\nSimilarly k=7, y=8, T=18, safe.\n\nThen k=8, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about k=4 and k=5?\n\nk=4: y_4=6, which is freeway 6, but freeway 6 is always safe, no collision, as we checked earlier.\n\nk=5: y_5=6, same, safe.\n\nNow, we need to achieve y_4=6.\n\nAt k=0, y=3.\n\nAfter actions at k=0,1,2,3, we set y_4=6.\n\ny_4 = 3 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + Δy_2 + Δy_3\n\nWe need this sum to be 3, so Δy_0 + Δy_1 + Δy_2 + Δy_3 =3\n\nSince each Δy <=1, we need exactly three +1 and one 0, or other combinations, but to have sum=3, possible with three U and one S, or four U but that would be sum=4, y_4=7>6, not allowed.\n\nThree U and one S: sum of Δy = 3*1 + 0 =3, y_4=6.\n\nWe could have two U, two S, but sum Δy=2, y_4=5<6, which is also <=6, but then y_5 might be lower, but we can, but to minimize time, better to have y_4=6 so y_5=6, then we start from higher point.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=5, then at k=4 we can go up to y_5=6, but y_5=6 is allowed, then proceed.\n\nBut with y_4=5, we need one more step to reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf y_4=6, then after k=4, we do S at k=4, y_5=6\n\nThen U at k=5, y_6=7\n\nU at k=6, y_7=8\n\nU at k=7, y_8=9\n\nSo at k=8, y_8=9.\n\nH-1=8, so H=9? k from 0 to 8, that's 9 turns? Let's count.\n\nTurns: k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → 9 turns.\n\nActions at k=0 to 8, total 9 actions.\n\nBut at k=8, y_8=9, reached.\n\nIf we have y_4=5, then:\n\nFor example, to have y_4=5: from start, go up slower.\n\nThen at k=4, y=5, then at k=4 action U, y_5=6 (since must have y_5<=6, 6 is ok)\n\nThen at k=5, y=6, action U, y_6=7\n\nk=6, y=7, U, y_7=8\n\nk=7, y=8, U, y_8=9\n\nSame as before, k=8, y=9.\n\nBut with y_4=5, we have y_5=6, same as before.\n\nIn this case, at k=4 we did U to go from 5 to 6.\n\nBut in previous, with y_4=6, we did S to stay at 6.\n\nBut the path to y=9 is same length.\n\nBut we started with y_4=5 or 6.\n\nTo reach y_4=5, we can have, for example, two U, one S, one D or something, but might take same or more steps.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, from y_5=6, we need three ups, so up to k=8.\n\nIf we can have y_5 higher, but y_5<=6, so max y_5=6.\n\nThus, minimal M is 8, with y_8=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 by k=6, but to reach y=9 at k=6, we need y_6=9.\n\nFrom y=3, in 6 steps, min k=6 to reach y=9.\n\nBut at k=4 and k=5, we need to be <=6.\n\nIf we go up fast, at k=4, y=7>6, not allowed.\n\nIf we go slower, but to reach y=9 at k=6, we need to have net +6 in 6 steps, so all U except possibly some, but if we have a down or stay, we fall behind.\n\nFor example, to reach y_6=9, we need sum_{i=0}^5 Δy_i =6, since y_6 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^5 Δy_i =3 + sum_{i=0}^5 Δy_i\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum =6.\n\nIn 6 steps, with each Δy <=1, we need exactly six U actions, no S or D.\n\nThen y_1=4, y_2=5, y_3=6, y_4=7, y_5=8, y_6=9.\n\nBut at k=4, y=7, which is bad; k=5, y=8, bad.\n\nSo collision, not possible.\n\nIf we do five U and one S, then y_6=3+5=8<9, not reach.\n\nOr six U is only way to reach at k=6, but causes collision.\n\nThus, cannot reach by k=6.\n\nSimilarly, k=7: y_7=9.\n\nThen y_7 =3 + sum_{i=0}^6 Δy_i =9, so sum=6.\n\nIn 7 steps, we can have six U and one S, or five U and two S, etc., but need sum=6.\n\nNow, at k=4 and k=5, we need y_4<=6 and y_5<=6.\n\nWith seven actions to k=6, but y at k=4 and k=5.\n\nFor example, suppose we have some S or D early to keep y low at k=4.\n\nBut to reach y_7=9, with sum Δy=6 in 7 steps.\n\nFor instance, we can have six U and one S.\n\nNow, we need to place the S such that y_4<=6 and y_5<=6.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 =3 + sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i\n\nWe need this <=6.\n\nSimilarly, y_5 =3 + sum_{i=0}^4 Δy_i <=6\n\nIf we use S at some point.\n\nBut let's see if we can have y_7=9 with no collision.\n\nFor example, if we do S at k=3, then:\n\nk=0: y=3, U, y1=4\n\nk=1: y=4, U, y2=5\n\nk=2: y=5, U, y3=6\n\nk=3: y=6, S, y4=6  (since Δy=0)\n\nNow y_4=6 <=6, good.\n\nThen k=4: y=6, now we need y_5<=6, so we cannot go up, must S or D.\n\nSay S: y5=6\n\nBut y5=6<=6, good.\n\nThen k=5: y=6, action U, y6=7\n\nk=6: y=7, U, y7=8\n\nBut we need y_7=9, not 8.\n\ny_7=8, not 9.\n\nWe have only five U so far? Actions: k=0 U, k=1 U, k=2 U, k=3 S, k=4 S, k=5 U, k=6 U, then y7=8.\n\nWe need y_7=9, so we need another U, but at k=6 we did U to y7=8, then at k=7 we can U to y8=9.\n\nBut we are considering M=7 for y_7=9, but here y_7=8.\n\nTo have y_7=9, we need six U in first 7 actions.\n\nIn above, we used only four U by k=6? Let's list:\n\nAfter actions:\n\nStart k=0, y=3\n\na0=U, y1=4\n\na1=U, y2=5\n\na2=U, y3=6\n\na3=S, y4=6  (position at turn k=4 is y4=6)\n\na4=S, y5=6  (at turn k=5, y5=6)\n\na5=U, y6=7\n\na6=U, y7=8\n\nSo at k=7, y7=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y7=9, we need a6=U to y7=8? y7 is position at turn 7.\n\nAfter a6, y7.\n\nIn sequence: after a_k, we have y_{k+1}, but y_k is before action.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k, action a_k, then y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nThen at turn k+1, position y_{k+1}, etc.\n\nFor y_7 to be 9, it means at turn 7, position is 9.\n\ny_7 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^6 Δy_i ? y_7 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^6 Δy_i only if we think of the sum from action effects.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\ny_k = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\nFor example, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1 = (y_0 + Δy_0) + Δy_1 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^1 Δy_i\n\nSimilarly, y_k = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\nTherefore, to have y_k = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M.\n\ny_M = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{M-1} Δy_i =9, so sum_{i=0}^{M-1} Δy_i =6\n\nNow, for M=7, y_7=9, so sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i =6\n\nThat is, in the first 7 actions (from k=0 to k=6), the sum of Δy must be 6.\n\nEach Δy is +1 for U, 0 for S, -1 for D.\n\nTo have sum=6 with 7 actions, we need exactly six U and one S, or five U and two S and one D but D would decrease, so to have sum=6, best is six U and one S.\n\nNow, the position at intermediate turns.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i\n\nWe need y_4 <=6\n\nSimilarly, y_5 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=6\n\nNow, y_0=3.\n\nsum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i <=3\n\nSince we need total sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i=6 for M=7.\n\nBut we also need to satisfy y_4 <=6 and y_5<=6.\n\ny_4 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i <=6, so sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i <=3\n\ny_5 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=6, so sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=3\n\nNow, since sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i=6, and there are 7 actions.\n\nIf we place the S early, we can keep the sum low.\n\nFor example, suppose we do S at k=0.\n\nThen a0=S, Δy0=0, y1=3 +0=3\n\nThen at k=1, y=3\n\nBut y_4 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i\n\nIf a0=S, sum_{i=0}^{3} includes Δy0 to Δy3.\n\nSet actions:\n\nSuppose we want y_4 <=6 and y_5<=6 with sum up to k=4 small.\n\nBut we need to reach sum=6 by k=6 actions? Actions from k=0 to k=6, 7 actions.\n\ny_5 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i\n\nWe need this <=3? <=6, but to have room, but y_5 <=6.\n\nSince we need sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=3 for y_5<=6.\n\nSimilarly, sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i <=3 for y_4<=6.\n\nBut total sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i=6.\n\nSo the last two actions must compensate.\n\nFor example, suppose in first 5 actions, we have sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=3, so that y_5 <=6.\n\nThen for actions k=5 and k=6, we can do U and U, so Δy5=1, Δy6=1, then sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i = sum_{0-4} +1 +1 <=3 +2=5 <6, not enough for y_7=9.\n\ny_7 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i, set to 9, so sum=6.\n\nIf sum_{0-4} <=3, then even with two U at k=5 and k=6, sum <= 3+1+1=5<6, so y_7 <= 3+5=8<9.\n\nNot reach.\n\nIf sum_{0-4} =3, then y_5=6, then with two U, y_7=8<9.\n\nIf we have only five U and one S, one something, but to have sum=6, need six U and one S.\n\nBut if we place S late, then early sum is high.\n\nFor example, suppose we do all U except S at k=6.\n\nBut k=6 action affects y7, but y_7 is the position.\n\ny_k for k=4 and k=5.\n\nIf we do U from k=0 to k=5, except one S somewhere.\n\nBut if we do U at k=0,1,2,3, then y_4 =3 + Δy0+Δy1+Δy2+Δy3, if all U, y4=7>6, not allowed.\n\nIf we do S at k=3, then y4=6 as before.\n\nThen y5: if a4, if we do U at k=4, y5=7>6 not allowed; if S, y5=6.\n\nThen a5, if U, y6=7; a6, if U, y7=8<9.\n\nTo have y7=9, we need a6=U but that makes y7=8 if y6=7.\n\nWith y6=7, a6=U, y7=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf we do U at k=5 and k=6, but y6= y5 + Δy5.\n\nIf y5=6, a5=U, y6=7; a6=U, y7=8.\n\nStill 8.\n\nUnless we have an extra U.\n\nBut we have only seven actions, six U and one S.\n\nIf we place S at k=0, then:\n\na0=S, Δy0=0, y1=3\n\na1=U, y2=4\n\na2=U, y3=5\n\na3=U, y4=6\n\ny4=6<=6 good.\n\na4=U, but then y5= y4 + Δy4, y4=6, a4=U, y5=7>6 not allowed for y5.\n\nBut we need y5<=6.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=6\n\nThen a5=U, y6=7\n\na6=U, y7=8<9\n\nSame.\n\nIf we do the S later, but then y4 or y5 high.\n\nFor example, a0=U, y1=4\n\na1=U, y2=5\n\na2=U, y3=6\n\na3=S, y4=6  (good)\n\na4= must not U, so S or D, say S, y5=6\n\na5=U, y6=7\n\na6=U, y7=8<9\n\nStill not 9.\n\nTo have y7=9, we need seven U, but we have only six U and one S, so y7=3+6=9 only if no down, but with S, y7=8 or less.\n\ny7 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i\n\nWith six U and one S, sum =6*1 + 0 =6, so y7=3+6=9.\n\nBut in the position, y7=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, when does it reach y7=9?\n\nFor example: suppose actions:\n\nk=0: U, y1=4\n\nk=1: U, y2=5\n\nk=2: U, y3=6\n\nk=3: S, y4=6  (at turn k=4, y4=6)\n\nk=4: S, y5=6  (turn k=5, y5=6)\n\nk=5: U, y6=7  (turn k=6, y6=7)\n\nk=6: U, y7=8  (turn k=7, y7=8)\n\ny7=8, not 9.\n\ny7 is position at turn 7.\n\nAfter a6, we have y7.\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny1 = y0 + Δy0\n\ny0=3\n\nSo y7 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + ... + Δy6\n\n= 3 + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i\n\nIf we have six U and one S, sum Δy_i = 6, so y7=9.\n\nIn the above, at k=6, we perform a6, which affects y7.\n\nIn the list, for turn k=6, position y6, we do a6, then y7 = y6 + Δy6.\n\nThen at turn k=7, position y7.\n\nFor y7 to be 9, we need y7=9 at turn 7.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions including one S, y7=9.\n\nBut in the example above, I have y7=8 because I did only five U? Let's count the U.\n\nIn the actions: k=0: U, so Δy0=1\n\nk=1: U, Δy1=1\n\nk=2: U, Δy2=1\n\nk=3: S, Δy3=0\n\nk=4: S, Δy4=0\n\nk=5: U, Δy5=1\n\nk=6: U, Δy6=1\n\nSum Δy_i =1+1+1+0+0+1+1=5, so y7=3+5=8, not 9.\n\nI have only five U: k=0,1,2,5,6, and two S at k=3,4.\n\nTo have six U, I need to replace one S with U.\n\nBut if I do U at k=4, for example:\n\nk=0: U, y1=4\n\nk=1: U, y2=5\n\nk=2: U, y3=6\n\nk=3: S, y4=6  (position at k=4)\n\nNow at k=4, y4=6, if I do a4=U, then y5=7\n\nBut at k=5, position y5=7, which must be <=6, but 7>6, not allowed, collision if on freeway, but at k=5, T=16, y=7, freeway 7, and at T=16, there is car, so collision.\n\nBut even if no collision, we require y_5<=6 to avoid.\n\nSo cannot do U at k=4.\n\nIf I do U at k=3 instead of S:\n\nk=0: U, y1=4\n\nk=1: U, y2=5\n\nk=2: U, y3=6\n\nk=3: U, y4=7  (at k=4, y4=7>6, not allowed)\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I do S earlier, but then I might not reach.\n\nSuppose I do the S at k=6.\n\nBut y_4 and y_5 need to be <=6.\n\nIf I do U all from k=0 to k=3, y4=7>6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nThus, it is impossible to reach y=9 by k=7 with no collision, because to have y_7=9, we need sum Δy=6 in first 7 actions, but to have y_4<=6 and y_5<=6, we need low sum early, but then the late actions cannot compensate to reach sum=6 without violating y_5<=6 or causing high y early.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_5<=6, y_5 =3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=6, so sum_{0-4} <=3\n\nThen for actions k=5 and k=6, Δy5 and Δy6 <=1 each, so sum_{0-6} <= 3 +1 +1 =5 <6, so y_7 <=8<9.\n\nThus, cannot have y_7=9.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier M.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible to reach y=9 is at k=8, with y_8=9.\n\nAs in the first plan.\n\nWith H-1=8, so H=9 actions from k=0 to k=8.\n\nNow, back to the plan: we need y_4=6 and y_5=6.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 in three steps.\n\nTo have y_4=6: from y0=3, in four actions, we need sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i =3, so three U and one S in the first four actions (k=0 to k=3).\n\nThe S can be at any of k=0,1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly, at k=4, since y4=6, we do S to keep y5=6.\n\nThen at k=5, y5=6, we do U to y6=7\n\nk=6, y6=7, U to y7=8\n\nk=7, y7=8, U to y8=9\n\nAt k=8, y8=9.\n\nNow, we need to choose where to put the S in the first four actions.\n\nAlso, check if any collision during the path.\n\nIn this sequence, positions:\n\nk=0: y=3, action? Suppose we do S at k=0 or later.\n\nFor example, if we do S at k=3:\n\n- Turn k=0 (abs T=11): y=3, action U (say), then y1=4\n\nBut at k=0, we are on y=3, freeway 3, but at T=11, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAction a0: we can choose.\n\nTo have flexibility, let's put S not at the beginning.\n\nSince we need one S in k=0-3, we can do it at k=3 to go up first.\n\nBut let's list the sequence with actions.\n\nAlso, at k=4, we do S, so position at k=4 and k=5 are both 6.\n\nFreeway 6, always safe.\n\nk=6, y=7, T=17, no issue.\n\nk=7, y=8, T=18, no issue.\n\nk=8, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for the S in first four, let's choose to do it at k=2, for example.\n\nSo:\n\nAt relative turn k=0 (T=11): position y=3, action a0: U → y1=4\n\nk=1 (T=12): y=4, action a1: U → y2=5\n\nk=2 (T=13): y=5, action a2: S → y3=5? Action at k=2, to set for y3.\n\ny_k position at turn k.\n\nAfter a_k, y_{k+1}.\n\nAt k=2, y=5, if a2=S, then y3=5\n\nThen at k=3, y=5, action a3: U → y4=6\n\nNow y4=6 at k=4.\n\nThen at k=4 (T=15): y=6, action a4: S → y5=6\n\nk=5 (T=16): y=6, action a5: U → y6=7\n\nk=6 (T=17): y=7, action a6: U → y7=8\n\nk=7 (T=18): y=8, action a7: U → y8=9\n\nk=8 (T=19): y=9, we are at y=9 at turn k=8, which is T=19.\n\nBut we need to stop when y=9, so at k=8, y=9, and we don't need to act further, but the action sequence includes up to a_{H-1} with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nHere H-1=8, so actions from k=0 to k=7? k from 0 to H-1.\n\ny_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at k=8, y=9, so H-1=8, so actions a_0 to a_7.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt k=0 to k=7 actions: a0 to a7.\n\nAfter a7, y8=9.\n\nAnd at turn k=8, position y8=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for k=8, we are at y8=9, but we don't perform action after that for this turn? The action is performed at the turn.\n\nThe sequence has actions for each turn from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then perform a_T.\n\nThen for the last turn, when y_T=9, we perform a_T, but it doesn't matter as long as we are at 9.\n\nIn this case, for k=8, y=9, we can do S or whatever.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with 8 actions? k from 0 to 7 for actions? Let's list turns.\n\nAbsolute turns:\n\nTurn t_1=11: position y=3, action a_{11} = U (in this example)\n\nThen at turn 12: position y=4 (since after a11, y12=4)\n\nTurn 12: position y=4, action a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: position y=5, action a_{13} = S (in my choice)\n\nThen after a13=S, y14=5\n\nTurn 14: position y=5, action a_{14} = U\n\nAfter a14=U, y15=6\n\nTurn 15: position y=6, action a_{15} = S\n\nAfter a15=S, y16=6\n\nTurn 16: position y=6, action a_{16} = U\n\nAfter a16=U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17: position y=7, action a_{17} = U\n\nAfter a17=U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18: position y=8, action a_{18} = U\n\nAfter a18=U, y19=9\n\nTurn 19: position y=9, which is where we want to be at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=11, turn 19 = 11 + 8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nAt turn 19, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 11 to turn 18, that's 8 actions? Turns: 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 → 8 actions.\n\nThen at turn 19, position is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a_{11} to a_{11+8}? t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=9, t_1 + H -1 =11+9-1=19.\n\nAction at turn 19? But at turn 19, we are at y=9, and we perform an action, but it might change y, but since we are already at 9, and we need to be at 9 at that turn, we can do S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence above, after action at turn 18, we reach y=19 at turn 19? Position at turn 19 is after action of turn 18.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, we do a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=9.\n\nThen at turn 19, position y_{19}=9, and we need to include action for turn 19? But in the sequence, actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a_{19} for H=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11+9-1=19.\n\nSo we need action at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, position y=9, we can do a_{19}=S to stay at y=9, or U but y=10 not allowed, so must S or D, but S is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in general, we need to specify action at that turn.\n\nBut since we are at y=9, S is safe.\n\nNow, in the above sequence, we have 9 actions: from turn 11 to 19.\n\nActions: turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: S, turn 14: U, turn 15: S, turn 16: U, turn 17: U, turn 18: U, turn 19: S\n\nBut at turn 19, we do S, but we are already at 9, fine.\n\nNow, check the critical points:\n\nAt turn 15 (k=4), position y=6, not 7 or 8, and freeway 6 safe.\n\nAt turn 16 (k=5), position y=6, same.\n\nNo collision.\n\nWe could put the first S at different place.\n\nBut this works.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence? H=9, with 9 turns.\n\nEarlier we thought min is 8, but we saw cannot reach by k=7.\n\nk=7 is turn 18, y=8 or something.\n\nBut not 9.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 18 with y=9.\n\ny_18=9? Turn 18 is t_1 +7, since t_1=11, 18=11+7, so k=7.\n\ny_7=9.\n\nThen need to reach from y=3 to y=9 in 7 steps.\n\ny_7 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{6} Δy_i =9, so sum=6.\n\nWith 7 actions, need six U and one S.\n\nNow, y_4 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δy_i\n\nNeed y_4 <=6\n\ny_5 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{4} Δy_i <=6\n\nSuppose we place the S at k=0.\n\na0=S, Δy0=0, y1=3\n\na1=U, y2=4\n\na2=U, y3=5\n\na3=U, y4=6\n\ny4=6<=6 good.\n\na4= ? Now y4=6, at turn k=4, y=6, action a4.\n\nIf a4=U, then y5=7, but y5 must <=6, 7>6 not allowed.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=6\n\nThen a5=U, y6=7\n\na6=U, y7=8<9, not 9.\n\ny7=8.\n\nIf we do a4=U, y5=7, but collision at T=16 if y=7.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPlace S at k=6.\n\nBut y_4: if a0=U, y1=4\n\na1=U, y2=5\n\na2=U, y3=6\n\na3=U, y4=7>6 not allowed.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOther placements similar.\n\nThus, impossible to reach by turn 18.\n\nHence minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nIn my example, I have S at k=2 (turn 13) and S at k=4 (turn 15).\n\nBut we can have the first S at different turn.\n\nTo make it simple, we can have the S at the beginning or end, but let's write the sequence.\n\nSince freeways 1-6 are safe, we can be on them anytime except the constraint for y=7,8 at t=15,16.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11: start y=3, we can do U or S.\n\nIf we do S at turn 11: then y12=3, then we need to go up later, but might take more turns.\n\nTo save time, better to go up when possible.\n\nSo, for example, one possible sequence:\n\nTurn 11: action U, to y12=4\n\nTurn 12: action U, to y13=5\n\nTurn 13: action U, to y14=6\n\nBut at turn 14, y=6, then if we do U, y15=7, but at turn 15, y=7, T=15, collision.\n\nSo we need to stay or down at some point.\n\nIn my earlier, at turn 13, I did S, so y14=5, then turn 14: U, y15=6.\n\nThen safe.\n\nWe can do:\n\nTurn 11: U → y12=4\n\nTurn 12: U → y13=5\n\nTurn 13: U → y14=6  (at turn 14, y=6)\n\nNow, to have y15<=6, at turn 14, action cannot U, so do S: a14=S, then y15=6\n\nThen turn 15: y=6, action U? But y15=6, if a15=U, y16=7, but at turn 16, y=7? Position at turn 16 is y16.\n\nAfter a15, y16.\n\nAt turn 15: position y15=6, action a15.\n\nIf a15=U, then y16=7\n\nThen at turn 16, position y16=7, which is T=16, y=7, freeway 7, collision.\n\nBut we need y16 <=6? At k=5, turn 16, y must <=6 to avoid collision.\n\ny16 must <=6.\n\nBut if y15=6, and a15=U, y16=7>6.\n\nSo we must not go up at turn 15 if y15=6.\n\nThus, at turn 15, we need to do S or D to keep y16<=6.\n\nBut y16 is position at turn 16.\n\nTo have y16<=6, and since we need to go up later.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 14: y14=6, a14=S, y15=6\n\nTurn 15: y15=6, now action a15: must not U, so S or D.\n\nIf S, y16=6\n\nIf D, y16=5\n\nThen at turn 16, position y16=6 or 5, <=6, safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y16=6, need three ups, to turn 19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at turn 15 we do D, y16=5, then need more steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to do S at turn 15, y16=6.\n\nThen turn 16: U, y17=7\n\nTurn 17: U, y18=8\n\nTurn 18: U, y19=9\n\nTurn 19: S, to stay.\n\nNow, the S in the first part: we can have it at turn 11,12,13, or 14, but in this, at turn 14 we did S to keep y15=6.\n\nBut turn 14 is not critical.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U → to y12=4\n\nTurn 12: U → to y13=5\n\nTurn 13: U → to y14=6\n\nTurn 14: S → to y15=6 (position at turn 15)\n\nTurn 15: S → to y16=6\n\nTurn 16: U → to y17=7\n\nTurn 17: U → to y18=8\n\nTurn 18: U → to y19=9\n\nTurn 19: S → to y20=9, but we are at turn 19, y=9.\n\nAt turn 19, after action, y20=9, but position at turn 19 is y19=9 before action? At turn 19, position y19=9, we do a19=S, then y20=9.\n\nBut for turn 19, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 11 to 19.\n\nNow, at turn 14: we did S, but we could have done U at turn 13 to y14=6, then S at turn 14 to y15=6.\n\nBut if we did U at turn 13, y14=6.\n\nSame as above.\n\nTo avoid S at turn 14, we can have S earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 11: S → y12=3\n\nBut then we start lower.\n\nTurn 11: S, to y12=3\n\nTurn 12: U, to y13=4\n\nTurn 13: U, to y14=5\n\nTurn 14: U, to y15=6\n\nThen same as before, turn 15: S, to y16=6, etc.\n\nBut we wasted a turn at beginning, same H.\n\nTurn 11: U, to y12=4\n\nTurn 12: S, to y13=4? If a12=S, y13=4\n\nTurn 13: U, to y14=5\n\nTurn 14: U, to y15=6\n\nThen turn 15: S, to y16=6\n\nThen turn 16: U, to y17=7\n\nTurn 17: U, to y18=8\n\nTurn 18: U, to y19=9\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nSame.\n\nIn all cases, 9 turns.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to write the action sequence.\n\nAlso, in freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we only care when 0 in span, which we handled.\n\nNow, the car on freeway 7 and 8 at T=15 and 16 with the car (-24,-35,right,6), which we avoided.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nI think any sequence that satisfies is fine.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at turn 11, position y=3.\n\nAction for turn 11: U\n\nThen turn 12: position y=4, action U\n\nTurn 13: position y=5, action U\n\nTurn 14: position y=6, action S\n\nTurn 15: position y=6, action S\n\nTurn 16: position y=6, action U\n\nTurn 17: position y=7, action U\n\nTurn 18: position y=8, action U\n\nTurn 19: position y=9, action S\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 19, we do S to stay.\n\nBut we could do other actions, but S is fine.\n\nNow, H=9.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 19, we have action.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=11, H=9, so up to turn 11+9-1=19.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut at turn 14, we did S, which is fine.\n\nTo make it cleaner, we can have the first S at turn 11.\n\nBut same.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 7 and 8, but we didn't go there at bad times.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 11, y=3, freeway 3, no issue.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nAbsolute:\n\nt=11: y=3, a=U → y12=4\n\nt=12: y=4, a=U → y13=5\n\nt=13: y=5, a=U → y14=6\n\nt=14: y=6, a=S → y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, a=S → y16=6\n\nt=16: y=6, a=U → y17=7\n\nt=17: y=7, a=U → y18=8\n\nt=18: y=8, a=U → y19=9\n\nt=19: y=9, a=S → y20=9, but position at t=19 is y=9.\n\nAnd no collision at any point.\n\nAt t=15 and t=16, y=6, freeway 6, no cars at x=0.\n\nFreeway 6 has a car (18,7,right,6), but at t>=11, span [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT] >= [7,18] >0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer, we need to box it.\n\nSo for t_1=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 14,15 we have S, which are waiting, necessary to avoid moving up.\n\nWe could have different, but this is fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on freeway 7 or 8 at turns 15 or 16 (relative to \\(t_1\\), as these are the only turns and positions where collisions occur due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- Collision occurs on freeway 7 or 8 at turn 15 (absolute turn 26) or turn 16 (absolute turn 27) if the player is on that freeway, based on the car states.\n- At all other times and positions, the freeways are safe, including \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 9, with the position reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 9 - 1 = 19\\). The sequence is designed to:\n- Move up as quickly as possible initially to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 14.\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 14 and 15 to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(8\\) at turns 15 and 16.\n- Move up from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in the remaining turns.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 11 (\\(t_1\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 12, position \\(y = 4\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 13, position \\(y = 5\\).

Action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, position \\(y = 6\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 17, position \\(y = 7\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=12, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a constant speed, and their positions change linearly over time. Collision happens only if at the turn T when I'm on a freeway, the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on the new row at the current turn.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8. Let me list them clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12) — head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 12. Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)] with t₁=12.\n\nDirection right means the car is moving to the right, so as time increases, the span shifts to higher x values.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would shift to lower x values.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right\n\nFreeway 2: (24,13,right,6) — head 24, tail 13? That doesn't make sense because if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? I think I have a confusion here.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the car update, it says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t₁, the span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I think. τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn freeway 2, it says (24,13,right,6). But 24 and 13, if τ=13, h=24, then [τ,h] = [13,24] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving, so that simplifies things.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nThe span for a car at time T (relative to t₁) is for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSince t₁=12, let's define τ = T - t₁, so time offset.\n\nSet δt = T - t₁, so at time T = t₁ + δt, for a car with parameters (h, τ, d, s) at t₁, the span is:\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k for some freeway k, and 0 ∈ [τ + s δt, h + s δt] for some car on k.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at t₁=12.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is the top, no cars, I assume, since cars are on freeways 1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars there.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nI start at (0,4), which is on freeway 4? No, y=4 is a freeway, but at turn t₁, I'm at y=4, so I need to check if at t₁, I collide with any car on y=4.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y_T, I collide if 0 in span of car on y_T at T.\n\nAt t₁, I am on y=4, so I need to check freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: (24,13,right,6)\n\nAt t₁, δt=0, span: for each car, [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [τ, h]\n\nFor (24,13,right,6), τ=13, h=24? Notation is (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, span is [tail, head] I think.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h], so τ should be less than h.\n\nIn freeway 4, (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13? But 13<24, so [13,24] at t₁.\n\n0 is not in [13,24], so no collision at t₁ on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have cars, but since I'm only on y=4 at t₁, I only care about y=4 at that time.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\ny increases by 1 with U, decreases by 1 with D, or stay with S.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t depending on action.\n\nTo minimize turns, I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I need to avoid the cars when I'm on the freeway rows.\n\nSince I start at y=4 and need to go to y=9, I need to increase y by 5, so minimum H would be 5 if I can go up each turn without colliding.\n\nBut I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway and each possible time, when there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each δt ≥ 0, when 0 is in the span of some car on k at time t₁ + δt.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only check at integer turns.\n\nδt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt increases by 1 per turn.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find for which δt, at time t₁ + δt, 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nThen, when I am on that row at that time, I would collide.\n\nBut I am on a row at time T if I arrive there at turn T, meaning that at turn T, after action, I am on y_T.\n\nLet me define the turn when I am on each y.\n\nI start at t₁=12, y=4.\n\nAt turn T, I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position is given at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at position y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T when I am on y_T, meaning at the start of turn T, I am on y_T, and if 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is only based on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you stay, S, then y_{T+1} = y_T, so at turn T+1, you are on same row.\n\nIf you move up or down, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1} = y_T ±1, and at that turn, you check cars on that row at time T+1.\n\nThe key point is that when you change rows, you are not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nBack to the cars.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need to find the set of times t where at time t, there is a car on k such that 0 is in its span.\n\nSince t = t₁ + δt, and t₁=12, let's use δt for simplicity, δt ≥ 0.\n\nSo for each k, find for which δt, collision occurs on k at t₁ + δt.\n\nThen, for my path, I need that for each turn T when I am on y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, then T should not be in the collision set for that y_T.\n\nSince y=0 and 9 have no cars, no collision there.\n\nI start at t₁=12, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, once I'm there, I'm done.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start to when I first reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think, from t= t₁ to t= t₁ + H -1, so after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t₁ + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, I am at y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}\n\nAfter all actions, at turn t₁ + H, I am at some position, but we want to reach (0,9) at turn t= t₁ + H -1? I need to clarify the indexing.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t₁, before any action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nThen I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after taking action a_t, I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t₁ + H.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} = 9? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\".\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nAt turn t₁, I am at y_{t₁} =4.\n\nI take action a_{t₁}, which determines y_{t₁ +1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}\n\nThen at turn t₁ +1, I am at y_{t₁ +1}, take action a_{t₁ +1}, and so on, up to action a_{t₁ + H -1}, which determines y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} is the position at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t₁ + H -2}, I am at y_{t₁ + H -1} at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t₁ + H -1, I take action a_{t₁ + H -1}, which determines y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we don't care about y_{t₁ + H}, as long as at turn t₁ + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nSo when I am at y=9 at turn t₁ + H -1, I am done, and I take no further actions, or the action for that turn might be S or whatever, but since I'm at 9, I can just stay or do nothing, but the sequence includes actions up to a_{t₁ + H -1}, which is the action I take at turn t₁ + H -1 when I am at y=9.\n\nBut since I'm already at 9, I can take S, and y stays 9.\n\nI could take U or D, but y would go to 10 or 8, which are invalid, since y in [0,9], so probably I should take S when at 9.\n\nThe position is clamped, y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t +1) =9, similarly for D at 0.\n\nBut in this case, since we want to be at 9, once there, S is fine.\n\nFor the path, from y=4 to y=9, I need to increase y by 5, so minimum 5 actions if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway to see when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, list the cars and their span as a function of δt.\n\nδt = T - t₁, T is turn number.\n\nt₁=12.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h, tail τ, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so span at time T: [τ + s (T - t₁), h + s (T - t₁)] = [-59 + 12 δt, -48 + 12 δt]\n\nWhere δt = T - 12.\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [-59 + 12 δt, -48 + 12 δt]\n\nSo -59 + 12 δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12 δt\n\nLet's solve:\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 12 δt ≤ 0 => 12 δt ≤ 59 => δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so δt ≤ 4 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 12 δt => 48 ≤ 12 δt => δt ≥ 48/12 = 4\n\nSo δt ≥ 4 and δt ≤ 4.916, so for δt=4, 0 is in the span? Let's check:\n\nAt δt=4: lower bound -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nUpper bound -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], and 0 is included, since it's a closed interval? The span is inclusive, I assume, as per notation.\n\nIn the collision definition, \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and span is [low, high], so inclusive.\n\nSo at δt=4, span [-11, 0], 0 is included, so collision.\n\nAt δt=3: lower -59 + 36 = -23, upper -48 + 36 = -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nδt=5: lower -59 + 60 =1, upper -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at δt=4, i.e., turn T=12+4=16.\n\nδt=4, T=16.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: (24,13,right,6)\n\nAssuming head=24, tail=13, so at t₁, span [13,24]\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [13 + 6 δt, 24 + 6 δt]\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [13 + 6 δt, 24 + 6 δt]\n\n13 + 6 δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 6 δt\n\nFirst: 13 + 6 δt ≤ 0 => 6 δt ≤ -13 => δt ≤ -13/6 ≈ -2.166, but δt ≥0, impossible.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 24 + 6 δt always true since δt≥0.\n\nBut first inequality never true, so no solution. 0 is not in the interval because 13 + 6δt ≥13 >0 for all δt≥0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since both positive.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound larger, but lower bound min at δt=0 is 13>0, so for all δt, span [13+6δt, 24+6δt] all values ≥13>0, so 0 never in. No collision on freeway 2 at any time.\n\nBut freeway 2 has the same car as 3,4,5,6? No, freeway 2 has one car (24,13,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (24,13,right,6) same as above, so no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24,13,right,6), no collision.\n\nFreeway 5: same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 6: same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as before, [13+6δt, 24+6δt], all >0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6), head=60, tail=49, so span [49 +6δt, 60+6δt], all ≥49>0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6), head=-18, tail=-29, so span [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [-29 + 6 δt, -18 + 6 δt]\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [-29 + 6 δt, -18 + 6 δt]\n\nSo -29 + 6 δt ≤ 0 ≤ -18 + 6 δt\n\nFirst: -29 + 6 δt ≤ 0 => 6 δt ≤ 29 => δt ≤ 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so δt ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18 + 6 δt => 18 ≤ 6 δt => δt ≥ 3\n\nSo δt ≥ 3 and δt ≤ 4.833, so δt=3 or 4.\n\nAt δt=3: lower -29 + 18 = -11, upper -18 + 18 =0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt δt=4: lower -29 + 24 = -5, upper -18 + 24 =6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt δt=2: lower -29+12=-17, upper -18+12=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nδt=5: lower -29+30=1, upper -18+30=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car on freeway 7, collision at δt=3 and 4, i.e., T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 7 don't cover 0, so overall for freeway 7, collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nFreeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, first two cars never cover 0, third car covers at δt=3 and 4, T=15 and 16.\n\nSo freeway 8 collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow freeway 1 we had collision only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 2 to 6 no collision.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\ny starts at 4 at t=12.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and minimize the number of turns from start.\n\nSince I need to increase by 5, min H=5 if possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nList the collision times for each row:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): collision at T=16 only\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): no collision\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): no collision\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): no collision, as we saw at t=12\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): no collision\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): no collision\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): collision at T=15 and 16\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): collision at T=15 and 16\n\nNow, I start at t=12, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe critical times are T=15 and 16, where y=7 and y=8 have collision.\n\nAlso, y=1 has collision at T=16.\n\nBut since I'm going up, I might not be on y=1.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=15 or T=16.\n\nSimilarly, if I go through y=1 at T=16, but I'm going up, so probably not.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn t₁ + H -1 = 12 + H -1.\n\nSet T_final = t₁ + H -1, so y_{T_final} =9.\n\nT_final = 12 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from t=12 to t=12 + H -1, H actions.\n\nAt turn 12, I start at y=4.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nI need to plan the sequence so that for each turn T from 12 to T_final, when I am on y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it should not be a collision time for that row.\n\nSince T_final is when I reach 9, and 9 is safe.\n\nNow, min H=5, so T_final = 12 + 5 -1 =16.\n\nSo if I can reach y=9 at T=16.\n\ny_16 =9.\n\nNow, at T=16, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, I need to get from y_12=4 to y_16=9 in 4 steps? From turn 12 to turn 16, that's 4 turns later? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 12, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_12, y_13 = y_12 + Δy_12\n\nAt turn 13, y_13\n\nAfter a_13, y_14\n\nAt turn 14, y_14\n\nAfter a_14, y_15\n\nAt turn 15, y_15\n\nAfter a_15, y_16\n\nAt turn 16, y_16\n\nWe want y_16=9.\n\nSo from y_12=4 to y_16=9, I need to increase by 5 in 4 steps? y_16 = y_12 + sum_{t=12 to 15} Δy_t\n\nSince Δy_t in {-1,0,1}, to increase by 5 in 4 steps, I need to go up every time, no down or stay.\n\nSo if I go U every turn from t=12 to t=15, then:\n\na_12=U, y_13=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7\n\na_15=U, y_16=8? y_16= y_15 +1 =7+1=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_12=4\n\nAfter a_12=U, y_13=5\n\nAt turn 13, y=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\nTurn 14, y=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7\n\nTurn 15, y=7\n\na_15=U, y_16=8\n\nTurn 16, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 16, I need y_16=9.\n\nBut from y_12=4, to y_16=9, that's 4 actions: a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so after 4 actions, y_16 <= y_12 +4 =8, so y_16 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny_16 = y_12 + Δy_12 + Δy_13 + Δy_14 + Δy_15\n\nSince y_12=4, to have y_16=9, need sum of four Δy = +5, but each <=1, impossible.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9: starting from y=4, need to increase by 5, each U gives +1, so at least 5 U actions.\n\nEach action increases the turn.\n\nAt turn t, after k actions, I am at turn t+k.\n\nAt turn t₁=12, before any action.\n\nAfter first action a_t1, at turn t₁+1, y_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t₁ + k, y_{t₁ + k}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9 for some H.\n\nSet T = t₁ + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nThe number of actions from t₁ to T-1? Actions from t₁ to T-1 determine y_T.\n\ny_T is reached after (T - t₁) actions? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t₁, y_t1 given.\n\nAfter action a_t1, y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{T-1}, y_T\n\nSo to have y_T=9, I need actions from t₁ to T-1, that is, T - t₁ actions.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so the last action is a_{t₁ + H -1}, which determines y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} is determined by actions up to a_{t₁ + H -2}, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn τ, y_τ\n\nThen action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, ..., a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t₁ + H -2}, y_{t₁ + H -1}  (since a_{t₁ + H -2} determines y_{t₁ + H -1})\n\nThen at turn t₁ + H -1, I am at y_{t₁ + H -1}, and I take action a_{t₁ + H -1}, which determines y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, so when I am at turn t₁ + H -1, I am at position 9.\n\nSo the actions that affect the position up to turn t₁ + H -1 are a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -2}, and a_{t₁ + H -1} is taken when I am at 9, but it doesn't change the position since I'm at 9.\n\nFor reaching y=9 at turn T, where T = t₁ + H -1, I need to go from y_{t₁} to y_T in (T - t₁) steps? From turn t₁ to turn T, there are (T - t₁) actions: a_{t₁} to a_{T-1}, determining y_{t₁+1} to y_T.\n\nBut y_{t₁} is given, so to reach y_T, I need actions from t₁ to T-1.\n\nThe number of actions to reach y_T is (T - t₁).\n\nThen, since T = t₁ + H -1, so T - t₁ = H -1.\n\nNumber of actions to reach y_T is H-1.\n\nBut H is the number of turns or actions in the sequence.\n\nTo have y_T =9, with T = t₁ + H -1, it takes (T - t₁) actions to go from y_{t₁} to y_T.\n\nSince y_{t₁} to y_T, difference in turns is D = T - t₁, so it takes D actions: a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + D -1} = a_{T-1}, and y_T is determined.\n\nThen T = t₁ + H -1, so D = T - t₁ = (t₁ + H -1) - t₁ = H -1.\n\nSo it takes H-1 actions to reach y_T from y_{t₁}, and then at turn T, we have the action a_T, but since we are at 9, it can be S.\n\nIn terms of reaching the position, the critical part is the actions before.\n\nFor collision, we care about the position at each turn from t₁ to T.\n\nFor each turn τ from t₁ to T, y_τ must be safe, i.e., if y_τ between 1 and 8, not collision time for that row.\n\nSince y_T=9 is safe.\n\nNow, from y_12=4 to y_T=9, I need to increase y by 5.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, S or D don't increase.\n\nTo increase by 5, I need at least 5 U actions.\n\nThe number of turns from start to T is D = T - t₁.\n\nDuring these D turns, I take actions that change y from 4 to 9, so net +5.\n\nLet U be number of U actions, D be number of D actions, S be number of S actions, from time t₁ to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions from t₁ to T-1 is D = T - t₁.\n\nThen y_T = y_{t₁} + U - D, since each U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\ny_T = y_{t₁} + (number of U) - (number of D)\n\nAnd number of U + number of D + number of S = D = T - t₁\n\ny_T =9, y_{t₁}=4, so 9 = 4 + U - D, so U - D =5\n\nAlso, U + D + S = D_turns, where D_turns = T - t₁\n\nThen from U - D =5, and U + D + S = D_turns, so adding: 2U + S = 5 + D_turns\n\nSince U, D, S >=0, D_turns >= U >=5.\n\nMin D_turns when S=0 and D=0, so U=5, D_turns=5.\n\nThen T - t₁ =5, so T = t₁ +5 =17.\n\nThen y_T = y_17 =9.\n\nH is such that T = t₁ + H -1 =17, so 12 + H -1 =17, thus H=6.\n\nT = t₁ + H -1 =17, so 12 + H -1 =17, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nWith H=6 actions, from a_12 to a_17, but a_17 is at turn 17, but we reach at turn 17? Let's see.\n\nT_final = t₁ + H -1 =17.\n\ny_17=9.\n\nActions: a_12 to a_16 determine y_13 to y_17.\n\ny_12=4 given.\n\na_12 determines y_13\n\na_13 determines y_14\n\n...\n\na_16 determines y_17\n\nSo to have y_17=9, we need actions from t=12 to t=16, that's 5 actions: a_12 to a_16.\n\nThen at turn 17, y_17=9, and we take action a_17, but since we are at 9, a_17 can be S, and it doesn't change.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a_17 as well, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nFor H=6, actions a_12 to a_17.\n\na_12 to a_16: 5 actions to go from y_12 to y_17\n\na_17: action at turn 17 when at y_17=9.\n\nWith min actions, if I go up every step.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, with H=6, T_final=17.\n\nNow, turns from t=12 to t=17.\n\ny_t at each turn.\n\nI need to be safe at each turn t from 12 to 17.\n\nt=17 is y=9, safe.\n\nNow, possible to go directly up with 5 U actions, but let's see the times.\n\nIf I go U each time from t=12 to t=16.\n\nThen:\n\nt=12: y=4, safe as we saw.\n\nAction a_12=U, so y_13=5\n\nt=13: y=5, freeway 5, no collision at any time, safe.\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\nt=14: y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\na_14=U, y_15=7\n\nt=15: y=7, freeway 7, but collision at t=15! t=15 is one of the collision times for y=7.\n\nAt t=15, y=7, and freeway 7 has collision at T=15, so I would collide.\n\nNot good.\n\na_15=U, y_16=8\n\nt=16: y=8, freeway 8, collision at T=16, collide.\n\nThen y_17=9, but at t=16 I collide, so dead.\n\nSo direct up not possible.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nt=15 and t=16 are critical.\n\nAlso, y=1 has collision at t=16, but I'm going up, so not relevant.\n\nNow, since I need to reach y=9 at t=17, and start at t=12 y=4.\n\nI have 5 actions to increase by 5, so must be all U, no S or D.\n\nBut with all U, I hit y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16, both collision times.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps stay or go down to avoid those times.\n\nBut I have to go up eventually.\n\nMaybe I can be on different rows at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=15, if I am not on y=7, but on y=6 or y=8, but y=8 has collision at t=15? t=15 and 16 both collision for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both collide at t=15 and t=16.\n\nt=15: y=7 collide\n\nt=16: y=7 and y=8 collide? At t=16, freeway 7 and 8 both have collision.\n\nBut for a given turn, I am only on one row.\n\nBut at t=15, if I am on y=6 or y=8, y=8 at t=15 also collides.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, y=7 or y=8 collide.\n\ny=6 at t=16: freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=15, safe, etc.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=15, I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nAlso, at t=16, y=1 collides, but I won't be there.\n\nSo for t=15, I need y_15 not 7 and not 8.\n\nSimilarly, t=16, y_16 not 7 and not 8.\n\nNow, with all U actions, y_t increases steadily.\n\nBut I can have S or D actions to stay or go down, but then I need more U to compensate, which might take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should avoid extra actions if possible.\n\nWith H=6, T_final=17, I have to reach y_17=9 from y_12=4 in 5 actions, so net +5, so must have exactly 5 U and 0 D, 0 S? Actions from t=12 to t=16, 5 actions.\n\nU - D =5, and U + D + S =5, so if S=0, D=0, U=5; or if D>0, then U must be larger, but U <=5, so U=5, D=0, S=0 is the only possibility. Because U - D =5, U + D <=5 (since S>=0), so U + D <=5, U - D=5, adding: 2U <=10, U<=5, subtracting: -2D <=0, etc. U - D =5, U + D + S =5, S>=0.\n\nFrom U - D =5, and U + D + S =5, subtract the first from the second: (U+D+S) - (U-D) =5-5 => 2D + S =0, so D=0, S=0, then U=5.\n\nSo with 5 actions, must be all U, no choice.\n\nBut with all U, I must be at y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16, both collision times, so impossible to avoid with this path.\n\nTherefore, I need more actions.\n\nMinimal H must be larger than 6.\n\nNext, try H=7.\n\nThen T_final = t₁ + H -1 =12 +7 -1=18.\n\ny_18=9.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=17, 6 actions, to go from y_12=4 to y_18.\n\ny_18 = y_12 + sum Δy from t=12 to 17.\n\nNumber of actions: 6 actions (t=12 to t=17) determine y_13 to y_18.\n\ny_12=4, y_18=9, so net increase 5 in 6 actions.\n\nSo U - D =5\n\nU + D + S =6\n\nThen from U - D =5, U + D + S=6, add: 2U + S =11, subtract: 2D + S =1? Let's see.\n\nU - D =5\n\nU + D + S =6\n\nAdd: 2U + S =11\n\nSubtract: (U+D+S) - (U-D) =6-5 => 2D + S =1\n\nSince S >=0, 2D + S =1, possible if D=0, S=1; or D=1, S=0 but 2*1 +0=2>1, not possible; D=0, S=1: 0 +1=1, yes; or D=1, S=-1 impossible; so only D=0, S=1.\n\nThen from U - D = U =5\n\nSo U=5, D=0, S=1.\n\nOne stay action, and five up.\n\nNow, the stay can be at some turn.\n\nTurns: t from 12 to 17 for positions? Positions at turn τ from 12 to 18.\n\ny_12=4\n\nAfter actions, y_13, y_14, y_15, y_16, y_17, y_18=9\n\nWith U=5, D=0, S=1 in actions from t=12 to t=17.\n\nThe S action means at some turn, I stay, so y_t same as y_{t+1}? No.\n\nAction at time t determines y_{t+1}, but y_t is position at turn t.\n\nWhen I take S at turn t, y_{t+1} = y_t, so at turn t+1, I am at same row as turn t.\n\nSimilarly, U: y_{t+1} = y_t +1\n\nD: y_{t+1} = y_t -1\n\nNow, I need to place the S action so that I avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=15 and t=16.\n\nAlso, t=15 and t=16 are fixed times.\n\nList the sequence of y_t.\n\nStart t=12, y=4\n\nNow, actions at t=12,13,14,15,16,17 (6 actions)\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\ny_13 depends on a_12\n\ny_14 on a_13, etc.\n\ny_18 on a_17\n\nWe need y_18=9\n\nSince U=5, S=1, D=0, the y increases by 1 for U, stays for S.\n\nSo the path must have five increases and one stay.\n\nThe row at each turn:\n\nAt t=12, y=4\n\nThen depending on actions.\n\nI need y_t for t=12 to 18.\n\nBut t=18 is y=9, safe.\n\nCritical t=15 and t=16.\n\ny_15 must not be 7 or 8\n\ny_16 must not be 7 or 8\n\nSince if y_15=7 or 8, collide at t=15; similarly for t=16.\n\nAlso, other times might have issues, but only y=7 and 8 have collisions at t=15,16.\n\ny=1 at t=16, but I won't be there.\n\nNow, with S action, I can stay at some row to avoid moving into collision.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=14, then y_15 = y_14, so if y_14 is not 7 or 8, and y_15 same, safe if y_14 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, possible actions.\n\nFirst, suppose I go up normally but stay at some point.\n\nSince I need to avoid y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16, but with all U, I am at y=7 at t=15 and y=8 at t=16.\n\nIf I insert a stay, I can delay the increase.\n\nFor example, if I take S at t=14, then:\n\nAssume a_12=U, y_13=5\n\nt=13, y=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\nt=14, y=6\n\nNow a_14=S, so y_15=6 (same as y_14)\n\nt=15, y=6, which is not 7 or 8, and freeway 6 no collision, safe.\n\nThen a_15=U, y_16=7\n\nt=16, y=7, but at t=16, y=7 has collision! Freeway 7 at t=16 collides.\n\nProblem.\n\nt=16, y=7, collide.\n\nIf after that, a_16=U, y_17=8\n\nt=17, y=8\n\nBut t=17, what about collision? We have freeway 8 collision at t=15 and 16, but t=17?\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, collision at t=15 and 16 only, as per earlier.\n\nt=17: for y=7, at t=17, δt=17-12=5\n\nFreeway 7: third car, at δt=5, span [-29+30, -18+30]= [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision at t=17 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nt=17, y=8: freeway 8 at t=17, δt=5, no collision.\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=9, good.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7, and t=16 is collision time for y=7.\n\nIn the above, when a_14=S, y_15=6, t=15 y=6 safe.\n\na_15=U, y_16=7, t=16 y=7, but at t=16, freeway 7 collision, so collide.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake S earlier or later.\n\nSuppose I take S at t=13.\n\na_12=U, y_13=5\n\nt=13, y=5\n\na_13=S, y_14=5 (same)\n\nt=14, y=5\n\na_14=U, y_15=6\n\nt=15, y=6, safe (not 7 or 8)\n\na_15=U, y_16=7\n\nt=16, y=7, collide at t=16.\n\nSame issue.\n\na_16=U, y_17=8\n\nt=17, y=8, no collision at t=17? t=17, δt=5, as above, no collision for y=7 or 8.\n\nBut at t=16, I collide.\n\nTake S at t=15.\n\nFirst, a_12=U, y_13=5\n\nt=13, y=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\nt=14, y=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7\n\nt=15, y=7, but t=15 collision! Collide immediately.\n\nNot good.\n\na_12=U, y_13=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7 → collide at t=15\n\nIf I take S at t=15, but at t=15 I am already on y=7, so when I take action, collision is at the start of the turn, before action? The collision is based on position at turn T, which is before action.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, collision is checked, then I take action.\n\nSo if y_T is bad, I collide before taking action.\n\nSo I cannot avoid by taking action; I need y_T safe for each T.\n\nIn this case, at t=15, if y_15=7, I collide regardless of action.\n\nSo I must have y_15 ≠7 and ≠8.\n\nSimilarly for t=16, y_16 ≠7 and ≠8.\n\nNow, with S action, I can have y stay constant at some point.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=14, y=6.\n\nThen if I take S at t=14, y_15=6, so t=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen to avoid y=7 at t=16, I need to not be at y=7 at t=16.\n\nIf I take U at t=15, y_16=7, then t=16 y=7 collide.\n\nIf I take S at t=15, y_16=6, then t=16 y=6, safe.\n\nBut y=6 at t=16 is safe.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 at t=18.\n\ny_18=9.\n\nFrom t=16 y=6, I need to go to y=9 in two actions? y_16=6, then a_16 and a_17.\n\na_16: if U, y_17=7\n\nt=17 y=7, safe? t=17, δt=5, no collision for y=7.\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=8, but we need y_18=9, y_18=8 <9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_18=8, not 9.\n\nI need y_18=9.\n\nIf a_17=U, y_18=9, but from y_17.\n\nIf y_17=8, a_17=U, y_18=9.\n\nBut in above, at t=16 y=6.\n\na_16=U, y_17=7\n\nt=17 y=7\n\na_17=U, y_18=8, only 8.\n\ny_18=8, but we need 9.\n\nNot enough.\n\nBecause I have only 6 actions but one S, so I have only 5 increases, from y_12=4 to y_18=9, net +5, so with S, I can reach max y_18 = y_12 + 5 =9, only if all U and no S, but I have S, so y_18 <=8 if S at some point.\n\ny_12=4\n\nAfter actions, each U increases by 1, S no change.\n\nWith U=5, S=1, y_18 = y_12 + U - D +0*S, but D=0, so y_18 =4 +5 =9, yes, because net 5 increases.\n\nIn the sequence, y_18 = y_12 + sum of Δy from t=12 to 17.\n\nEach Δy is +1 for U, 0 for S, -1 for D.\n\nU=5, S=1, D=0, so sum Δy =5*1 +1*0 +0*(-1)=5, so y_18=4+5=9, yes.\n\nBut in the path, the values matter.\n\nIn my earlier attempt: from t=16 y=6, if I take U at t=16, y_17=7, then at t=17 y=7.\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=8, but y_18=8, not 9.\n\ny_18=8, but we need 9. Contradiction.\n\nWhy? Because to get to y_18, from y_17, a_17 determines y_18.\n\ny_17 must be 8 for y_18=9 with U.\n\nBut in the path, with S at some point, y is lower.\n\nIn the case where I had:\n\nt=12 y=4\n\na_12=U, y_13=5\n\nt=13 y=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\nt=14 y=6\n\na_14=S, y_15=6  (since S)\n\nt=15 y=6\n\na_15=S, y_16=6  (I take S again, but I have only one S to place.\n\nU=5, S=1, D=0, so only one stay.\n\nIn this case, a_14=S, so y_15=6\n\nt=15 y=6\n\nNow a_15, if U, y_16=7, t=16 y=7 collide\n\nIf S, but I have only one S, already used at t=14, so a_15 must be U or D, but D=0, so must be U, so y_16=7, collide.\n\nIf I take S at t=15, but let's see.\n\nSuppose a_12=U, y_13=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7 → but t=15 y=7 collide, not possible.\n\nTake S earlier.\n\na_12=S, y_13=4\n\nt=13 y=4\n\na_13=U, y_14=5\n\nt=14 y=5\n\na_14=U, y_15=6\n\nt=15 y=6, safe\n\na_15=U, y_16=7\n\nt=16 y=7, collide at t=16\n\na_16=U, y_17=8\n\nt=17 y=8, no collision\n\na_17=U, y_18=9\n\nBut at t=16, collide.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=16, after t=15 y=6, if I take S at t=15, y_16=6, then t=16 y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_16=U, y_17=7\n\nt=17 y=7, safe (t=17 no collision)\n\na_17=U, y_18=8, only 8, not 9.\n\ny_18=8 <9.\n\nBut I need y_18=9, so I need another action, but I have only 6 actions, all used.\n\nActions: t=12 to t=17: a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16, a_17\n\nIn this case: a_12=S, y_13=4\n\na_13=U, y_14=5\n\na_14=U, y_15=6\n\na_15=S, but I have only one S, and U=5, but here I have only two U so far, need more U.\n\nList:\n\ny_12=4\n\na_12=S, y_13=4\n\ny_13=4\n\na_13=U, y_14=5\n\ny_14=5\n\na_14=U, y_15=6\n\ny_15=6\n\na_15=U, y_16=7 → but if a_15=U, y_16=7, t=16 y=7 collide\n\na_15=S, y_16=6\n\ny_16=6\n\na_16=U, y_17=7\n\ny_17=7\n\na_17=U, y_18=8\n\ny_18=8 <9, not 9.\n\nBut we need y_18=9, so missing one increase.\n\nBecause I have only four U actions: a_13, a_14, a_16, a_17, and a_12=S, a_15=S, but I have only one S allowed, but here I used two S, which is not possible.\n\nU=5, S=1, so I can have only one stay.\n\nIn the above, if I use only one S, say at a_15.\n\nThen:\n\na_12=U, y_13=5\n\na_13=U, y_14=6\n\na_14=U, y_15=7 → t=15 y=7 collide, not possible.\n\nIf S at a_12:\n\na_12=S, y_13=4\n\na_13=U, y_14=5\n\na_14=U, y_15=6\n\na_15=U, y_16=7 → t=16 y=7 collide\n\na_16=U, y_17=8\n\na_17=U, y_18=9\n\nBut at t=16 collide.\n\nIf I go slower.\n\nPerhaps I need to be at a lower row at t=15.\n\nFor example, at t=15, if I am at y=5, then not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly for t=16.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=15, from y=4 at t=12, with 3 actions, net increase 1, so possible with two U and one S, for example.\n\nBut for H=7, T_final=18, actions from t=12 to t=17 to determine y_13 to y_18.\n\ny_12=4\n\ny_18=9, net +5 in 6 actions.\n\nWith U=5, S=1, D=0.\n\nThe y at t=15: t=15 is after 3 actions?

H=8.\n\nBut earlier with H=6 or 7 not possible, so min H=8.\n\nBut perhaps I can do with H=7 if I use a down action.\n\nEarlier for H=7, I had to have U=5,S=1,D=0, but couldn't avoid collision.\n\nWith D=1.\n\nFor H=7, T_final=18, y_18=9.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=17, 6 actions.\n\ny_18=9, y_12=4, net +5.\n\nU - D =5\n\nU + D + S =6\n\nThen U - D =5\n\nU + D + S =6\n\nSubtract: (U+D+S) - (U-D) =6-5 => 2D + S =1\n\nSo if D=0, S=1, as before, impossible.\n\nIf D=1, S=0, then from 2D + S=2, but equation is 2D + S=1, contradiction.\n\n2D + S =1, with D integer >=0, S>=0.\n\nIf D=0, S=1\n\nIf D=1, S= -1 impossible.\n\nSo only possibility D=0,S=1,U=5, which we saw impossible to avoid collision.\n\nThus H=7 impossible.\n\nTherefore min H=8.\n\nNow, in the path above, I used two S, but with H=8, it works.\n\nPerhaps other paths with down, but might take more turns.\n\nFor example, with down, I might avoid the critical times but need more actions.\n\nSo H=8 seems minimal.\n\nNow, to confirm, the sequence.\n\nt1=12.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd for turn 19: since we reach at turn 19, but the action at turn 19 is included, we can set to S.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nThe answer should list the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=8, so turns 12 to 19.\n\nBut turn 19 action doesn't affect position since we are already at 9.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nFirst, minimal H is 8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  (or U, but S is fine)\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about freeway 1 at t=16, but I was not on it.\n\nIn this path, I was on y=6 at t=16, not y=1.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster with a down action, but I think not necessary.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t=13, and I have car positions and movements given.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. Since all cars are moving right with positive speeds, and for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]. Let me denote t1 as 13 for simplicity.\n\nThe car update for right-moving cars: at time T, span is [τ + s(T - 13), h + s(T - 13)]. Since they're moving right, the head is larger, so the tail is the left end, head is the right end? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, and head is -36, tail is -47. But -36 is greater than -47, so head is the right end, tail is the left end. Then for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T), and for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T, they are on y_T, so they check for collision on y_T at turn T. Only when they are on a freeway at that turn, they need to avoid the car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision check for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nAt each turn T, the player has a position y_T, and they are on freeway y_T for that turn, so they must not have 0 in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen they choose an action U, D, or S, which changes y for the next turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent y=5 at t=13.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up. But there are cars on freeways 1-8, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to find times when for each freeway, at x=0, there is no car covering it.\n\nBut the cars are on specific freeways, so for each freeway, I need to find times when no car on that row has span containing 0 at that time.\n\nThen, I can plan a path through the freeways at safe times.\n\nSince I start at t=13, y=5, and I need to get to y=9, I can move up or down or stay, but since 9 is above 5, I should move up when possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeways: 1 to 8.\n\nFor each, the cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nSo at time T, span: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-13), h + s(T-13)] = [-47 + 12(T-13), -36 + 12(T-13)]\n\nSet this to include 0:\n\n-47 + 12(T-13) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12(T-13)\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSo let k = T - 13, the number of turns from now.\n\nThen for freeway 1 car: [-47 + 12k, -36 + 12k] contains 0 when\n\n-47 + 12k ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 + 12k\n\nWhich is:\n\n12k ≤ 47 and 12k ≥ 36\n\nk ≤ 47/12 = 3.916, so k ≤ 3 since k integer? k is turn offset, integer.\n\nT is turn number, so k = T - 13, integer.\n\nSo k ≤ floor(47/12) but let's calculate inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 12k ≤ 0 => 12k ≤ 47 => k ≤ 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so k ≤ 3 since k integer? k ≤ 3 means 12*3=36 ≤47, yes 36≤47, but 12k≤47, k=3, 36≤47 true; k=4, 48>47, false.\n\nk ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so for k=0,1,2,3: 12k=0,12,24,36 all ≤47? 36≤47 true, 48>47 false, so k=0,1,2,3 satisfy 12k≤47.\n\nk=0:12*0=0≤47, true; k=1:12≤47 true; k=2:24≤47 true; k=3:36≤47 true; k=4:48>47 false.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -36 + 12k => 12k ≥ 36 => k ≥ 3.\n\nSo both: k ≥ 3 and k ≤ 3? k ≥3 and k≤3 from above?\n\nk ≥3 from second, and k≤3 from first? No.\n\nFirst: 12k ≤47, which k≤3 since k=3:36≤47, k=4:48>47.\n\nSecond: 12k ≥36, k≥3.\n\nSo k=3 exactly.\n\nFor k=3, T=13+3=16.\n\nAt T=16, k=3, span: -47 + 12*3 = -47+36= -11, and -36+12*3= -36+36=0.\n\nSo [ -11, 0], which contains 0.\n\nFor other k, not both satisfied. For example k=2: 12k=24, -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, both negative, 0 not in [-23,-12]. k=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in it. So only at k=3, T=16, collision on freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, so if I am on freeway 1 at turn 16, I collide. Otherwise not.\n\nNow, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: (30,19,right,6) but head 30, tail 19? 30>19, so for right-moving, tail is left end, head right end.\n\nAt time T, span [19 + 6(k), 30 + 6(k)] where k=T-13.\n\nSet [19+6k, 30+6k] contains 0.\n\n19+6k ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 30+6k? But 19+6k ≤0 implies 6k ≤ -19, k≤ -19/6≈ -3.166, but k≥0, so impossible since 19+6k ≥19>0 for k≥0. So 0 is never in the span because the car is at x around 19 to 30, moving right, so it's always positive, never reaches 0. Similarly, for freeway 3,4,5,6, all have the same car: (30,19,right,6), so same thing, never at x=0.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5,6 each have one car (30,19,right,6), so all never have x=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFirst car (30,19,right,6): as above, span [19+6k,30+6k], always positive for k≥0, so 0 not in it.\n\nSecond car (-48,-59,right,6): head -48, tail -59, so for right-moving, span [τ + s(k), h + s(k)] = [-59 + 6k, -48 + 6k]\n\nSet to contain 0: -59+6k ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48+6k\n\nSo 6k ≤ 59, k≤59/6≈9.833, so k≤9\n\nAnd 6k ≥48, k≥8\n\nSo k=8,9\n\nFor k=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0] contains 0\n\nk=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6] contains 0\n\nThird car (-12,-23,right,6): span [-23 +6k, -12 +6k]\n\nContain 0: -23+6k ≤0 and 0≤ -12+6k\n\n6k≤23, k≤23/6≈3.833, k≤3\n\n6k≥12, k≥2\n\nSo k=2,3\n\nk=2: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [-11,0] contains 0\n\nk=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, [-5,6] contains 0\n\nNow for freeway 7, collision when any car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at k=2 and k=3 from third car, and k=8,9 from second car.\n\nAlso first car never, so unsafe at k=2,3,8,9 i.e. T=15,16,21,22\n\nT=13+k, so k=2 T=15, k=3 T=16, k=8 T=21, k=9 T=22\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at same times: k=2,3,8,9 or T=15,16,21,22\n\nNow freeway 1: only unsafe at T=16, as we had.\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: each has one car (30,19,right,6), which is always safe, never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5,6 all have only one car each, (30,19,right,6), which as above, min x is 19+6k ≥19>0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\nNow, I start at t=13, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and I am on y=5 at t=13.\n\nI need to check if y=5 is safe at t=13.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5? Freeways y=1 to 8, so y=5 is row 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has one car: (30,19,right,6), which is safe at all times, as above.\n\nSo at t=13, on y=5, no collision, safe.\n\nNow, I can choose actions: U to go up, D down, S stay.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy: U:+1, D:-1, S:0, and y between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=5, need to go to y=9, so I should move up when possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe for that turn.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway, at the times when it is unsafe, I should not be on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, since I can stay or move vertically, I need to time my vertical movements to avoid the unsafe times on the rows I cross.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from 5 to 9, that's 4 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid, so H might be more than 4.\n\nBut I should aim for minimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\nFreeway y=1: unsafe only at T=16\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=15,16,21,22\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, only y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, so always safe.\n\nI start at (0,5), which is on freeway 5? At turn t, position (0,y_t), and if y_t between 1 and 8, it's on freeway y_t.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), which is not on any freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince I start at t=13, y=5.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\nFor row 7 and 8: unsafe at t=15,16,21,22\n\nRow 1 unsafe at t=16\n\nOthers always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nThe rows between: y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at 15,16,21,22\n\ny=8 unsafe at 15,16,21,22\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSince I start at t=13, I can move immediately.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=13 onwards.\n\nAt t=13, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up each turn.\n\nBut I might hit unsafe rows at bad times.\n\nOption: go up at t=13 to y=6.\n\nt=13: at y=5, choose action for next position.\n\nThe position is updated after action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAnd at turn t, I am on y_t, so collision check for y_t at t.\n\nThen at t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, collision for y_{t+1} at t+1.\n\nSo sequence of positions and turns.\n\nStart: t=13, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, I can choose a_{13}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{14} = 6.\n\nIf D, y_{14}=4, but that might be away from goal, probably not helpful.\n\nS, stay at 5.\n\nSimilarly for other actions.\n\nSince I need to go up, U is better.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nt=15 and 16 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nt=21 and 22 also, but later.\n\nSince I start at t=13, I can reach y=9 quickly if I avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go up directly:\n\nt=13: y=5, safe. Action U: then y_{14}=6\n\nt=14: at y=6, which is freeway 6, always safe. Action U: y_{15}=7\n\nt=15: at y=7, but t=15 is unsafe for y=7, since freeway 7 unsafe at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, on y=7, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at t=16, also unsafe.\n\nt=15 and 16 both unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut I might go later or earlier.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can stay at y=6 for some turns to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThen go up when safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe only at t=15,16,21,22.\n\nOther times are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 unsafe at t=16, but I am not on y=1, starting from 5, going to 9, so y=1 is below, I don't need to go there.\n\nSo only relevant are y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=6 is safe always, y=5 safe, etc.\n\nTo go from y=5 to y=9, I need to pass through y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nThe critical part is crossing y=7 and y=8 during safe times.\n\nSafe times for y=7: all times except t=15,16,21,22. So safe at t=13,14,17,18,19,20,23,... etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, at t=13, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen, if I go to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 unsafe for y=7, so I cannot.\n\nI could go to y=7 at t=14? How?\n\nAt t=13, y=5, if I go U, y_{14}=6.\n\nThen at t=14, y=6, if I go U, y_{15}=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf at t=13, I go U to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, instead of going up, I could stay or go down, but going down is bad.\n\nOr stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nt=14: at y=6, choose S, then y_{15}=6 still.\n\nThen at t=15, on y=6, safe, since y=6 always safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=7 at t=16? But t=16 is unsafe for y=7.\n\ny_{16}=7 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo to y=7 later.\n\nFor example, after t=16.\n\nt=17 is safe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nt=13: y=5, safe\n\nAfter action, y_{14} depends on a_{13}\n\nI need to output actions starting from t=13.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t=13, t=14, etc.\n\nNow, minimal H, so I want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe earliest possible: if no cars, from y=5 to y=9 in 4 moves: U,U,U,U, at t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8, t=17 y=9.\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 unsafe, and t=16 y=8 unsafe if I go directly.\n\nt=15 y=7 unsafe, t=16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=16 y=8, which is unsafe at t=16.\n\nSo not possible directly.\n\nI need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can stay at y=6 for a few turns until after t=16.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=13: start y=5, safe. Action U: go to y=6 at t=14.\n\nt=14: y=6, safe. Now, if I go U, y_{15}=7, unsafe at t=15.\n\nSo instead, at t=14, choose S: stay at y=6, so y_{15}=6.\n\nt=15: at y=6, safe. Now, if I go U to y=7 at t=16, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to wait until t=17 to go to y=7.\n\nSo at t=15, choose S again: y_{16}=6.\n\nt=16: at y=6, safe. Now, t=16 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8, but I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, I can choose U: go to y=7 at t=17.\n\nt=17: at y=7, now t=17, which is safe for y=7, since unsafe only at 15,16,21,22. t=17 is safe.\n\nThen action U: go to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18: at y=8, t=18 safe? Unsafe at 15,16,21,22, so t=18 safe.\n\nThen action U: go to y=9 at t=19.\n\nt=19: at y=9, safe, goal.\n\nNow, H: from t=13 to t=19, that's 6 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at t=13, after H actions, at turn t=13 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- t=13: position y=5, after action a_{13}, next position.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, stay, I stay at y=5.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- At t=13: y_13=5, choose a_{13}=U, so y_{14}=6\n\n- t=14: y_14=6, choose a_{14}=S (stay), so y_{15}=6\n\n- t=15: y_15=6, choose a_{15}=S, so y_{16}=6\n\n- t=16: y_16=6, choose a_{16}=U, so y_{17}=7\n\n- t=17: y_17=7, choose a_{17}=U, so y_{18}=8\n\n- t=18: y_18=8, choose a_{18}=U, so y_{19}=9\n\nNow at t=19: y_19=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\n- t=13: y=5, safe\n\n- t=14: y=6, safe\n\n- t=15: y=6, safe\n\n- t=16: y=6, safe\n\n- t=17: y=7, t=17, which is not 15,16,21,22, so safe\n\n- t=18: y=8, t=18, safe\n\n- t=19: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1? The sequence of actions is from t=13 to t=18, that's 6 actions: a13 to a18, and after a18, y19=9.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at turn t=19.\n\nMinimal number of turns H: since I start at t=13, and reach at t=19, the number of turns elapsed is 6, but H is the number of actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt1 =13, so actions for t from 13 to 13+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet t1=13.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, position at t1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions from t=13 to t=18, that's H=6 actions, y_{19} =9, since t1 + H =13 +6=19.\n\nt1 + H = turn after H actions.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I do with fewer than 6 actions?\n\nMinimal to go up is 4 actions: from y=5 to y=9 in 4 ups.\n\nBut with obstacles, I might need more.\n\nIn this case, because of unsafe times at t=15 and 16 for y=7 and 8.\n\nThe next safe time after t=16 for y=7 is t=17.\n\nBut I need to be at y=7 at a safe time.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, from start, I can go to y=6 quickly.\n\nAt t=13, y=5, go U to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, I can go to y=7 immediately at t=15, but t=15 unsafe.\n\nI cannot go to y=7 before t=15? t=14 is possible? How?\n\nAt t=13, y=5, if I go U, y14=6.\n\nIf at t=13 I go U, y14=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=14, I need to have moved at t=13 to y=7, but from y=5, I can only go to y=6 or 4 or stay, not directly to 7. So I cannot be at y=7 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest I can be at y=7 is t=15, by going U at t=13 and U at t=14.\n\nBut t=15 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at y=8, earliest t=16 if I go up directly, but unsafe.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=15 or t=16.\n\nThe next possible time to be on y=7 is t=17.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 at t=17, I need to be at y=6 at t=16 or earlier, and go U at t=16.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, from start, at t=13, y=5.\n\nI can go to y=6 at t=14 by U at t=13.\n\nThen at t=14, y=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 until t=16.\n\nAt t=14, choose S, so y15=6.\n\nt=15, y=6, choose S, y16=6.\n\nt=16, y=6, choose U, y17=7.\n\nt=17, y=7, choose U, y18=8.\n\nt=18, y=8, choose U, y19=9.\n\nAs before, 6 actions.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at t=17, but I need to get there.\n\nt=17 is the earliest safe time for y=7 after t=16.\n\nt=14 is safe, but I cannot reach y=7 at t=14.\n\nBecause from t=13 y=5, after one action, at t=14, I can be at y=6 or y=4 or y=5, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=15 and 16 unsafe.\n\nSo t=17 is the earliest possible to be on y=7 safely.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=18 or later.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSo it seems 6 actions is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster by not staying.\n\nFor example, at t=13, go U to y=6 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, instead of staying, can I go somewhere else? But I need to go up.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at a safe time earlier? But y=8 unsafe at t=15,16, so earliest safe is t=17.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, I need to be at y=7 at t=16 and go U, but t=16 y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nOr from y=6 at t=16 go U to y=7 at t=17, then to y=8 at t=18.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go directly to y=8 at t=17? From where?\n\nAt t=16, if I am at y=7, but cannot at t=16.\n\nOr at y=9? No.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems optimal: 6 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =13: a_{13} = U  (to go to y=6)\n\nIn the sequence: at t=13, action U, so y14=6.\n\nThen turn t=14: a_{14} = S  (stay, so y15=6)\n\nt=15: a_{15} = S  (stay, y16=6)\n\nt=16: a_{16} = U  (to y=7 at t=17)\n\nt=17: a_{17} = U  (to y=8 at t=18)\n\nt=18: a_{18} = U  (to y=9 at t=19)\n\nNow, at t=19, y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5?\n\nSuppose H=5 actions, then I reach at turn t=13+5=18.\n\ny_{18}=9.\n\nNow, from y=5 to y=9 in 5 actions, but since each action can change by at most 1, I need at least 4 ups, so with 5 actions, I can have 4 ups and one stay or down, but down would require extra up, so probably 4 ups and one stay, or 5 ups if possible, but from 5 to 9, 4 steps, so with 5 actions, I must have one action that doesn't increase y, like S or D.\n\nBut D would make me go down, which is worse.\n\nSo best is 4U and 1S.\n\nNow, I need y_{18}=9.\n\nThe position sequence.\n\nStart t=13, y=5.\n\nAfter a13, y14\n\na14, y15\n\na15, y16\n\na16, y17\n\na17, y18=9\n\nNow, y18=9, so at some point I must have increased y.\n\nThe net change: from y13=5 to y18=9, increase of 4 in 5 steps, so sum of Δy =4.\n\nEach Δy: U:+1, D:-1, S:0.\n\nSo need four +1 and one 0, or other combinations, but since +1 and -1 would cancel, but I need net +4, so must have at least four U, and the other must be S or D, but D would require extra U, so for net +4 in 5 steps, I must have exactly four U and one S.\n\nThree U and one D and one S would be net +2, not enough. Etc.\n\nSo only possibility: four U and one S.\n\nNow, the S must be at some point where I don't move.\n\nNow, I need to avoid collisions, especially at y=7 and y=8.\n\ny18=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the times: t=13 to t=17 for actions, positions from t=13 to t=18.\n\ny_t at t=13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nI need to be safe at each of these turns.\n\nt=13: y=5, safe.\n\nt=18: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, t=15 and t=16 are critical for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince I have to be on y=7 and y=8 at some points.\n\nIn the path, I must pass through y=7 or y=8, but I could skip if I go directly, but no, from y=6 to y=8 directly? No, each move changes y by at most 1, so I must be on y=7 and y=8 at some consecutive turns.\n\nFor example, to go from y=6 to y=8, I need to be at y=7 in between.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo in the sequence, there must be some t where y_t=7, and some t where y_t=8.\n\nNow, for y_t=7, it must not be at t=15 or 16 or 21 or 22, but since we are around t=13-18, only t=15 and 16 are relevant.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, for H=5, we have positions at t=13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\ny_t for t=13 to 18.\n\ny18=9.\n\nSince net +4 from t=13 to t=18, with one S, so y increases at four steps.\n\nNow, suppose I have the stay at an early turn.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: at t=13, S, so y14=5.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nBut y14=5, then to y=9 in four ups, but that would be y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9.\n\nBut y16=7 at t=16, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\nThen if a14=S, y15=6\n\nThen a15=U, y16=7, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\na15=U to y16=7, unsafe.\n\nIf a14=U, y15=7, unsafe at t=15.\n\nWorse.\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps stay later.\n\nBut with only one stay.\n\nSuppose at t=13, U, y14=6\n\na14=U, but cannot, unsafe.\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\nThen a14=S, y15=6\n\nNow, if I go up at t=15: a15=U, y16=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay again, but I have only one S in five actions? For H=5, I have five actions, but one must be S.\n\nIn this case, with a14=S, then I have to move.\n\na15 must be U or D, but D bad.\n\nIf a15=U, y16=7, unsafe.\n\nIf a15=D, y16=5, then I need to go up, but y16=5, then to y18=9, need three ups: y17=6, y18=7? y18=9, so y17=8 or something.\n\ny16=5, then a16=U, y17=6\n\na17=U, y18=7? But y18=7, not 9.\n\ny18=9, so from y16=5, to y18=9, need two steps: impossible, since each step max +1.\n\ny18 must be from y17 + Δy.\n\ny17 can be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=9 max? y between 0 and 9.\n\ny17 can be 8, then U to 9; or 9, S; or 10 not possible.\n\nBut from y16=5, to y17: can be 4,5,6.\n\nThen y17=6, then y18=7,8,9.\n\nIf y17=6, y18=7, not 9.\n\nIf y17=7, y18=8 or 9? If U to 8, or if from 7 to 9 directly no.\n\nSo to have y18=9, y17 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y17=8, a17=U to y18=9.\n\nIf y17=9, a17=S or D, but y18=9.\n\nBut with y16=5, y17 can be 4,5,6, none of which is 8 or 9, so impossible to have y17=8 or 9 from y16=5.\n\nThus, if I go down to y=5 at some point, I cannot reach y=9 in time with few actions.\n\nTherefore, for H=5, I must not go down, and have the stay at y=6 or something.\n\nBut as before, if I stay at y=6 at some point, say t=14 or t=15.\n\nBut if I stay at t=14, y15=6, then I need to go to y=7 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nBut t=16 unsafe, t=17 possible.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=17, to y=8 at t=18, then to y=9 at t=19, but with H=5, y18=9, so I need to be at y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut if at t=17 I am at y=7, then a17=U, y18=8, not 9.\n\nIf at t=17 y=8, a17=U, y18=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nNow, y17=8.\n\nFrom start, how to reach y=8 at t=17.\n\ny17=8.\n\nThen a17=U to y18=9.\n\nNow, y17=8.\n\nI need to be at y=7 at t=16 or earlier and go U.\n\nBut t=16 unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIf at t=16 y=7, go U to y=8 at t=17, but t=16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=16 y=8, but to be at y=8 at t=16, need from t=15, etc., but t=16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nNo safe way to be on y=7 or y=8 at t=16.\n\nt=17 is the earliest safe for y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=17, I can have y16=6, a16=U to y17=7.\n\nThen y17=7, but I need y18=9, so from y17=7, to y18=9, impossible in one step.\n\nThus, with H=5, I cannot reach y=9 at t=18 because I need to be at y=7 or y=8 at some point, but the safe times don't allow reaching y=9 by t=18.\n\nSpecifically, to have y18=9, y17 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny17=9 not possible earlier, or if y17=8, then I need to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, I need to be at y=7 at t=16 and go U, but t=16 y=7 unsafe; or at y=8 at t=16 and stay, but t=16 unsafe; or from y=9, but no.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 safely at t=17 or earlier except after t=16.\n\nBut after t=16, t=17 is safe, but to be at y=8 at t=17, I must have been at y=7 at t=16 or y=8 at t=16 or y=9 at t=16, all not possible safely.\n\ny at t=16 can be 7 or 8, both unsafe.\n\nIf y16=6, then y17=7, not 8.\n\nCannot be y=8 at t=17 directly.\n\nThus, it is impossible to have y18=9 with H=5 actions.\n\nTherefore, H=6 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=6, I reach at t=19.\n\nNow, but there are unsafe times at t=21,22, but since I reach at t=19, before that, no issue.\n\nNow, in my sequence, I used two stays at y=6.\n\nBut I could have done with one stay? In H=6, I have two S? In the sequence: a13=U, a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U. So two S and three U? From y=5 to y=9, increase of 4, with 6 actions, so net +4, so I can have four U and two S, or other, but in this case, I have three U and two S? y13=5, y14=6 (U), y15=6 (S), y16=6 (S), y17=7 (U), y18=8 (U), y19=9 (U). So actions: U, S, S, U, U, U. So three U and two S? But from y13=5 to y19=9, that's +4, with 6 actions: three U (+3), two S (0), and one U at end? a13=U (+1), a14=S (0), a15=S (0), a16=U (+1), a17=U (+1), a18=U (+1), so four U and two S, net +4.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have fewer stays if I go up faster, but not possible due to unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=6 and stay only one turn, but then I have to be on y=7 at t=17, etc., same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to other rows, but all other rows are safe, but I need to go up.\n\nFor example, from y=5, I could go down, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output for each turn starting from t=13.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, actions:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 19, position (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, I have from t=13 to t=18.\n\nt=13 to t=18 inclusive, that's 6 turns.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, with t1=13.\n\nSo t=0: a_{13}, t=1: a_{14}, ..., t=5: a_{18} for H=6.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is U for t=13\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} S for t=14\n\netc.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, there are also unsafe at t=21,22, but I am done before that, so no problem.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, unsafe at t=16, but I am on y=6 at that time, not y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I am on y=7 at t=17, is it safe? t=17 not in {15,16,21,22}, so yes.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=18, safe.\n\nNow, but let me double-check the car positions at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=17, k=T-13=17-13=4.\n\nFor freeway 7: cars.\n\nFirst car (30,19,right,6): span [19+6*4, 30+6*4] = [19+24,30+24]=[43,54], not contain 0.\n\nSecond car (-48,-59,right,6): span [-59 +6*4, -48 +6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], not contain 0.\n\nThird car (-12,-23,right,6): span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=18, k=5.\n\nFreeway 8: same cars? Freeway 8 has the same: (30,19,right,6), etc.\n\nSpan: [19+30,30+30]? k=5, [19+30,30+30]? s=6, k=5, [19+30? 6*5=30, yes [19+30,30+30]=[49,60]\n\n[-59+30, -48+30]=[-29,-18]\n\n[-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18], all not contain 0.\n\nAnd t=18 not unsafe time.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have two stays, but I could have moved to y=7 at t=14? Cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, and I need to be at y=7 at safe time, but I could be on y=7 at t=14? Impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 directly, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, minimal H=6, with the sequence above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 1 has car, but I didn't go there.\n\nSo.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nAlso, I need to specify the minimal H, but in the sequence it's implied.\n\nThe output is the sequence, and H is the number.\n\nBut in the box, I think just the sequence with turns.\n\nNow, write it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Times\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe only at turn 16 (since \\(0 \\in [-11, 0]\\)).\n- **Freeways 2-6**: Always safe (car spans never contain 0).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turns 15, 16, 21, and 22.\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns 15, 16, 21, and 22.\n\nThe player must avoid being on freeways 7 or 8 at turns 15 and 16, and on freeway 1 at turn 16. Since the goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is always safe, the critical segment is traversing freeways 7 and 8 during safe times (turns 17 and later).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Minimally\n- At turn 13, start at \\(y = 5\\) (safe). Move up to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 14.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 6\\) (safe). Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 15 to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15 (unsafe).\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 6\\) (safe). Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 16 to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16 (unsafe).\n- At turn 16, \\(y = 6\\) (safe). Move up to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 17 (turn 17 is safe for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- At turn 17, \\(y = 7\\) (safe). Move up to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 18 (turn 18 is safe for \\(y = 8\\)).\n- At turn 18, \\(y = 8\\) (safe). Move up to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 19, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence uses 6 actions (turns 13 to 18) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The current turn is t₁ = 14. I can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y=k, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only check the car on the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t₁=14, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 12. Since it's right-moving, span at t=14 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? The notation says for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor freeway 1: at t₁=14, Span = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] since it's right-moving? But it says head h and tail τ, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is head.\n\nIn the table it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12.\n\nSince right-moving, at t₁, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24].\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT] where ΔT = T - 14.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow collision if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=6 at t=14, and I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=9 might be safe, but I need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, I move to y=9.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis y=0 to 9, and I'm at x=0, I think we're always at x=0, since it's a vertical position, and cars are on the freeways which are horizontal at each y-level, I assume.\n\nThe position is (0, y), and cars are on freeways y=1 to 8, moving left or right, but since we're at x=0, we care when the car span includes x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to see if at x=0, it is covered by a car span.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=6 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nFirst, what's the minimum H? If I could go directly up, U,U,U, from 6 to 7,7 to 8,8 to 9, so in 3 turns, I could be at y=9 at turn t=16? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t=14, I am at y=6.\n\nAfter action at t=14, I move to y at t=15.\n\nTurn t: I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=14, I take a_{14}, which sets y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}.\n\nThen at t=15, I take a_{15}, set y_{16}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t} for t from 14 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and collision if for freeway k=y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAnd when I move, at turn T, if I go from y_T to y_{T+1}, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision check for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nOnly check the current y_T at each turn.\n\nNow, I start at t=14, y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so at some future turn, say T, y_T =9.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, min turns to go from 6 to 9 is 3 turns: up, up, up, so at turn t=14,15,16 actions, and y=7 at t=15, y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17.\n\ny at turn t: at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, I am at y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 14: y=6\n\n- After a_{14}, y_{15} = y_14 + Δy_{14}\n\n- After a_{15}, y_{16} = y_15 + Δy_{15}\n\n- After a_{16}, y_{17} = y_16 + Δy_{16}\n\nI need y_{17} =9, for example, if I go up three times.\n\nBut y_{17} =9 means at turn 17, I am at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is not a freeway (freeways 1-8), so no cars, so safe. But I need to be at (0,9), which is fine.\n\nBut during the path, when I am at y=7 or y=8, I might collide with cars on those freeways.\n\ny=6 at t=14: I need to check if at t=14, on freeway 6, there is collision.\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each relevant turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFreeways: 1 to 8.\n\nCars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: at t=14, span [-35, -24] for right-moving? Earlier: [τ, h] = [-35, -24], so min x= -35, max x= -24, so x from -35 to -24.\n\n0 is not in [-35,-24], so at t=14, on freeway 1, no collision at x=0.\n\nNow at turn T, span: [ -35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT ] where ΔT = T-14.\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT\n\nSo -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 35 => ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -24 +12ΔT => 24 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 2.\n\nSo for ΔT=2, both: ΔT=2, -35+24= -11 ≤0, and -24+24=0 ≤0, so 0 is included? 0 ≤0 is true, so yes, at ΔT=2, 0 is in [-11, 0].\n\n-24 +12*2 = -24+24=0, so [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so yes, 0 is the upper end.\n\nSo at T=14+2=16, on freeway 1, there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut I may not be on freeway 1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, for other ΔT.\n\nBut for now, freeway 1 has a car at x=0 only at T=16, since ΔT=2.\n\nΔT min and max: from above, ΔT=2 is the only integer where 0 in span.\n\nΔT=2: -11 ≤0 ≤0, yes.\n\nΔT=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=16, freeway 1 has collision at x=0.\n\nBut T=16 is turn 16.\n\nNow, freeway 2: cars: (36,25,right,6)\n\nh=36, τ=25, d=right, s=6.\n\nRight-moving, so span at t=14: [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nThen at T: [25 + 6ΔT, 36 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 25+6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 36+6ΔT? No.\n\n25+6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 36+6ΔT\n\nFirst: 25+6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ -25, impossible since ΔT≥0.\n\nSo 0 cannot be ≤ left end which is 25>0, so 0 not in [25+6ΔT, 36+6ΔT] for any ΔT, since min x is 25 at ΔT=0, increasing.\n\nSo on freeway 2, no car ever at x=0. Safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (36,25,right,6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (36,25,right,6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same (36,25,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same (36,25,right,6)\n\nAll freeways 2 to 6 have identical cars: one car each with [25,36] at t=14, moving right at speed 6, so x always >=25, never at x=0. So all freeways 2,3,4,5,6 are always safe; no collision possible at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: has three cars: (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6) same as above, never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6) — head h=-42, tail τ=-53? Direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-53,-42] at t=14.\n\nThen at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53+6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42+6ΔT\n\nSo -53+6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -42+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -53+6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 53 => ΔT ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so ΔT <=8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42+6ΔT => 42 ≤ 6ΔT => ΔT >=7\n\nSo for ΔT from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔT=7: -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=8: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=9: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=14+7=21 and T=14+8=22, this car has 0 in span.\n\nNow third car on freeway 7: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nh=-6, τ=-17, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t=14: [τ,h] = [-17,-6]\n\nAt T: [-17 +6ΔT, -6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -17+6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -6+6ΔT\n\nSo -17+6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -6+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -17+6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤17 => ΔT ≤ 17/6 ≈2.833, ΔT<=2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6+6ΔT => 6 ≤ 6ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo ΔT=1,2\n\nΔT=1: -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=2: -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=0: [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: [-17+18=1, -6+18=12], [1,12], no.\n\nSo at T=15 and T=16, this car has 0 in span.\n\nT=14 + ΔT, so for ΔT=1, T=15; ΔT=2, T=16.\n\nNow, the first car on freeway 7 never has x=0, so only the second and third cars matter.\n\nSo on freeway 7, collision at x=0 when:\n\n- From third car: at T=15 and T=16\n\n- From second car: at T=21 and T=22\n\nBut T=21 and 22 are later, probably not relevant for min path.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7? \"7 | (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) \"\n\nAnd \"8 | (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) \" identical to 7.\n\nSo freeway 8 has the same: collision at T=15,16 from the third car, and at T=21,22 from the second car.\n\nNow freeway 1: we had collision only at T=16.\n\nFreeway 2-6: no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: collision at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow I start at t=14, y=6.\n\nAt t=14, I am on freeway 6? y=6 is freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has no cars at x=0, as we said, since the car is at [25,36] and moving away.\n\nSo at t=14, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go up directly: at t=14, I take action, say U, then y_{15} = 6 +1 =7.\n\nThen at t=15, I am at y=7.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7.\n\nAt t=15, on freeway 7, is there collision? From above, at T=15, freeway 7 has the third car with span including 0, so yes, collision if I am there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at t=16, freeway 8 has collision at T=16.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nOption 1: Go up at each step.\n\nt=14: at y=6, safe (as above)\n\nAction a_{14} = U, so y_{15} = 7\n\nt=15: now at y=7, freeway 7. At T=15, freeway 7 has collision at x=0, as per above, from the third car (-6,-17,right,6) at ΔT=1, T=15, span [-11,0], includes 0. So collision, not allowed.\n\nIf I stay at t=14: action S, then y_{15} =6, same position.\n\nThen at t=15, I am still at y=6, freeway 6, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen if I go up at t=15, a_{15}=U, then y_{16}=7.\n\nt=16: at y=7, freeway 7. At T=16, freeway 7: from third car, at ΔT=2, T=16, span [-5,6], includes 0. Also, freeway 7 has collision at T=16, yes.\n\nIf I go directly to y=8.\n\nSuppose at t=14, U to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, y=7 collision.\n\nIf I go down? But I need to go up to 9, down might not help.\n\nPerhaps I need to wait or something.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 have collisions at t=15 and t=16, but only at those times, later they might be safe.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, collisions only at t=15 and t=16 from the cars, and at t=21,22 but that's late.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nAt t=17, for freeway 7: let's see if safe.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=3 for t=14.\n\nFor freeway 7, third car: at ΔT=3, span [-17+18=1, -6+18=12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: at ΔT=3, T=17, second car (-42,-53,right,6) at ΔT=3: [-53+18= -35, -42+18= -24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car never, so at T=17, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8 same.\n\nAt T=16, freeway 7 has collision, but T=17 safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same.\n\nNow freeway 1 has collision only at T=16, but I may not be there.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and go up.\n\nNow, min turns: from y=6 to y=9, I need to increase y by 3, so min 3 actions: but depending on when.\n\nBut at t=15 and t=16, freeway 7 and 8 are dangerous if I am on them.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for a turn, then go up later.\n\nOr go up to y=7 at a safe time.\n\ny=6 is always safe, since freeway 6 no issue.\n\ny=5? But I don't need to go down, but maybe to avoid.\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, which has the same as 2-6, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,3,2,1 all safe except freeway 1 at t=16, but I might not be there.\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at t=16.\n\nBut since I start at y=6, and going up, I might not go to y=1.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to be at y=8 at some point to go up to y=9.\n\nAnd y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has collisions at t=15 and t=16, but safe at other times, like t=17.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7, freeway 7, safe except t=15,16.\n\nNow, current turn t=14.\n\nIf I take no action or something.\n\nOption: at t=14, I stay or move.\n\nSuppose I want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nEarliest: if I go up at t=14,15,16, but:\n\nt=14: at y=6, safe.\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=7\n\nt=15: at y=7, but collision at t=15 on freeway 7, so not allowed.\n\nIf I do something else.\n\nAt t=14, stay: a_{14}=S, then y_{15}=6\n\nt=15: at y=6, safe (freeway 6 safe)\n\nThen a_{15}=U, y_{16}=7\n\nt=16: at y=7, freeway 7. At t=16, collision on freeway 7 (as above, span includes 0), so not allowed.\n\nAt t=14, go down? a_{14}=D, then y_{15}=5\n\nt=15: at y=5, freeway 5, which is safe, no cars near 0.\n\nThen I can go up from there, but I need to go to 9, so I have to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at t=15, go U to y=6 at t=16, but at t=16, on y=6 safe, then U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nt=17: at y=7, freeway 7. At t=17, as above, safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nThen from y=7, go U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18: at y=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow at t=18, for freeway 8: ΔT = T-14 =18-14=4\n\nFor freeway 8 cars:\n\nThird car: (-6,-17,right,6) at ΔT=4: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] = [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6) at ΔT=4: [-53+24= -29, -42+24= -18] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car: no, so safe at t=18.\n\nThen a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nt=19: at y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=14 to t=19, 5 actions? Let's list:\n\nt=14: start y=6, action D? I did down first.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=14: at y=6, action a_{14}=D, then y_{15}=5\n\nt=15: at y=5, action a_{15}=U, then y_{16}=6\n\nt=16: at y=6, action a_{16}=U, then y_{17}=7\n\nt=17: at y=7, action a_{17}=U, then y_{18}=8\n\nt=18: at y=8, action a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=9\n\nAt t=19, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t=14 to t=14+H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to start.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=14 + 5? t=14 to t=18 actions, 5 actions, y at t=19=9.\n\nt: after actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, I have set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H-1, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, min H=3: actions at t=14,15,16: U,U,U, then y_{15}=7, y_{16}=8, y_{17}=9, so at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut as we saw, not possible due to collision at t=15 or t=16.\n\nIn the down-up path, with H=5: actions at t=14,15,16,17,18: D,U,U,U,U? In my earlier: actions a14=D, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, then y15=5, y16=6, y17=7, y18=8, y19=9.\n\nAt t=19, y=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 are safe at t=17, I could wait at y=6 until t=16 or something.\n\nAt t=14: I can stay, a14=S, then y15=6\n\nt=15: at y=6, I can stay again, a15=S, y16=6\n\nt=16: at y=6, now at t=16, is freeway 6 safe? Yes, always.\n\nThen a16=U, y17=7\n\nt=17: at y=7, freeway 7 safe as above (t=17)\n\nThen a17=U, y18=8\n\nt=18: at y=8, freeway 8 safe (t=18, ΔT=4)\n\nThen a18=U, y19=9\n\nSame as before, but I stayed at y=6 for two turns, then up, so actions: S,S,U,U,U from t=14 to 18, y19=9, H=5.\n\nBut I can go up earlier if I time it.\n\nAt t=14, if I go up to y=7 at t=15, but t=15 collision.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 at t=17 directly, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at t=14, go down to y=5, but that might take more time.\n\nPerhaps go to y=8 directly, but I can't, only one step.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, but I need to be on y=8 to go up.\n\nNow, freeway 8 is safe at t=17, for example.\n\nAt t=17, on y=8, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17, I need to have been at y=7 or y=9 or something, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}\n\nIf y_{17}=8, then at t=16, I must have been at y=7,8, or9, and took action to set to 8.\n\nBut at t=16, if I am at y=7, and take S, then y_{17}=7, not 8.\n\nTo have y_{17}=8, I must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at t=16, and take action: if at y=7, take U to y=8; if at y=8, take S to stay or U to y=9 or D to y=7, but I want y=8; if at y=9, take D to y=8.\n\nBut since I'm coming from below, likely at y=7 and take U.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at t=17, I need to be at y=7 at t=16 and take U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=16, I need to be at y=6 or7 or8 at t=15 and take appropriate action.\n\nNow, at t=16, if I am at y=7, freeway 7, but at t=16, freeway 7 has collision, so I cannot be at y=7 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=8 at t=16, freeway 8 has collision at t=16.\n\nSo at t=16, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 because of collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=7 or y=8 at turn t=16.\n\nThus, I cannot have y_{17}=8 by being at y=7 at t=16 and taking U, because I can't be at y=7 at t=16.\n\nIf I were at y=8 at t=16 and take S, y_{17}=8, but I can't be at y=8 at t=16 either.\n\nSimilarly, from above, impossible to be at y=7 or y=8 at t=16.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be at y=7 is t=17, as we had earlier.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=18 or something.\n\nLet's find when I can first be at y=7.\n\nAt t=15: if I go to y=7 at t=15, but collision, not possible.\n\nAt t=16: cannot, collision.\n\nAt t=17: no collision, possible.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8: at t=15: if I could be, but from below, at t=14, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at t=15.\n\ny=5,6,7.\n\ny=7 at t=15 collision.\n\ny=8 at t=15: I can only reach if at t=14 I was at y=7 or8 or9 and took action, but I was at y=6, so y_{15} max 7, so y=8 at t=15 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, t=16: y=8 possible only if from y=7 or8 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, if I were at y=7, collision, not possible; if at y=8, but how? Not from start.\n\nSo indeed, cannot be at y=8 at t=16.\n\nEarliest at y=8: t=17 or later.\n\nAt t=17: to be at y=8, I need to be at y=7 or8 or9 at t=16 and take action.\n\nBut at t=16, I cannot be at y=7 or y=8, as established.\n\nWhat about y=9? Not yet.\n\nSo at t=16, I can be at y=5,6, or possibly y=4 etc., but not 7 or 8.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I could be at y=6 or y=5, etc.\n\nThen from there, to y=7 at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen from y=7, I can go to y=8 at t=18.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=19.\n\nNow, to reach y=7 at t=17, I need to be at y=6,7,8 at t=16 and take action to set y_{17}=7.\n\nBut at t=16, I can be at y=6 (since safe), or y=5, etc., but not y=7 or8.\n\nSo if at t=16, I am at y=6, I can take U to y_{17}=7.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=5, take U to y=6? But I want y=7 at t=17.\n\nIf at t=16, y=6, take U, y_{17}=7.\n\nIf at y=7, but cannot be at y=7 at t=16.\n\nSo only way is to be at y=6 at t=16 and take U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at t=16, I can be at y=5,6,7 at t=15 and take action.\n\nBut at t=15, I cannot be at y=7 (collision), so I can be at y=5 or y=6.\n\nIf at y=6, take S to stay at y=6 for t=16.\n\nOr take U, but to y=7, collision.\n\nOr take D to y=5.\n\nBut to have y=6 at t=16, I can:\n\n- At t=15, be at y=6 and take S, y_{16}=6\n\n- Or at y=5 and take U, y_{16}=6\n\n- Or at y=7 and take D, but cannot be at y=7.\n\nNow, at t=15, I can be at y=5 or y=6.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nStart at t=14, y=6.\n\nAt t=14, I can take action:\n\n- S: y_{15}=6\n\n- U: y_{15}=7 but collision at t=15, not possible\n\n- D: y_{15}=5\n\nSo possible actions at t=14: S or D.\n\nIf S, then at t=15, y=6.\n\nThen at t=15, I can take S to stay at y=6 for t=16, or D to y=5 at t=16, or U but to y=7 collision, not allowed.\n\nSo only S or D at t=15 if at y=6.\n\nBut I want to go to y=6 at t=16.\n\nIf I take S at t=15, y_{16}=6.\n\nIf I take D at t=15, y_{16}=5.\n\nThen to have y=6 at t=16, I need to take S at t=15.\n\nIf at t=14 I take D, then y_{15}=5.\n\nThen at t=15, at y=5, I can take U to y_{16}=6, or S to y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nSo I can reach y=6 at t=16 by:\n\n- Path 1: t=14 S, t=15 S → y16=6\n\n- Path 2: t=14 D, t=15 U → y16=6\n\nThen from y=6 at t=16, take U to y_{17}=7\n\nThen at t=17, y=7, safe, take U to y_{18}=8\n\nThen at t=18, y=8, safe, take U to y_{19}=9\n\nNow, in both paths, I reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nWith H=5 actions: from t=14 to t=18.\n\nBut in path 1: actions a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U\n\nPath 2: a14=D, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U\n\nBoth same number of turns.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can I be at y=8 earlier?\n\nEarliest at y=8 is t=18, as above.\n\nAt t=17, I can be at y=7, then to y=8 at t=18.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=8 at t=17?\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=17, need at t=16 to be at y=7 or8 or9 and take action to y=8.\n\nBut at t=16, cannot be at y=7 or8.\n\nIf at t=16, I am at y=9, but not possible.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before t=18? At t=17, if I could be at y=8, but from above, no.\n\nt=17: y=8 only possible from t=16 y=7 or8.\n\nCannot, so y=8 first possible at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at t=19 earliest.\n\nBut what about going directly to y=9 from y=8 at t=18.\n\nBut y=9 at t=19.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 5 actions.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 and 8 are safe at t=17 and later, but I need to be on them.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a different y and come back, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=14, go down to y=5, then at t=15, go down to y=4, but then I have to come up, more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, at t=14, stay, t=15 stay at y=6, then at t=16, instead of going up, I could go up at t=16 to y=17? y=17 not possible, y max 9.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=7 at t=17, but can I reach y=9 faster from there.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=17, I can go U to y=8 at t=18, then U to y=9 at t=19. Still two more actions.\n\nMin is three actions to increase from 6 to 9, but due to obstacles, delayed.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=7 at t=17 with fewer actions?\n\nFrom start, to be at y=7 at t=17, I need to have taken actions that increase y by one, but with waiting.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=14, if I go up immediately, but cannot because of collision at t=15.\n\nSo I must wait until t=16 to go up to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThe waiting is necessary.\n\nWith one wait: at t=14, I can stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=14, I stay, y15=6\n\nThen at t=15, I must stay or go down, since going up to y=7 collision.\n\nIf I go down at t=15, y16=5\n\nThen at t=16, I can go up to y17=6\n\nThen at t=17, go up to y18=7\n\nThen to y19=8, y20=9, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the paths I have with H=5 are minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach at t=18.\n\ny at t=18=9.\n\nTo have y18=9, need y17=8 or9 or10, but y10 not, so y17=8 or9.\n\nIf y17=8, take U to y18=9.\n\nIf y17=9, take S or something.\n\nBut y17=9 not possible earlier.\n\nNow y17=8: to have at t=17 y=8, need at t=16 to be at y=7,8,9 and take action to y=8.\n\nBut at t=16, cannot be at y=7 or8.\n\nIf at t=16, y=9, not possible.\n\nSo impossible to have y17=8.\n\nThus, earliest y=9 is at t=19.\n\nWith H=5 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, for freeway 1, we have collision at t=16, but since I'm not going there, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nIn the path, when I am at y=6 at t=16, freeway 6 is safe.\n\ny=7 at t=17 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=18 safe.\n\nNow, I have two options for the actions.\n\nOption A: stay at y=6 for two turns, then go up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U  (to y=7 at t=17)\n\nAt t=16, action U, so y_{17} = y_{16} +1, since at t=16, y=6, so y_{17}=7\n\nThen Turn 17: U (y_{18}=8)\n\nTurn 18: U (y_{19}=9)\n\nSo actions at t=14 to t=18: S, S, U, U, U\n\nOption B: go down then up.\n\nTurn 14: D (y_{15}=5)\n\nTurn 15: U (y_{16}=6)\n\nTurn 16: U (y_{17}=7)\n\nTurn 17: U (y_{18}=8)\n\nTurn 18: U (y_{19}=9)\n\nSame H=5.\n\nNow, both work, but perhaps I should choose one without unnecessary moves.\n\nIn option A, I stay at y=6, which is safe.\n\nIn option B, I go to y=5 and back, but y=5 is also safe, but extra move.\n\nBut both take same number of turns.\n\nSince the task is to minimize H, and both have H=5, I can choose either.\n\nBut perhaps staying is simpler.\n\nIn the collision definition, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and check collision for that freeway.\n\nIn both sequences, no collision.\n\nNow, but in option B, at t=15, I am at y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has a car (36,25,right,6), which at any time, x from 25+6ΔT to 36+6ΔT, all positive, so x=0 never covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut to be efficient, I think option A is fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach with H=4.\n\nSuppose H=4, actions at t=14,15,16,17.\n\nThen y at t=18 should be 9.\n\ny_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}\n\nIf y_{18}=9, then y_{17} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{17}=8, then take U to y_{18}=9.\n\nIf y_{17}=9, take S, but then I was at y=9 earlier, but not possible.\n\nNow, can y_{17}=8?\n\nAs before, to be at y=8 at t=17, need at t=16 to be at y=7 or 8 and take action to y=8.\n\nBut cannot be at y=7 or 8 at t=16.\n\nIf at t=16, I am at y=6, and take U, y_{17}=7, not 8.\n\nOr take other, but y_{17}=7 max from y=6.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=5 at t=16, take U to y=6, etc.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at t=17.\n\nThus impossible with H=4.\n\nSimilarly, min H=5.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we already considered.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 1 has collision at t=16, but since I'm not on it, fine.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up at t=16 to y=7 at t=17, etc.\n\nNow, I think I can proceed.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, I can use the stay-stay-up-up-up sequence.\n\nOr, since at t=14, I can take S or D, but S is better to not go down.\n\nIn the stay sequence, at t=14 and t=15, I stay at y=6.\n\nThen at t=16, go U to y=7 at t=17.\n\nt=17 at y=7, go U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nt=18 at y=8, go U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn terms of the turn labels.\n\nt_1 =14, so:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = S\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = S\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nAnd at turn 18, after action, y_{19}=9, so at turn 19, position (0,9).\n\nH=5 turns of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be until the action that makes me reach.\n\nIn the answer, it says: a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the text: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 is the turn when I am at y=9.\n\nIn my case, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19\n\nt_1=14, so 14 + H -1 =19, so 13 + H =19, H=6? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19\n\n14 + H -1 =19\n\n13 + H =19, H=6.\n\nBut I have only 5 actions.\n\nMistake.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t_1 =14, I am at position.\n\nI take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, and y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? Not necessarily.\n\nThe position after actions.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at start, turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, I go to y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, to y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, I go to y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when I am at (0,9) is turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the condition, it says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let me read the problem.\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I take no action, H=0, but I need to reach, so H at least 1.\n\nSuppose min, from y=6 to y=9 in 3 actions: a14=U, y15=7; a15=U, y16=8; a16=U, y17=9. So at turn 17, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14 + H -1 =13 + H\n\nSet equal to 17, so 13+H=17, H=4.\n\nActions from t=14 to t=14+H-1=14+4-1=17? t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at these turns.\n\nAfter last action at t=t_1+H-1, I set y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? But the condition says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, I take actions at turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, which are turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt each of these turns, I take an action, which affects the next position.\n\nSpecifically, at turn τ, I take a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo after taking a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, I set y_{ (t_1 + H -1) +1 } = y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means before taking the action at that turn, I am already at y=9.\n\nIn other words, for the last turn in the sequence, turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and I might take an action, but since I'm already at 9, I should take S or something, but I need to be at 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the min path with 3 actions: I reach at turn 17.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =17\n\nt_1=14, so 14 + H -1 =17, 13+H=17, H=4.\n\nActions at t=14,15,16 (since t from 0 to H-1=3, so t=14,15,16)\n\nAt turn 14: take a14, set y15\n\nAt turn 15: take a15, set y16\n\nAt turn 16: take a16, set y17\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{17} should be 9.\n\nIn this case, with actions U,U,U at t=14,15,16, y15=7, y16=8, y17=9, so at turn 17, y=9, which is t_1 + H -1 =14+4-1=17, yes.\n\nIn my earlier collision avoidance, I couldn't do that, but with waiting.\n\nIn my sequence with H=5 for the safe path.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19\n\n14 + H -1 =19, so 13+H=19, H=6.\n\nActions from t=14 to t=14+6-1=19? t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=6, turns 14 to 19 inclusive? t=0: t_1, t=1: t_1+1, ..., t=H-1: t_1+H-1.\n\nSo turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, total H turns.\n\nAfter action at t_1+H-1, I set y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1+H-1, before action.\n\nThe condition is that at turn t_1+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, in the direct path, at turn 17, y=9, with H=4, actions at t=14,15,16.\n\nAt turn 16, I take action to set y17=9, and at turn 17, I am at y=9.\n\nIn my safe sequence, I am at y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo for that, t_1 + H -1 =19\n\n14 + H -1 =19, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions from t=14 to t=19? t_1 to t_1+H-1=14 to 19, but at turn 19, I need to be at y=9, so I must have reached before or at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for the stay-stay-up-up-up, I have:\n\nAt turn 14: y=6, take S, but y15=6 (set for next turn)\n\nAt turn 15: y=6, take S, y16=6\n\nAt turn 16: y=6, take U, y17=7\n\nAt turn 17: y=7, take U, y18=8\n\nAt turn 18: y=8, take U, y19=9\n\nAt turn 19: y=9\n\nNow, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is y at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 =19, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions at turns t=14 to t=19? t_1 to t_1+H-1=14 to 19.\n\nAt turn 19, I am at y=9, and I need to take an action, but since I'm at y=9, I can take S, for example, to stay, but y20=9, but I don't care, as long as at turn 19, I am at 9.\n\nIn the action at turn 19, I can take S, and y20=9, but at turn 19, position is y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, for turns 14 to 18, I have actions, and at turn 19, I take an action, but since I'm already at 9, I take S.\n\nBut in this case, with H=6, I have an extra action at turn 19.\n\nBut I can finish earlier.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 18, after taking U, y19=9, and at turn 19, I am at y=9, so if I set H such that t_1+H-1=18, then at turn 18, I need y=9.\n\nBut at turn 18, in the sequence, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at turn t_1+H-1=9.\n\nIn the path, earliest at turn 19.\n\nSo I must have t_1+H-1=19, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions at t=14 to t=19.\n\nAt t=14 to t=18, I take actions to move, and at t=19, I take an action, but since I'm at y=9, I take S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nFor the minimal H, with the obstacles, I reach at turn 19, so t=19 is when I am at y=9.\n\nThus for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{19} =9, so t_1 + H -1 =19, 14 + H -1=19, H=6.\n\nActions from t=14 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, I need to take an action, but I'm already at y=9, so I take S.\n\nThe actions before: from t=14 to t=18, I have the moves.\n\nIn the sequence: turns 14,15,16,17,18: actions to get to position, and turn 19: action S to stay.\n\nBut at turn 19, after action S, y20=9, but at turn 19, I am at y=9 before action? Let's see.\n\nAt turn τ, I am at position y_τ.\n\nThen I take action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nThen at next turn τ+1, I am at y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo at turn τ, before action, I am at y_τ.\n\nAfter action, I set y_{τ+1} for the next turn.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I take an action, but the position is already y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nTo have reached at that turn, I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the action sequence, I take actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, but the last action at t_1+H-1 may not affect the position at that turn, but since I'm already there, I can take S.\n\nIn my case, with the sequence, I am at y=9 at turn 19, so for t_1+H-1=19, H=6.\n\nActions: for t=14 to 18: as before, and at t=19: S.\n\nBut I can have a sequence where at turn 18, I am at y=9.\n\nBut is it possible?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at turn 17, then at turn 17 take U to y=9 at turn 18, so at turn 18, y=9.\n\nBut can I be at y=8 at turn 17?\n\nAs before, to be at y=8 at turn 17, need at turn 16 to be at y=7 or 8 and take action to y=8.\n\nBut at turn 16, cannot be at y=7 or 8.\n\nIf at turn 16, I am at y=6, take U to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, y=7, take U to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, y=8, take U to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo at turn 18, y=8, not 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before turn 19.\n\nThus, earliest at turn 19.\n\nTherefore, for the sequence, with H=6, actions at t=14 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, I take S to stay at y=9.\n\nThe actions at t=14 to t=18 are to move up.\n\nFor example, in stay-stay-up-up-up-S sequence:\n\nTurn 14: S (y15=6)\n\nAt turn 14, action S, y_{15} = y_{14} + 0 = 6+0=6\n\nAt turn 15: y=6, take S, y16=6\n\nAt turn 16: y=6, take U, y17=7\n\nAt turn 17: y=7, take U, y18=8\n\nAt turn 18: y=8, take U, y19=9\n\nAt turn 19: y=9, take S, y20=9 (but not necessary, but since we take action)\n\nNow, for the answer, the sequence of actions.\n\nSince at turn 19, I am at y=9, and I take S, but the position is already 9 at turn 19.\n\nIn the other option with down-up.\n\nBut I think the first is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, I think I covered all.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=16 collision, but not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, t_1=14, so 14 + H -1 =19, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions from t=14 to t=19.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nIn the action at turn 19, S is to stay, but since I'm at y=9, it's fine.\n\nI could not include the last S, but the sequence must have H actions, including up to the turn where I am at 9.\n\nIn the condition, when I am at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and I take an action, which could be S.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: S\n}\n\nBut at turn 19, taking S is not necessary, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 19, and I need to specify the action at that turn.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where at turn 18 I am at y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo this should be it.\n\nBut H=6, with 6 actions.\n\nMinimal since I reach at turn 19.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 19 with fewer actions by moving faster, but I can't due to obstacles.\n\nFor example, if I go down and up, but in the down-up path: at t=14 D, y15=5; t=15 U, y16=6; t=16 U, y17=7; t=17 U, y18=8; t=18 U, y19=9; then at t=19, y=9, same as before, but I have actions at t=14 to t=18, 5 actions, but to have y at turn 19, I need t_1+H-1=19, so H=6, so I need to include turn 19 action.\n\nIn the down-up path, with actions at t=14,15,16,17,18: D,U,U,U,U, then at turn 18, after action, y19=9, so at turn 19, I am at y=9, but the action at turn 19 is not taken yet.\n\nFor the sequence, to have turn t_1+H-1=19, I need to include action at t=19.\n\nSo in both cases, I need an action at t=19.\n\nIn the stay path, at t=19 I take S.\n\nIn the down-up path, at t=19 I would take S as well.\n\nBut the down-up path has an extra down and up, but in terms of number of actions to reach, it's the same H=6, since I reach at turn 19.\n\nIn down-up: actions t=14 D, t=15 U, t=16 U, t=17 U, t=18 U, then at t=19 S.\n\nBut at t=18 U, y19=9, so at t=19 y=9, take S.\n\nCompared to stay: t=14 S, t=15 S, t=16 U, t=17 U, t=18 U, t=19 S.\n\nThe stay has two S at beginning, down-up has D and U, but both have 6 actions with the last S.\n\nBut in down-up, at t=14 D, I go to y=5, which is fine, but unnecessary move.\n\nI think the stay sequence is better, as it doesn't move away.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but we checked.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 7, at t=15 and t=16 collision, but in my path, I am on y=7 at t=17, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 6. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis and Path Justification\n- **Initial Position (Turn 14)**: The player is at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 has a car at \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 6)\\), which never occupies \\(x = 0\\) (since its position is always \\(x \\geq 25\\)), so it is safe.\n- **Freeway 7 and 8 Hazards**: \n  - Freeway 7 has cars that cause collisions at turns 15 and 16:\n    - Car \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\) occupies \\(x = 0\\) at turns 15 and 16.\n    - Car \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 6)\\) occupies \\(x = 0\\) at turns 21 and 22, but these are later and irrelevant for the minimal path.\n  - Freeway 8 has identical cars and collision times (15 and 16) due to the same car configurations.\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are safe at turn 17 and later, as no car occupies \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Other Freeways**: \n  - Freeways 2-6 have cars (e.g., \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 6)\\) that never occupy \\(x = 0\\) (always \\(x \\geq 25\\)), so they are always safe.\n  - Freeway 1 has a collision at turn 16, but the player never uses this freeway.\n\nThe direct path (U, U, U) from turn 14 to 16 would place the player:\n- At turn 15 on freeway 7 (collision).\n- At turn 16 on freeway 8 (collision).\n\nThus, the player must delay moving to \\(y = 7\\) until turn 17, when freeway 7 is safe. Similarly, \\(y = 8\\) is first safe at turn 18. The earliest possible arrival at \\(y = 9\\) is turn 19.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence involves:\n- Staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 14 and 15 (actions S, S) to avoid collisions on freeways 7 and 8 at turns 15 and 16.\n- Moving up at turn 16 to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17 (action U), when freeway 7 is safe.\n- Moving up at turn 17 to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18 (action U), when freeway 8 is safe.\n- Moving up at turn 18 to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19 (action U).\n- At turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), so action S is taken to stay, completing the sequence with \\(y_{19} = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{19} = 9\\) with \\(H = 6\\).\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe actions for turns 14 to 19 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: S \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) at turn 15 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car, meaning the car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision at turn T, I only care about cars on my current y_T.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=15. I need to simulate where the cars are at future turns based on their movement.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn 15.\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car, (-12, -23, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, head is at -12? No, the span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] which is [tail, head]? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head is the front, I assume.\n\nLook at freeway 7 and 8: they have (0, -11, right, 6), which at turn 15, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for right-moving? But it says (head, tail) is (0, -11), so if head is 0, tail is -11, and it's right-moving, so the span should be from tail to head, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if head and tail given, span [h, τ].\n\nIn the input, it's always given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor right-moving car, head is greater than tail, since it's moving right, head to the right.\n\nIn (0, -11, right, 6), head=0, tail=-11, so since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if it were, head would be left, tail right, but here all seem right-moving except possibly others, but in this state, all cars are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 12) so head=-12? -12 is greater than -23? -12 > -23, so head=-12, tail=-23, right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nThe notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so [tail, head], so min to max? [τ, h] with τ < h for right-moving.\n\nIn this case, τ=-23, h=-12, so span is [-23, -12] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 + 12(T-15), -12 + 12(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: all (42, 31, right, 6)? 42 and 31, but 42>31, so head=42, tail=31? But for right-moving, head should be greater, 42>31, yes, but span should be [τ, h] = [31,42] at t1.\n\n(42,31) with head=42, tail=31, so [31,42] for right-moving.\n\nBut in the input it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", so for freeway 2: head=42, tail=31, dir=right, speed=6.\n\nSo span at t1: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [31,42]\n\nThen at T, [31 + 6(T-15), 42 + 6(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 3,4,5,6 all same: (42,31,right,6) so each has a car with span [31,42] at t1.\n\nBut freeway 2 has only one car? The table says \"Cars\" but for freeway 1,2,3,4,5,6, only one each, but for 7 and 8, multiple.\n\nFreeway 1: one car\n\nFreeway 2: one car, (42,31,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: one car, (42,31,right,6) same as 2?\n\nThat seems odd, but possible.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all same.\n\nThen freeway 7: three cars: (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same three cars.\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars cover x=0 at different turns.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFirst, let's define t1=15.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, I need to check if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on k at time T.\n\nSince the span is continuous, but positions are real, I assume, but since we care about 0, it should be fine.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car at t1: span [-23, -12] for right-moving, speed 12.\n\nAt time T, span: [ -23 + 12(T-15), -12 + 12(T-15) ]\n\nSet min = -23 + 12(T-15), max = -12 + 12(T-15)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -23 +12(T-15) <= 0 <= -12 +12(T-15)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12(T-15) <= 0 => 12(T-15) <= 23 => T-15 <= 23/12 = 1.916, so T <= 15 + 1.916 = 16.916, so T<=16 since T integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +12(T-15) => 12 <= 12(T-15) => 1 <= T-15 => T >= 16\n\nSo both: T>=16 and T<=16.916, so T=16\n\nFor T=16, min = -23 +12(1) = -23+12= -11\n\nmax = -12 +12 = 0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 is included (since max=0).\n\nAt T=16, min=-11, max=0, so 0 is the right endpoint, included, so yes, covered.\n\nAt T=15, min=-23, max=-12, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nT=17: min = -23 +12(2) = -23+24=1, max= -12+24=12, both >0, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car covers x=0 only at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (42,31,right,6), so head=42, tail=31, span at t1: [31,42] for right-moving? [τ,h] = [31,42]\n\nAt T, [31 + 6(T-15), 42 + 6(T-15)]\n\nmin = 31 +6(T-15), max=42+6(T-15)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 <= max\n\nBut min =31 +6(T-15) >=31 >0 for T>=15, so min>0, so 0 cannot be <= min since min>0, so 0 not in span for any T, since min starts at 31 at T=15 and increases.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6 all same, min=31>0, so never cover x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (42,31,right,6), same as above, min=31+6(T-15) >=31>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6), head=-36? tail=-47? head=-36, tail=-47, but -36 > -47, so for right-moving, span at t1: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nThen at T: [ -47 + 6(T-15), -36 + 6(T-15) ]\n\nmin = -47 +6(T-15), max = -36 +6(T-15)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 <= max\n\nFirst: min <=0 => -47 +6(T-15) <=0 => 6(T-15) <=47 => T-15 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, T<=22.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= max => 0 <= -36 +6(T-15) => 36 <=6(T-15) => 6 <= T-15 => T>=21\n\nSo T>=21 and T<=22.833, so T=21,22\n\nAt T=21: min = -47 +6(6) = -47+36= -11, max= -36+36=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=22: min= -47 +42= -5? 6*(22-15)=6*7=42, min=-47+42=-5, max=-36+42=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=23: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, both >0, not covered.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 +6(T-15), 0 +6(T-15) ] = [ -11 +6(T-15), 6(T-15) ]\n\nmin = -11 +6(T-15), max=6(T-15)\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 <= max\n\nFirst: min <=0 => -11 +6(T-15) <=0 => 6(T-15) <=11 => T-15 <= 11/6≈1.833, T<=16.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= max => 0 <= 6(T-15) => T-15 >=0 => T>=15\n\nSo T>=15 and T<=16.833, so T=15,16\n\nAt T=15: min=-11 +0 = -11, max=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=16: min=-11 +6(1)= -5, max=6(1)=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=17: min=-11+12=1, max=12, both >0, not covered.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at a given T, if any car covers 0.\n\nSo at T=15: third car covers 0.\n\nT=16: first car? First car never covers, second not yet, third car covers at T=16? Third car covers at T=15 and 16.\n\nAt T=15: min=-11, max=0, includes 0.\n\nT=16: min=-5, max=6, includes 0.\n\nAlso at T=21 and 22, second car covers.\n\nBut for now, since we start from t1=15, and we care about future turns.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same as freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same three cars: (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) so identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo freeway 8 also has cars covering 0 at same times.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, when x=0 is covered (i.e., unsafe to be on that freeway at that turn).\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=16\n\nFreeway 2: never unsafe, since min>0 always\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, never\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=15 (from third car), T=16 (third car), T=21 (second car), T=22 (second car)\n\nAt T=15, third car covers 0.\n\nT=16, third car covers 0 (since min=-5<0, max=6>0)\n\nAnd also T=21 and 22 from second car.\n\nBut T=17 to 20, no car covers 0 on freeway 7? First car never, second car only at 21,22, third only at 15,16. So at T=17,18,19,20, all min>0 or not covering, min of third car at T=17 is 1>0, etc., so safe at T=17,18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=17, min for third car is -11+6(2)= -11+12=1>0, max=12>0, not cover. Second car min at T=17: -47+6(2)= -47+12= -35<0, but max= -36+12= -24<0, both <0, so 0 not in. First car min=31+12=43>0. So yes, safe T=17 to 20.\n\nSimilarly T=18,19,20.\n\nT=21: second car min=-47+6(6)= -47+36= -11<0, max=-36+36=0, so covers 0. Safe? Unsafe.\n\nT=22: min=-47+42= -5<0, max=-36+42=6>0, covers.\n\nNow, also freeway 1 only at T=16.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn t1=15.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and freeways have cars only for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, at turn T, I am on some y_T, and I need to not be on a freeway where x=0 is covered at that exact turn.\n\nThe action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=0 at turn t1=15.\n\nSet t=0 corresponding to turn t1=15.\n\nSo at time t=0 (turn 15), position y=6.\n\nAction a_t at time t, so a_t for t=0,1,2,... where t is offset from t1.\n\nSo y_{t} at time t, with t=0: y=6.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nCollision at time t if on freeway y_t, and for that freeway, at time t, x=0 covered.\n\nTime t here is the turn number, with t=0 being turn 15.\n\nIn terms of the span, we have T = t1 + t, but since t1=15, T=15+t.\n\nFor the car positions, at time t (turn 15+t), the car spans are as computed with T-t1 = t.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at time t if for that k, at turn 15+t, x=0 covered.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe only at t such that T=15+t=16, so t=1.\n\nT=16, so t=1 (since t=0 is T=15)\n\nt=0: T=15\n\nt=1: T=16\n\netc.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at t=1 (T=16)\n\nFreeway 2 to 6: never unsafe\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at t=0 (T=15), t=1 (T=16), t=6 (T=21), t=7 (T=22)\n\nBecause T=15: t=0, T=16: t=1, T=21: t=6, T=22: t=7\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, unsafe at t=0,1,6,7\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer at t=0: y=6\n\nFreeway y=6: is it unsafe? Freeway 6 has cars? From above, freeway 6 has one car (42,31,right,6), which min>0 always, so never unsafe. Similarly y=5,4,3,2 all never unsafe.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is safe always.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, safe always.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at certain times.\n\nI need to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince I need to go up to y=9, and y=6 is safe, I can stay or move.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 is current turn, I am at y=6.\n\nAt time t, I am on y_t.\n\nFor collision at time t, I need to be on freeway k=y_t, and it must be unsafe at that t.\n\nAt t=0, I am on y=6, which is safe (no car covers x=0), so no collision.\n\nNow, I take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at each step.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=6 to y=9 is 3 steps up, but I might need to wait if paths are blocked.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0: current time, but I am not on y=7 yet.\n\nI am at t=0 on y=6.\n\nIf I move up at t=0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy = 6 +1 =7, so at time t=1, I am on y=7.\n\nAt time t=1, y=7 is unsafe because T=16, freeway 7 has car covering 0.\n\nIf I move up at t=0, at t=1 I am on y=7, which is unsafe at t=1, so collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=0, a_0=S, then y_1=6, same as before.\n\nThen at t=1, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1, but safe from t=2 to t=5, then unsafe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nt=0: unsafe, t=1: unsafe, t=2: safe (as earlier), t=3,4,5 safe, t=6 unsafe, t=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at same times: t=0,1,6,7.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since I need to increase y by 3, from 6 to 9, minimum 3 turns if I go up each time, but y=7 unsafe at t=1 if I go up early.\n\nLet me list possible sequences.\n\nStart t=0, y=6.\n\nOption 1: go up at t=0: then y1=7 at t=1, but y=7 unsafe at t=1, collision, not good.\n\nOption 2: stay at t=0: a0=S, y1=6 at t=1.\n\nNow at t=1, y=6, safe.\n\nI can go up: a1=U, then y2=7 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=7, is it safe? Freeway 7 at t=2, which is T=17.\n\nAt T=17, freeway 7: as earlier, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nThen at t=2, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go up again: a2=U, y3=8 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=8, freeway 8 at T=18.\n\nT=18: freeway 8, similar to 7, at t=2 (T=17) safe, t=3 (T=18) should be safe.\n\nT=18: t=3 since T=15+t, t=3 T=18.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=18: min and max for cars.\n\nFirst car: min=31+6(18-15)=31+18=49>0\n\nSecond car: min=-47+6(3)= -47+18= -29<0, max=-36+18= -18<0, both <0? max=-18<0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: min=-11+6(3)= -11+18=7>0, max=18>0.\n\nSo no car covers 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nSo at t=3, y=8 safe.\n\nThen go up to y=9: a3=U, y4=9 at t=4.\n\nt=4: on y=9, which is safe always.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at t=4.\n\nH = number of turns? The sequence is from t=0 to t=3, actions at t=0,1,2,3.\n\nt=0: action, t=1: action, t=2: action, t=3: action, then at t=4 position is y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H=4, since we start at t=0, after H actions, at time H, y_H =9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", so after H actions, from t=0 to H-1, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0,y_t1).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to turn t1+1, position based on action.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, we are at turn t1 + k.\n\nAnd we want at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is until we reach (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=0 to t=3 (4 actions), at turn t1+4 =15+4=19, position y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nH=4.\n\nCan I do in H=3?\n\nTo go from y=6 to y=9 in 3 steps, I need to increase by 3, so must go up each time, no down or stay.\n\nSo actions: U,U,U.\n\na0=U: then y1=7 at t=1.\n\nBut at t=1, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I start with S, but then y1=6, then a1=U, y2=7 at t=2, then a2=U, y3=8 at t=3, then I need another action to go to y=9? With three actions: actions at t=0,1,2.\n\nAfter a2, position at t=3.\n\nIf I do U at t=0, U at t=1, U at t=2, then positions:\n\nt=0: y=6\n\na0=U: y1=7 at t=1\n\nt=1: on y=7, unsafe if at that turn.\n\nAt t=1, T=16, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I do S at t=0, then U at t=1, U at t=2.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: y=6, action S: y1=6 at t=1\n\nt=1: on y=6, action U: y2=7 at t=2\n\nt=2: on y=7, action U: y3=8 at t=3\n\nThen at t=3, y=8, but I need to be at y=9, so not yet.\n\nWith two actions, I am at y=8 at t=3, not y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith actions: after k actions, at turn t1+k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nWith k actions from t=0 to k-1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y=6.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn t1+2, y could be 4 to 8, etc.\n\nTo be at y=9, it must be after some action sequence.\n\nThe minimal number of actions to increase y by 3 is 3, with U,U,U.\n\nBut with U,U,U starting from t=0:\n\n- At turn t1+0=15, position (0,6), take a_{t1} = U\n\n- Then at turn t1+1=16, position (0,7)\n\nBut at turn 16, on y=7, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I delay, but with three actions, I can only reach up to y=8 if I go up twice, or y=9 if up three times.\n\nBut up three times causes collision at first move up.\n\nIf I go up, up, but not immediately.\n\nFor example, a0=S: at t1+1=16, position (0,6)\n\nThen a1=U: at t1+2=17, position (0,7)\n\nAt turn 17, y=7, is it safe? T=17, freeway 7 safe, as before.\n\nThen a2=U: at t1+3=18, position (0,8)\n\nAt turn 18, y=8, safe.\n\nBut I am at (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nI need another action to go to (0,9): a3=U, at t1+4=19, position (0,9)\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go up at t=0, but to y=7 at t=1, unsafe, so not possible.\n\nGo down? But going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nFor example, go down to y=5 or something, but y=5 is freeway 5, which is safe always, but then I need to go up more steps, which might take more turns.\n\nFor instance, a0=D: from y=6 to y=5 at t=1.\n\nt=1: on y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up multiple times.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go from 5 to 9, which is 4 steps, so at least 4 actions, same as before or worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, same as before.\n\nSo H=4 seems minimal.\n\nBut earlier with S,U,U,U: actions at t=0,1,2,3: S, U, U, U\n\nPositions:\n\nTurn t1: position (0,6), action S? Action at turn t.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t1=15: position (0,6), take action a_{t1} = S (for example)\n\nThen at turn 16: position (0,6), since S, y same.\n\nNow at turn 16: take action a_{t1+1} = U\n\nThen at turn 17: position (0,7)\n\nAt turn 17: take action a_{t1+2} = U\n\nThen at turn 18: position (0,8)\n\nAt turn 18: take action a_{t1+3} = U\n\nThen at turn 19: position (0,9)\n\nReached at turn 19.\n\nBut at turn 17: position (0,7), is it safe? Turn 17, T=17, freeway y=7, as before, no car covers 0, safe.\n\nTurn 18: (0,8), freeway 8, T=18, similarly safe.\n\nNow, but y=7 is unsafe at t=6 and t=7, which are turns T=21 and 22, but we are at turn 17 and 18, which are t=2 and t=3 (since t=0 T=15, t=1 T=16, t=2 T=17, t=3 T=18), so t=2 and 3 are safe.\n\nt=6 would be T=21, unsafe.\n\nBut we are not there.\n\nIn this sequence, I used S at first, but I could do nothing at first, but same.\n\nCan I go directly without staying?\n\nFor example, at turn 15, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nI could go up, but if I go up, to y=7 at turn 16, but turn 16 y=7 unsafe.\n\nUnless I go at a different time.\n\nBut y=7 is only unsafe at turn 15,16,21,22.\n\nTurn 15 and 16 are t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt turn 15, I am on y=6, not y=7.\n\nIf I want to be on y=7, I need to be there at a safe turn, like turn 17,18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=7: I can go at turn 17, for example.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 17.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nAt turn 15: y=6, I can take action.\n\nIf I take U at turn 15, I go to y=7 at turn 16, but turn 16 unsafe.\n\nIf I take S at turn 15, I stay at y=6 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, I take U, go to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nWhich is safe.\n\nSimilarly, to go to y=8: at turn 17 I am on y=7, take U, go to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen to y=9: at turn 18, take U, to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 18.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nThen I need to have arrived at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 17, I must have been on y=8 or y=9, and taken action.\n\nIf at turn 17 I am on y=8, take U, to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, position y=8.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 16, I must have been on y=7,8, or9 and taken action to be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nIf at turn 16 I am on y=7, take U, to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nIf on y=8, take S, to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nBut y=8 at turn 16: is it safe? Turn 16, T=16, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at turn 16 unsafe.\n\nTo be on y=8 at turn 17, I need to come from turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, if I am on y=7, and take U, to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at turn 16, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I am on y=8 at turn 16, take S, to y=8 at turn 17, but turn 16 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I am on y=9 at turn 16, take D, to y=8 at turn 17, but y=9 safe, but going down not efficient.\n\nBut to be at y=9 earlier is better, but we want to reach y=9, not go down.\n\nPerhaps from below.\n\nAt turn 15: y=6.\n\nIf I take U at turn 15, to y=7 at turn 16, unsafe, impossible.\n\nTake S at turn 15, to y=6 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, take U, to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, take U, to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 17, I need at turn 16 to be on y=7 or y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 unsafe, y=8 at turn 16 unsafe, y=9 at turn 16: but how to be at y=9 at turn 16? Even faster, from y=6 to y=9 in one step? No, impossible, since moves are ±1 or 0.\n\nAt turn 16, y=9 only if from turn 15, on y=8 or9 and action.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=6, not y=8.\n\nSo cannot be at y=9 before turn 18? Turn 15: y=6, after one action at turn 16: y=5,6,7; after two actions at turn 17: y=4 to 8; after three actions at turn 18: y=3 to 9.\n\nSo earliest possible to reach y=9 is turn 18, with three up actions.\n\nBut to reach at turn 18, I need y=9 at turn 18.\n\nWhich requires that at turn 17, I am on y=8 or y=9, and take action to be at y=9 at turn 18.\n\nIf at turn 17 on y=8, take U, to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nIf on y=9, take S or D, but S stays, D down, not to y=9.\n\nSo best is on y=8 at turn 17, take U to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nNow, need to be on y=8 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, position y=8.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nAt turn 16, must be on y=7,8,9 and take action to be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nOptions:\n\n- On y=7 at turn 16, take U to y=8 at turn 17\n\n- On y=8 at turn 16, take S to y=8 at turn 17\n\n- On y=9 at turn 16, take D to y=8 at turn 17\n\nBut at turn 16, y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe (T=16), so if I am on them, collision.\n\ny=9 is safe, but if I am on y=9 at turn 16, I don't need to go to y=8.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at turn 16, I need to have arrived earlier, impossible from y=6.\n\nSo, at turn 16, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 without collision, and y=9 not possible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at turn 17, because I cannot be at a position at turn 16 that allows it without collision or inefficiency.\n\nSpecifically, the only way to be at y=8 at turn 17 is from y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at turn 16.\n\ny=7 and y=8 at turn 16 are unsafe, so if I try to be there, collision.\n\ny=9 at turn 16 not possible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=9 at turn 18.\n\nTherefore, the earliest possible is turn 19, with y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAs in the sequence I had.\n\nWith H=4 actions.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nThen position at turn t1+4=19.\n\nNow, in the sequence I proposed: S, U, U, U\n\nBut S at first turn.\n\nI could do other things, but not faster.\n\nPerhaps go up later.\n\nBut H=4 seems minimal.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1=15: action S\n\nThen turn t1+1=16: action U\n\nThen turn t1+2=17: action U\n\nThen turn t1+3=18: action U\n\nThen at turn 19, position (0,9)\n\nBut at turn 18, after action U, position is (0,9)? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at turn 18, position at turn 19.\n\nIn terms of the state:\n\nAt turn 15: position (0,6), take action a_{15}\n\nThen at turn 16: position based on a_{15}, etc.\n\nAfter taking action a_t at turn t, the position updates to the new position at turn t+1.\n\nSo to have position at turn T be (0,9), we take actions up to turn T-1.\n\nFor example, to be at (0,9) at turn 19, actions from turn 15 to 18.\n\na_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\n\nWith the sequence above: a_{15}=S, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U\n\nThen:\n\n- After a_{15}=S, at turn 16: position (0,6)\n\n- After a_{16}=U, at turn 17: position (0,7)\n\n- After a_{17}=U, at turn 18: position (0,8)\n\n- After a_{18}=U, at turn 19: position (0,9)\n\nAnd all positions are safe: turn 16: y=6 safe, turn 17: y=7 safe (T=17), turn 18: y=8 safe (T=18)\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=3? That would reach at turn 18.\n\nActions a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, then position at turn 18.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 17, position must be y=8 or y=9, and take action to y=9 at turn 18.\n\nIf at turn 17 position y=8, take U.\n\nIf y=9, take S or D, but S stays, so to reach y=9, better to be at y=8 and take U.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17 position y=8.\n\nThen at turn 16, position must be y=7,8,9 and action to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 16, if position y=7, take U to y=8 at turn 17.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 16 unsafe.\n\nIf position y=8 at turn 16, take S to y=8 at turn 17, but y=8 at turn 16 unsafe.\n\nIf position y=9 at turn 16, take D to y=8 at turn 17, but y=9 at turn 16 not possible, and going down not helpful.\n\nSo cannot be at y=8 at turn 17 without having been on unsafe freeway or not possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4.\n\nIn the sequence, I have S at first, but I could have other actions, but S is fine.\n\nTo make it faster, but not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at turn 15 to y=7 at turn 16, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr, at turn 15, I could go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=5, then up to y=9, but from y=5 to y=9, 4 steps, so at least 4 actions, same or worse.\n\nFor instance, a15=D to y=5 at turn 16, then a16=U to y=6 at turn 17, a17=U to y=7 at turn 18, a18=U to y=8 at turn 19, then need another to y=9, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with S,U,U,U is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nThe answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nIn this case, t1=15.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, (0,9)\n\nBut the sequence has three U actions, but with S first.\n\nI need to specify the actions until the position is reached, but the actions are for the turns before reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, after these actions, we reach at turn 19.\n\nPerhaps I can reach without the first stay.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, I am on y=6, I could take U, but then to y=7 at turn 16, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake D? Not helpful.\n\nSo must stay or go down, but stay is better.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is safe at turn 17, I can go directly to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 17, from turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, I need to be on y=6 or y=7 or y=8 and take action to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nIf on y=6, take U to y=7.\n\nIf on y=7, take S or D, but D down not good.\n\nBut at turn 16, if on y=6, which is safe, take U to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7, unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo, from above: at turn 15, take S, to y=6 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, take U, to y=7 at turn 17.\n\nThen at turn 17, take U, to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, take U, to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt turn 15, take no action? But I have to take action each turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 earlier, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 15, I am on y=6, I take U, but to y=7 at turn 16, unsafe, so I cannot take that action because it leads to collision.\n\nIn the game, if I take an action that causes collision, I die, so I cannot do that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to stay at turn 15, then go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go to other freeways, but y=5,4,etc. are safe, but farther, so slower to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, go to y=5, then to y=6, etc., but more steps.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H=4 with the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, I have four actions, but the position is reached after the fourth action.\n\nIn the boxed answer, I need to write the actions for turns 15,16,17,18.\n\nt1=15, so turns 15,16,17,18.\n\nActions: S, U, U, U\n\nBut let me confirm the safety.\n\nTurn 15: position (0,6), action S. Since I take action at turn 15, but collision is checked at the beginning of the turn? I think.\n\nThe collision is at turn T, based on position at that turn.\n\nIn the dynamics: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action a_t at turn t, it determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, then I take action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15: y=6, freeway 6, no car covers 0, safe. Action S: y_{16} =6\n\nAt turn 16: y=6, freeway 6, safe. Action U: y_{17}=7\n\nAt turn 17: y=7, freeway 7, at T=17, no car covers 0, safe. Action U: y_{18}=8\n\nAt turn 18: y=8, freeway 8, at T=18, no car covers 0, safe. Action U: y_{19}=9\n\nAt turn 19: y=9, no freeway, safe, reached.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, we have cars that cover at T=21,22, but we are not there.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 at T=16, but we are not on it.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4.\n\nBut in the sequence, H=4 actions.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\n\"turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nRead: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo H is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach the position.\n\nIn this case H=4.\n\nTo be precise, from turn t1 to t1+H-1 actions, position at turn t1+H.\n\nReached at turn 19.\n\nNow, in the output, I think I need to list the actions for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for t1=15, H=4, turns 15,16,17,18.\n\nActions: S, U, U, U\n\nBut perhaps I can have a different sequence.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, instead of S, I could do nothing, but S is stay.\n\nOr, I could go down, but worse.\n\nSuppose I go up at turn 17 directly, but I need to get to y=7 first.\n\nAnother sequence: at turn 15, take U? But cannot, unsafe next.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo only way is to stay at 15.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at turn 17 by going from y=8, but not possible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nIn the answer, I need to box it.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=3, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 18 if I go to y=9 directly, but not possible.\n\nOr, use the fact that y=8 is safe at some times.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 17, not possible without being on unsafe at turn 16.\n\nUnless I am on y=8 at turn 17 from y=7 at turn 16, but y=7 at turn 16 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the output format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=0 and t=1 unsafe, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=7 at turn 17, which is t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut at turn 18, action U, to go to y=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write properly.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn 15 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (turn 15):** (0, 6)\n- **Target Position:** (0, 9)\n- **Freeway Safety:**\n  - Freeway 1 (y=1): Unsafe only at turn 16 (t=1 relative to turn 15).\n  - Freeways 2-6 (y=2 to y=6): Always safe, as no car covers x=0 at any turn.\n  - Freeway 7 (y=7): Unsafe at turns 15, 16, 21, and 22.\n  - Freeway 8 (y=8): Unsafe at turns 15, 16, 21, and 22.\n  - y=0 and y=9 are always safe (no cars).\n\nTo minimize turns, the player should move up as quickly as possible without colliding. The minimal path requires increasing y from 6 to 9, which takes at least 3 upward moves. However, moving up immediately at turn 15 leads to y=7 at turn 16, which is unsafe. Therefore, a slight delay is necessary.\n\n### Optimal Sequence:\n- At turn 15, stay (S) to remain at y=6 (safe).\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to y=7 at turn 17. Turn 17 is safe for y=7.\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to y=8 at turn 18. Turn 18 is safe for y=8.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to y=9 at turn 19. y=9 is always safe.\n\nThis sequence takes 4 actions (H=4) to reach (0, 9) at turn 19. It is minimal because:\n- Reaching y=9 in 3 actions (by turn 18) would require being at y=8 at turn 17, which in turn requires being on y=7 or y=8 at turn 16—both unsafe at turn 16.\n- Any sequence with down (D) or additional stay (S) actions would take more than 4 turns to reach y=9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 15: Stay (S) to avoid moving to y=7 at turn 16 (unsafe).\n- Turn 16: Move up (U) to reach y=7 at turn 17 (safe, as freeway 7 is safe at turn 17).\n- Turn 17: Move up (U) to reach y=8 at turn 18 (safe, as freeway 8 is safe at turn 18).\n- Turn 18: Move up (U) to reach y=9 at turn 19 (safe).\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns H is 4, with the sequence of actions as above.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=16, and the player is at y=6.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So from y=6, to reach y=9, I need to move up at least 3 times, but I might need to move down or stay to avoid cars, which could increase the number of turns.\n\nNow, about the cars: each freeway has cars moving left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. The span is the position of the car at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, they are still on y, not on y+1 or y-1 until the next turn. So when you move, you're on the current row during that turn, and you only check for cars on that row at that turn. When you decide to move to a different row, you arrive there at the next turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and you only care about cars on row y_T at turn T. If you move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you care about cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway. There are freeways from y=1 to y=8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed s=12)\n\nSince direction is right, and head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so span is [tail, head] I think? From the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h], so here [ -11, 0 ]? But it says head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: car with h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12.\n\nSo at time t, span = [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] = [-11 + 12(t - t1), 0 + 12(t - t1)]\n\nSince t1=16, at any turn T, span = [-11 + 12(T - 16), 12(T - 16)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nSo head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nFrom the update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn freeway 2, it says (48, 37, right, 6), so I think it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so head=48, tail=37, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nThen at time T, span = [37 + 6(T-16), 48 + 6(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5,6: all have the same: (48,37,right,6) so one car each.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to know when 0 is in its span, because collision happens if at turn T, on that freeway, 0 is in the span for any car.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each turn, we only care about the row they are on at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at t=16.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. The player is at (0,y), so x=0 is the position we care about for collision.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, from y=6, to y=9, minimum moves are 3 up, but we have to avoid being on y=1 to 8 when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, at which turns there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for each row, find the set of T where for some car on that row, 0 ∈ span at T.\n\nThen, when the player is on that row at turn T, it must not be such a T.\n\nSince the player moves one row per turn max, we need to plan the path through the rows over time.\n\nLet me denote the time relative to t1=16. Set τ = T - 16, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, player at y=6.\n\nWe need to find actions for τ=0 to H-1, so turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nτ from 0 to H-1, at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when x=0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12) at t1=16.\n\nSpan at time T: [ -11 + 12(T-16), 12(T-16) ]\n\nSet x=0 in span: lower <= 0 <= upper\n\nLower bound: -11 + 12(τ) where τ = T-16\n\nUpper bound: 12(τ)\n\nSo -11 + 12τ <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nFirst inequality: -11 + 12τ <= 0 => 12τ <= 11 => τ <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 12τ => τ >= 0\n\nBut τ integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ = T - 16, integer.\n\nSo τ >= 0 and τ <= 11/12? 11/12 <1, so τ <= 0 since τ integer >=0.\n\nτ >=0 and τ <= 11/12, but 11/12 <1, so only τ=0 possible? τ=0: lower = -11 +0 = -11, upper=0, so -11 <= 0 <= 0, which is true, since 0 <= 0.\n\nAt τ=0, span is [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=1, span is [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo for freeway 1, x=0 covered only at τ=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCar: (48,37,right,6) so head=48, tail=37, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 6(τ), 48 + 6(τ)] where τ=T-16\n\nSet 0 in [37+6τ, 48+6τ]\n\n37+6τ <= 0 <= 48+6τ\n\nFirst: 37+6τ <=0 => 6τ <= -37 => τ <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, impossible since τ>=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 48+6τ, always true for τ>=0\n\nBut 37+6τ <=0 requires τ <= -37/6 <0, not possible, so no τ where 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (48,37,right,6), same as above, no coverage at x=0 for τ>=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nMultiple cars: first car (48,37,right,6), same as above, no coverage.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6) head=-30, tail=-41? Direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for right-moving.\n\nThen at T: [ -41 + 6(τ), -30 + 6(τ) ] where τ=T-16\n\nSet 0 in [ -41+6τ, -30+6τ ]\n\nSo -41+6τ <= 0 <= -30+6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -41+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=41 => τ <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30+6τ => 30 <=6τ => τ >= 30/6 =5\n\nSo for τ integer, τ >=5 and τ <=6.833, so τ=5,6\n\nAt τ=5: lower= -41 + 6*5 = -41+30= -11, upper= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nτ=6: lower= -41+36= -5, upper= -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nτ=7: lower= -41+42=1, upper= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nThird car on freeway 7: (6,-5,right,6) head=6, tail=-5? Direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-5, 6]\n\nAt T: [ -5 + 6τ, 6 + 6τ ]\n\nSet 0 in [ -5+6τ, 6+6τ ]\n\n-5+6τ <=0 <=6+6τ\n\nFirst: -5+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=5 => τ <=5/6≈0.833\n\nSecond: 0 <=6+6τ, always true for τ>=0\n\nSo τ <=0.833 and τ>=0, integer τ=0\n\nAt τ=0: lower=-5, upper=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow for freeway 7, we have three cars:\n\n- First car: no coverage\n\n- Second car: coverage at τ=5 and τ=6\n\n- Third car: coverage at τ=0\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, x=0 covered when τ=0 or τ=5 or τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: y=8\n\nSame cars as freeway 7: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSame as above, so coverage at τ=0,5,6 for the same reasons.\n\nNow freeway 6: we have only one car (48,37,right,6), which we said no coverage, so freeway 6 is always safe at x=0 for τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,4,3,2 all same, no coverage.\n\nFreeway 1: coverage only at τ=0.\n\nNow player starts at y=6 at τ=0.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which has no coverage at all, so at τ=0, on y=6, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous rows are y=1,7,8 at certain times.\n\ny=1: dangerous only at τ=0\n\ny=7: dangerous at τ=0,5,6\n\ny=8: dangerous at τ=0,5,6\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=5,4,3,2: always safe\n\ny=1: dangerous only at τ=0, but since player starts at y=6, and τ=0 is now, we are not on y=1.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to move up from y=6.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nSince we want to minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible, but avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nAlso at τ=0, but τ=0 is current time, we are on y=6.\n\nNow, let me denote the player's position over time.\n\nLet y(τ) be the row at time τ, relative to t1.\n\nAt τ=0, y(0) = 6\n\nAt each step, y(τ+1) = y(τ) + a(τ), where a(τ) is U, D, S, so Δy = +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nWe need y(τ) for τ from 0 to H-1, and y(H-1) =9.\n\nCollision if at time τ, y(τ) is between 1 and 8, and for that row, at τ, x=0 is covered.\n\nFor row y, at time τ, if it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If y(τ) =1, dangerous only if τ=0\n\n- If y(τ) =7, dangerous if τ=0,5,6\n\n- If y(τ) =8, dangerous if τ=0,5,6\n\n- Other rows: y=2,3,4,5,6: always safe, since no coverage.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=5,4,3,2 all safe.\n\ny=1 dangerous only at τ=0.\n\nBut τ=0 is past? No, τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=6, not on y=1.\n\nFor future, if player goes to y=1, it would be at some τ>0, and at τ>0, y=1 is safe, since only dangerous at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 dangerous at τ=0,5,6.\n\nτ=0 is now, we are not on them.\n\nSo for τ>0, y=7 and y=8 dangerous only at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nNow, the goal is y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=6, if we go up every turn, we can be at y=9 at τ=3: after three U moves.\n\nAt τ=0: y=6\n\nAfter action at τ=0: if U, at τ=1, y=7\n\nIf U at τ=1, at τ=2, y=8\n\nIf U at τ=2, at τ=3, y=9\n\nSo at τ=3, y=9, which is goal.\n\nBut we need to check if during the path, we are safe.\n\nAt τ=0: on y=6, safe.\n\nAt τ=1: if we go to y=7, we are on y=7 at time τ=1.\n\nNow, is y=7 safe at τ=1? From above, y=7 dangerous at τ=0,5,6. τ=1 is not 0,5,6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2: if on y=8, dangerous at τ=0,5,6, τ=2 not among them, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=3: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with three U moves, we can reach in three turns, and all positions safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nτ is time index, at time τ, we are on row y(τ).\n\nAction at time τ determines y(τ+1).\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t1 + t, for t from 0 to H-1, action a_{t1+t} is taken, and after H-1 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nSet t as the step, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt the start of turn t1, before action, player at (0,6).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, player moves to new position for the next turn.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen, based on action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that row with 0 in span at T.\n\nIn this case, T = t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, but at turn T, we are at y_T before action, I think.\n\nThe collision is at turn T when we are on the row.\n\nFor turn T, we are on row y_T, and we take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ (relative), row y(τ).\n\nFor τ=0, T=t1=16, y=6.\n\nAction a_{t1} at turn t1, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, including t1.\n\nIn this case, at τ=0, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, suppose we take U at τ=0: then at τ=1 (T=17), y=7.\n\nAt τ=1, on y=7.\n\nNow, is it safe? y=7 dangerous at τ=0,5,6. τ=1 not, so safe.\n\nThen take U at τ=1: at τ=2 (T=18), y=8.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=8, dangerous at τ=0,5,6, not τ=2, safe.\n\nThen take U at τ=2: at τ=3 (T=19), y=9.\n\nAt τ=3, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with actions: at turn t1: U, turn t1+1: U, turn t1+2: U, and at turn t1+3, we are at y=9, but we don't need an action at turn t1+3 if we reach at turn t1+3.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, we have moved k times.\n\nAt turn t1, we start at y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y for turn t1+1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t1 + (H-1), and y_{t1 + H-1} should be 9.\n\nIn the path above: after 0 actions, at turn t1, y=6.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t1), at turn t1+1, y=7.\n\nAfter 2 actions (at t1 and t1+1), at turn t1+2, y=8.\n\nAfter 3 actions (at t1, t1+1, t1+2), at turn t1+3, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t1+3, y=9, so we reached at turn t1+3, which means after 3 actions, H-1=3? No.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nSet: actions at time indices: actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the player is at y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position for T+1 is set.\n\nSo at turn t1 + t, for t from 0 to H-1, we take action a_{t1 + t}.\n\nThen, after taking action at turn t1 + H-1, the position at turn t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H-1, and at turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nFor the collision, at each turn from t1 to t1 + H-1, when we are on the row before action, we need to not collide.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe, no issue.\n\nIn the minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible, so minimize H such that at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the path above: with three actions: at t1: U, go to y=7 at t1+1\n\nAt t1+1: U, go to y=8 at t1+2\n\nAt t1+2: U, go to y=9 at t1+3\n\nSo at turn t1+3, y=9, so we reached at turn t1+3, meaning H=3, since we took actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, so t from 0 to 2, H-1=2? H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nNumber of actions is H.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t1, position y=6.\n\nAfter action at t1, position at t1+1.\n\nAfter action at t1+1, position at t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t1 + (H-1), position at t1 + H.\n\nWe want position at t1 + H to be 9.\n\nSo we take H actions: at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, to reach at t1+3, we need H such that t1 + H = t1+3, so H=3.\n\nActions at t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nAt turn t1: on y=6, take action.\n\nAt turn t1+1: on y=7 (after first U), take action.\n\nAt turn t1+2: on y=8, take action.\n\nAt turn t1+3: on y=9.\n\nCollision checked at each turn when we are on the row: at turn t1, on y=6, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+1, on y=7, which is at time τ=1 (since τ=T-t1, T=t1+1, τ=1), and y=7 at τ=1, which is safe as above.\n\nAt turn t1+2, on y=8, τ=2, safe.\n\nAt turn t1+3, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems fine with H=3.\n\nBut is there a problem at τ=0 for other rows? No, we are not on them.\n\nThe player is only on one row per turn.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 and 8 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nIn this path, we are not on y=7 or 8 at τ=5 or 6, since we reach y=9 at τ=3, which is before τ=5.\n\nτ=3 <5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, only dangerous at τ=0, not an issue.\n\nSo with three up moves, we can reach in three turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car at τ=0, but we are not on y=7 or 8 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=6.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nFreeway 6 has no cars at x=0, as we said.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car (48,37,right,6), span at T: [37 +6τ, 48+6τ] for τ>=0, min 37>0, so 0 never in span, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the direct path seems fine.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars on 7 and 8? But in this path, we don't encounter the danger times.\n\nPerhaps at τ=0, for freeway 7 and 8, but we are not on them.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible.\n\nBut let me see if we can do in fewer? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 steps, since each move changes y by at most 1, so at least 3 actions needed. So H=3 is minimal.\n\nWith H=3, it works.\n\nActions: at turn t1=16: U\n\nThen at turn 17: U\n\nThen at turn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=3, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision definition.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for example, when you move from y=6 to y=7 at turn T, at turn T you are on y=6, so you only check cars on y=6 at that turn, not on y=7.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 16 (τ=0), on y=6, action U, so moving to y=7, but at turn 16, we are on y=6, so we check cars on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 17 (τ=1), we are now on y=7, so we check cars on y=7 at τ=1. As above, y=7 at τ=1 is safe, since dangerous only at τ=0,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, action U, moving to y=8, but at turn 17, we are on y=7.\n\nThen at turn 18 (τ=2), on y=8, check y=8 at τ=2, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 19, on y=9, no check needed or safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, at τ=0, it is dangerous, but we are not on it at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car that covers at τ=0, but since player is not on that row, no issue.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that forces us to wait.\n\nFor example, if we were to go to y=7 later, but at τ=5 or 6, it is dangerous, but in this case, we go early, before τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, we could go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=3 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, at τ=0, dangerous, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Hazardous only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (relative time, where \\(\\tau = T - 16\\)), as a car covers \\(x=0\\) at this time. Since the player is at \\(y=6\\) at \\(\\tau=0\\), this is not a concern.\n- **Freeways 2-6 (y=2 to y=6)**: No car covers \\(x=0\\) at any \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\), so these rows are always safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Hazardous at \\(\\tau = 0, 5, 6\\) due to cars covering \\(x=0\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Hazardous at \\(\\tau = 0, 5, 6\\) due to cars covering \\(x=0\\).\n\nThe player must avoid being on \\(y=7\\) or \\(y=8\\) at \\(\\tau=5\\) or \\(\\tau=6\\), but can safely occupy these rows at other times. Rows \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=9\\) are always safe, as they have no freeways.\n\n### Path to Goal\nThe minimal path requires moving up three times:\n- At turn 16 (\\(\\tau=0\\)): Player is at \\(y=6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 has no hazard). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=7\\) for turn 17.\n- At turn 17 (\\(\\tau=1\\)): Player is at \\(y=7\\). Since \\(\\tau=1\\) is not hazardous for \\(y=7\\) (hazardous only at \\(\\tau=0,5,6\\)), it is safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=8\\) for turn 18.\n- At turn 18 (\\(\\tau=2\\)): Player is at \\(y=8\\). Since \\(\\tau=2\\) is not hazardous for \\(y=8\\) (hazardous only at \\(\\tau=0,5,6\\)), it is safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=9\\) for turn 19.\n- At turn 19 (\\(\\tau=3\\)): Player is at \\(y=9\\), the goal.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H=3\\) turns (actions at turns 16, 17, and 18). Since the player moves directly upward without detours and avoids all hazardous times, \\(H=3\\) is minimal (as at least 3 up moves are required to increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 17: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\)\n\nAfter the third action (at turn 18), the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 19.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 16: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 7) on turn t₁ = 17. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, so we need to move up from y=7 to y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay within [0,9]. Since we're going up to y=9, and starting from y=7, we need at least 2 moves up to reach y=9. But we have to avoid cars, so it might take more turns if we have to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, about the cars: each freeway has cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. The collision happens only if at the turn when the player is on a freeway, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, and you only check for collision on y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t₁=17.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12)\n\nSince direction is right, and head=12, tail=1, that means the car is moving right, so the head is at the front, which is larger x. For right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head] with tail < head. In the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, head should be larger than tail, I think.\n\nLooking at freeway 1: head=12, tail=1, direction=right. So head=12 > tail=1, so it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head would be smaller, but here all seem right-moving except possibly some.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=12\n\nFreeway 2: one car: h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? \" (54,43,right,6) \" so one car.\n\nThe table says:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars ... |\n\nFor k=1: (12,1,right,12)\n\nk=2: (54,43,right,6)\n\nk=3: (54,43,right,6)  // same as k=2? Probably different cars but same parameters.\n\nk=4: (54,43,right,6)\n\nk=5: (54,43,right,6)\n\nk=6: (54,43,right,6)\n\nk=7: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nk=8: same as k=7: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nSo for freeways 1 to 6, each has one car except freeway 1 has different car. Freeway 1 has its own car.\n\nNow, since the player is at (0,7) at turn 17, and we need to go to y=9, we only care about freeways y=7 and y=8 because to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point before moving to y=9.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when y is between 1 and 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something, but the problem says freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, and collision occurs only if on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, at the start, player is at y=7, so on freeway 7 at turn t₁=17.\n\nWe need to check if there is a collision at turn 17 on freeway 7.\n\nFirst, let's define the car positions at turn T relative to t₁.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁, so at turn t₁, τ=0.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - sτ, τ - sτ]? From the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]? No.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, head h and tail τ, but if it's left-moving, head might be smaller or larger? The rule says Span(t₁) = [h, τ], but for left-moving, as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the front, so larger x, tail is smaller, so Span(t₁) = [tail, head]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front, smaller x, tail larger? Let's see the rule.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, and since right-moving, τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)], so if it moves left, h and τ both decrease, so if h < τ, then head is left, tail is right? This might be inconsistent.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (h=12, τ=1, d=right)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [1,12] at turn t₁.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [1 + 12(T-t₁), 12 + 12(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for a car like on freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,6), direction is right, so for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] since τ should be tail, h head.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, ...), so for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn this case, h=-24, τ=-35, since -24 > -35, so tail τ=-35, head h=-24, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-35 + 6(T-t₁), -24 + 6(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data. Direction is all \"right\" in the table.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8 all have right direction cars. No left-moving mentioned.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for any car, given (h, τ, d=right, s), with h > τ since right-moving, Span at t₁ is [τ, h]\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k and 0 is in Span(T) for any car on that freeway.\n\nPlayer is on y=k at turn T if y_T = k.\n\nNow, at turn t₁=17, player is at y=7, so on freeway 7.\n\nWe need to check if there is a collision at turn 17 on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars:\n\nCar A: (54,43,right,6) so τ=43, h=54, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [43 + 6(T-17), 54 + 6(T-17)]\n\nCar B: (-24,-35,right,6) τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 6(T-17), -24 + 6(T-17)]\n\nCar C: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 6(T-17), 12 + 6(T-17)]\n\nAt turn T=17, τ=0, so:\n\nCar A: [43 + 0, 54 + 0] = [43,54], 0 not in [43,54]\n\nCar B: [-35 +0, -24 +0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in [-35,-24]\n\nCar C: [1+0,12+0] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo at turn 17, on freeway 7, no car has 0 in span, so no collision. Good, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal moves would be to go up twice: U at some turn, then U again.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions when we are on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince we start at y=7 at turn 17, we can choose to move up to y=8 at turn 18, or stay, or move down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, from y=8, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, when we move to y=8, at turn 18, we will be on y=8, so we need to check freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=9 directly, but y=9 is the goal, no cars there, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut to be on y=9, we need to be at position (0,9), which is not on a freeway, I think.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when we reach y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 17, we are at y=7.\n\nOption 1: Move up immediately to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, we are on y=8.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nFreeway 8 has three cars, same as freeway 7: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nAt turn T=18, τ = T-t₁ = 18-17=1\n\nSo for each car:\n\nCar A: τ=43, h=54, s=6, Span(18) = [43 + 6(1), 54 + 6(1)] = [43+6,54+6] = [49,60]\n\n0 not in [49,60]\n\nCar B: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, Span(18) = [-35 +6(1), -24 +6(1)] = [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18]\n\n0 not in [-29,-18]\n\nCar C: τ=1, h=12, s=6, Span(18) = [1 +6(1), 12+6(1)] = [7,18]\n\n0 not in [7,18]\n\nSo at turn 18, on y=8, no collision. Then we can move up to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached the goal.\n\nTurns: start turn 17 at y=7.\n\nAction at turn 17: U to y=8 at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, at y=8, no collision.\n\nAction at turn 18: U to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, at y=9, done.\n\nH=2 turns? From turn 17 to turn 18 and turn 18 to turn 19, so two actions: a_{17} and a_{18}, reaching at turn 19.\n\nt=0 to H-1, so for H=2, t from 0 to 1, actions at t₁ and t₁+1.\n\nSet t relative to t₁.\n\nLet t be the offset, t=0,1,2,... where turn = t₁ + t\n\nAt t=0, turn t₁, position y_{t₁} =7\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + t}, position changes.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position is set.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, we should be at (0,9).\n\nIn the dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t₁, position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,7)\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + H-1}, at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn this case, with two actions: at turn t₁ (17), action U, then at turn 18, y=8.\n\nThen at turn 18, action U, then at turn 19, y=9.\n\nSo H=2, actions at t=0 and t=1 (relative to t₁).\n\nt from 0 to H-1=1.\n\nBut we need to ensure no collision during the path.\n\nAt turn 17 (t₁), we are on y=7, and we checked no collision.\n\nAt turn 18, we are on y=8, and we checked for freeway 8 at turn 18, no collision.\n\nWhen we take action at turn 18 to go to y=9, at turn 19 we are on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue when moving? The collision is only when we are on the freeway at a turn, not during the move, I think.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only check y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn 17, we are on y=7, no collision.\n\nWe take action U, so at turn 18, we are on y=8.\n\nAt turn 18, we are on y=8, so we check freeway 8 at turn 18, which we did, no collision.\n\nThen we take action U at turn 18, so at turn 19, we are on y=9, done.\n\nNo collision at turn 19 since not on freeway.\n\nBut freeway 8 at turn 18 was safe.\n\nIn freeway 8, at turn 18, cars are at [49,60], [-29,-18], [7,18], all not containing 0.\n\n[7,18] at x=7 to 18, so 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems we can go directly in two moves.\n\nBut the player starts at y=7, which is freeway 7, and we have cars on freeway 7 at turn 17, but we already checked no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, we don't need to be on freeway 7 again if we move up.\n\nBut in this plan, we move up immediately.\n\nIs there a reason to wait or something?\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but since we are going directly to y=8 then y=9, we only care about y=7 at t=17 and y=8 at t=18.\n\nBoth are safe as per above.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 at turn 17: cars at [43,54], [-35,-24], [1,12], 0 not in any.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 18: as above.\n\nBut freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7? No, different freeways.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are different, each with their own cars.\n\nIn the state, freeway 7 has three cars, freeway 8 also has three cars with same parameters, but they are on different rows, so independent.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut in freeway 8 at turn 18, car C is at [7,18], which includes x=7 to 18, so 0 not in, since 7>0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 17 on y=7, if we stay, what happens, but we don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: the player must avoid collisions, but in this path, no issue.\n\nBut let me see if going to y=8 at turn 18 is safe, which it is.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no car check.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut the problem might have obstacles, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nPerhaps on the way, but since we move directly, only two points.\n\nMaybe for y=8, if we arrive at a different time.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nt₁=17.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 18 (T=18, τ=1)\n\nCar on freeway 8: first car (54,43,right,6) so τ=43, h=54, s=6\n\nSpan at T=18: [43 + 6*1, 54 + 6*1] = [49,60]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6) τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSpan: [-35 +6, -24+6] = [-29,-18]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nSpan: [1+6,12+6] = [7,18]\n\n0 not in any, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17 on y=7: same spans as above but at τ=0, so [43,54], [-35,-24], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo why would we need more turns?\n\nPerhaps for other actions.\n\nBut the player is at y=7, we need to go to y=9.\n\nIf we go down, it would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nIf we stay, same position.\n\nSo minimal should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 17, if we go up to y=8, then at turn 18 y=8, then we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut if at turn 18, when we are on y=8, if there was a collision, we might need to wait, but here no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, if we delayed going to y=8.\n\nBut since we can go now, why wait.\n\nAnother thing: the cars are moving, so at different times, the spans change.\n\nFor instance, on freeway 8, car C at [1 + 6τ, 12 + 6τ] for τ=T-17.\n\nAt τ=0, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nτ=1, [7,18], 0 not in\n\nτ=2, [13,24], etc., always positive, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, car A: [43+6τ,54+6τ], all large positive, 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [-35+6τ, -24+6τ]\n\nWhen does this contain 0?\n\nSet -35 +6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6τ\n\nSince -35 +6τ ≤ 0 implies τ ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -24 +6τ implies 6τ ≥ 24, τ ≥ 4\n\nSo for τ between 4 and 5.833, 0 in span.\n\nτ=4,5 since τ integer.\n\nτ = T-17\n\nAt T=21, τ=4: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]\n\n-35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], which includes 0.\n\nAt T=22, τ=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nAt T=23, τ=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 8, for car B, collision at T=21 and T=22 if player is on y=8.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at y=8 only at T=18, which is τ=1, span [-29,-18], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, car B: same parameters, so at T=21 and T=22, collision on y=7.\n\nBut we are not there at that time.\n\nIn our direct path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can consider if we need to be on y=8 later, but we don't.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t₁.\n\nSo for t₁=17:\n\nTurn 17: U (to go to y=8 at turn 18)\n\nThen at turn 18: U (to go to y=9 at turn 19)\n\nThen done.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at t=0 and t=1 relative to t₁.\n\nH=2 turns? H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position is y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=2.\n\nBut the player position is given at turn t₁, before action, I think.\n\nAt turn t₁, position is given, then we take action a_{t₁}, move to y_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter a_{t₁ + H-1}, at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions: a_{17} = U, then at turn 18, y=8\n\nThen a_{18} = U, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a reason this might not work?\n\nPerhaps on freeway 7 at turn 17, but we checked no collision.\n\nMaybe I misread the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has car C: (12,1,right,6), at turn 17, τ=0, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut 1 to 12, x=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, but since it's [1,12], 0 not equal to 1 or 12, so not included, assuming continuous or integer? The grid is discrete? The position is on grid, but cars have spans, and collision if 0 in span, which includes endpoints I think.\n\nThe span is [a,b], so if a <= 0 <= b, collision.\n\nAt [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not <= b? 0 < 1, so not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, [-35,-24], -24 <0, so 0 not in.\n\nOnly if a <=0 and b>=0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, with two moves, we can reach.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=2.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach in one move? From y=7 to y=8, but we need to be at (0,9), so at least two moves: one to y=8, one to y=9. Unless we can jump, but no, only +1,0,-1 per turn.\n\nSo minimum H=2 is achievable.\n\nPerhaps there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the freeways y=1 to 8, but when we are at y=7, we are on freeway 7, and moving to y=8, at that turn we are still on y=7 when moving.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but we are only there at turn 18.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 17, if we go up, we arrive at y=8 at turn 18.\n\nIf we stay at turn 17, we remain at y=7, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr if we go down, worse.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the car state has multiple freeways, but since we only traverse y=7 and y=8 briefly, and at those times safe, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the path to y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so once we reach, no issue.\n\nSo I believe the minimal H is 2.\n\nThus, the sequence:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 17: U Turn 18: U }\n\nBut in the format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nFor H=2, two lines.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to confirm if at turn 18 on y=8 is indeed safe.\n\nCar C span [7,18] at T=18, 7>0, so 0 not <=18? 0<7, so not in [7,18].\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut 0 is less than 7, so not in the interval.\n\nUnless the span includes x=0, but here min x is 7.\n\nSimilarly, car B at [-29,-18], max is -18<0, so no.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, but at turn 17, we are leaving immediately.\n\nAnother thing: when we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn 17, at turn 17 we are on y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 18, we are on y=8, and we take action to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 18, we are on y=8, so we must not have collision at that turn.\n\nWhich we don't.\n\nThen at turn 19, we arrive at y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nPerhaps the initial position is at (0,7), and freeway 7 has cars, but safe.\n\nSo the answer should be two moves up.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 at turn 17: car C is (12,1,right,6), span [1,12], which is from x=1 to 12, so if the player is at x=0, not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 17, if we stay, what happens, but we don't need to.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with actions U at turn 17 and U at turn 18.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nHere t=0: a_{17} = U\n\nt=1: a_{18} = U\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H = 17 + 2 = 19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U }\n\nIn the text, it might be with new lines.\n\nIn the instruction: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ...\"\n\nSo probably each on new line.\n\nBut since it's in a box, we can write with line breaks.\n\nFor this case, it should be simple.\n\nBut I recall that in freeway 7 and 8, there are cars that could be at x=0 at other times, but not at the times we are there.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) on turn 17 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal number of moves required to go from y=7 to y=9 is 2, as each \"U\" action increases y by 1.\n- At turn 17, the player is on freeway y=7. The cars on freeway 7 at turn 17 are:\n  - Car 1: (head=54, tail=43, direction=right, speed=6) → Span = [43, 54] (0 not in span)\n  - Car 2: (head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, speed=6) → Span = [-35, -24] (0 not in span)\n  - Car 3: (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=6) → Span = [1, 12] (0 not in span)\n  No collision occurs at turn 17 on y=7.\n- If the player moves up (\"U\") at turn 17, they reach y=8 at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, the player is on freeway y=8. The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18 (relative to t₁=17, τ=1) are:\n  - Car 1: [43 + 6×1, 54 + 6×1] = [49, 60] (0 not in span)\n  - Car 2: [-35 + 6×1, -24 + 6×1] = [-29, -18] (0 not in span)\n  - Car 3: [1 + 6×1, 12 + 6×1] = [7, 18] (0 not in span)\n  No collision occurs at turn 18 on y=8.\n- Moving up (\"U\") at turn 18 brings the player to y=9 at turn 19. Since y=9 is not a freeway, no car collision is possible, and the goal is reached.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in H=2 turns (actions at turns 17 and 18), which is minimal. No alternative sequence (e.g., staying or moving down) can achieve the goal in fewer turns.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- Turn 17: U (move up to y=8 at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (move up to y=9 at turn 19)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t=18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, with y clamped between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=8 and need to get to y=9, we only need to move up once, but we have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car that spans the x-position 0 at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T, the player is still on y_T, so they only check for cars on y_T at turn T. When they move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, they check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. y=9 is the target, and since there are no cars on y=9 (as cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8), once we get to y=9, we're safe. But we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and that turn should be when we first reach it, I assume.\n\nThe sequence should end when y=9 is reached.\n\nNow, at turn t=18, player is at y=8.\n\ny=8 is a freeway with cars, so we need to check if at turn 18, when the player is on y=8, if there's a car that spans x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t=18.\n\nFirst, for freeway k=1: one car: head 24, tail 13, direction right, speed 12. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1=18, for k=1: head h=24, tail τ=13, direction right, speed s=12.\n\nSo at time T, span is [13 + 12*(T-18), 24 + 12*(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but here all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the direction given.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFor k=1: (24,13,right,12) so direction is right.\n\nk=2: (60,49,right,6) direction right.\n\nk=3: same as k=2, (60,49,right,6)\n\nk=4: same\n\nk=5: same\n\nk=6: same\n\nk=7: three cars: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nk=8: same as k=7: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each time, we need to know if there is a car that spans x=0 at that time.\n\nCollision if for the freeway y that the player is on at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan includes both ends, I assume, since it's [head, tail] or [tail, head], but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so the lower number is τ + s(T-t1), higher is h + s(T-t1), since τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail < head, I think.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ and h such that τ < h, since it says [τ, h] for right-moving initial.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ, I suppose.\n\nBut here all are right-moving, so for each car, at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nNow, 0 is in the span if τ + s(T-t1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t1)\n\nSince the span is inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left-moving here.\n\nNow, for freeway k, which corresponds to y=k.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 18, y=8.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once we move to y=9, we're fine, but we need to be on y=8 at some point to move up.\n\nSince y=9 is the target and no cars, we can just move up when it's safe.\n\nBut moving up takes one turn: at turn T, if we do U, then y_{T+1} = y_T +1, so if y_T=8, and we do U, then at turn T+1, we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y=8, and we need to not collide with cars on y=8 at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay on y=8 for multiple turns, we need to avoid collision each turn.\n\nBut since we start at y=8, and we need to go to y=9, the minimal H should be 1 if we can move up immediately at turn 18, but we need to check if at turn 18, on y=8, there is a collision.\n\nFirst, let's check for y=8 at turn t=18.\n\nFreeway y=8 has three cars:\n\n1. (60,49,right,6) so τ=49, h=60, s=6\n\n2. (-18,-29,right,6) τ=-29, h=-18, s=6\n\n3. (18,7,right,6) τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nAt time T=18, for each car, span is [τ + s*(18-18), h + s*(18-18)] = [τ, h] since T-t1=0.\n\nSo for car1: [49,60]\n\nCar2: [-29,-18]\n\nCar3: [7,18]\n\nNow, x=0: is 0 in any of these spans?\n\n[49,60] : 0 not in, since 49>0\n\n[-29,-18]: 0 not in, since -18<0? -18 < 0, and -29 < -18, so all negative, 0 not in.\n\n[7,18]: 7 to 18, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 18, on y=8, no car spans x=0, so no collision. Player can be here safely.\n\nTherefore, at turn 18, player can choose to move up to y=9.\n\nIf we do U at turn 18, then at turn 19, y=9, which is the target.\n\nH would be 1, since from turn 18 to turn 19, we reach at turn 19.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and we reach at t1+H-1.\n\nt1=18, we start at turn t1.\n\nAfter H turns, we have done actions at t=t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and position at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}, but we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is updated after the action, I think.\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set based on that.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car spanning x=0.\n\nThen we choose a_t for that turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to have y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at y=8 at t=18, if we do U at t=18, then y_{19} = 8 +1 =9, so at turn 19, we are at y=9.\n\nAnd at turn 18, we are on y=8, and as above, no collision at t=18.\n\nThen at turn 19, on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 19 with one action: U at turn 18.\n\nH=1, since one action.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t=18: position (0,8), we do action a_{18}.\n\nThen after action, at turn 19, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, which is turn 19.\n\nNow, is there any issue? But y=9 is not a freeway with cars, so it should be fine.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and y=9 is the top, I think it's safe.\n\nBut let's make sure about the freeway indices.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe or not defined, but since no cars, and player can be there.\n\ny=0 is also possible, but we start at y=8, need to go to y=9.\n\nIn this case, it seems we can go directly.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? Maybe for other starting positions, but here we start at y=8.\n\nPerhaps at other times, if we stay, we might hit cars, but here we don't need to stay.\n\nMaybe I should check if at turn 18, moving up is safe, which it is.\n\nBut let's see the car on y=8.\n\nAnother thing: the player is at (0,8) at t=18, and we need to move to (0,9).\n\nWhen we do U at t=18, we are on y=8 at t=18, no collision, then at t=19, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 at other times that might affect if we delay?\n\nBut since we can go immediately, H=1 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; it might not be that simple, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at turn 18, no collision, but if we move up, we leave immediately.\n\nBut let's check other freeways in case we need to pass through, but since we start at y=8, we only care about y=8 for the turn we are on it.\n\nPerhaps the player could move down or something, but that would increase H, so not minimal.\n\nH=1 seems possible.\n\nBut let me verify the car positions at t=18 for y=8.\n\nCar1: [49,60] at t=18, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but the target is (0,9), which we reach at t=19.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nt1=18, after one action at t=18, at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nBut let me see if for other freeways, cars might be at x=0 at other times, but since we don't go there, it doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to avoid something, but no.\n\nAnother point: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, so we only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen we arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, we care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nHere, for moving to y=9, at turn T, we are on y=8, check cars on y=8 at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, on y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nSo for t=18, we can do U.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? For example, if we were at lower y, but here we are already at y=8.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 18, for y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nMaybe the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the car state for k=7 and k=8, since we might be on them if we move down, but we don't need to.\n\nPerhaps for completeness.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), so x=0 always, we only care when a car spans x=0 at the turn we are on that y.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 18: U\n\nThen we reach at turn 19.\n\nBut H=1, so the sequence is just one action.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo Turn 18: U\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 18, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nCar on y=8: spans at t=18:\n\nFirst car: [49,60], min=49, max=60, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-29,-18], min=-29, max=-18, 0 not in since max=-18<0.\n\nThird car: [7,18], min=7, max=18, 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps at other turns, if we stay, it might be dangerous, but we don't stay.\n\nFor example, let's see when cars on y=8 span x=0.\n\nFor car1: [49 + 6*(T-18), 60 + 6*(T-18)] , set min ≤0≤ max.\n\n49 + 6*(T-18) ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 6*(T-18)\n\nFirst, 49 + 6ΔT ≤ 0, 6ΔT ≤ -49, ΔT ≤ -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so T≤18-8.166=9.833, since T integer, T≤9\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 60 + 6ΔT, always true since min increases.\n\nBut T=18, ΔT=0, 49>0, not ≤0.\n\nSimilarly, for 0 to be in, need min≤0 and max≥0.\n\nHere min=49+6ΔT, which for ΔT≥0 is increasing, always >0, so never ≤0 for T≥18.\n\nSimilarly, max=60+6ΔT >0 always.\n\nSo car1 never spans x=0 for T≥18.\n\nCar2: [-29 +6ΔT, -18 +6ΔT] where ΔT=T-18\n\nMin = -29 +6ΔT, max = -18 +6ΔT\n\nSet min≤0≤ max.\n\n-29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 and -18 +6ΔT ≥0\n\nFirst: -29 +6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤29 => ΔT ≤29/6≈4.833, so ΔT≤4\n\nSecond: -18 +6ΔT ≥0 => 6ΔT≥18 => ΔT≥3\n\nSo for ΔT=3,4\n\nΔT=3: min=-29+18=-11, max=-18+18=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included since span is inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=4: min=-29+24=-5, max=-18+24=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=5: min=-29+30=1, max=-18+30=12, min=1>0, so 0 not ≤ min? min=1, max=12, 0<1, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=2: min=-29+12=-17, max=-18+12=-6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo car2 spans x=0 at ΔT=3 and 4, i.e., T=21 and 22.\n\nT=18+3=21, T=18+4=22.\n\nAt turn 21 and 22, if player is on y=8, and car2 spans x=0, collision.\n\nBut we don't care since we are not staying.\n\nCar3: [7+6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\nMin=7+6ΔT ≥7>0 for ΔT≥0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus on y=8, collision possible only at T=21 and 22 from car2.\n\nBut at T=18, no collision.\n\nSo at t=18, we can safely move up.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we don't need.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we were to stay or move down, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nBut the problem has multiple freeways with cars, perhaps for a different start, but here start is y=8.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nFreeway k=7 and k=8 have multiple cars, but k=8 is y=8, which we have.\n\nk=7 is y=7, etc.\n\nBut since we start at y=8 and go to y=9, we don't go to y=7.\n\nUnless we move down, but that would be counterproductive.\n\nSo I think H=1 is correct.\n\nBut let me check the initial position: player at (0,8), and cars on y=8 at t=18 no issue.\n\nPerhaps the turn numbering: t=18 is current turn, we need to output actions starting from t=18.\n\nAction at t=18: U\n\nThen at t=19, position (0,9), done.\n\nSo the sequence should be Turn 18: U\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut the answer format says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so for H=1, t from 0 to 0, so only a_{t1} = a_{18}\n\nSo output: Turn 18: U\n\nBut perhaps I should write it in the box.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, so y=9 is valid.\n\nCars only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9, no cars.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=18, we are safe, but let's see if moving up requires something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to y=9, at turn t=19, we are on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut the car state for k=7 and k=8 is identical: both have three cars same parameters.\n\nk=7 and k=8 both have (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nBut k=7 is y=7, k=8 is y=8.\n\nBut we don't care about y=7.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but not relevant.\n\nFor example, k=1 has a car, but at t=18, [13,24] for y=1, etc., but not on y=1.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 1.\n\nBut perhaps the player must avoid being on other y when cars are present, but since we start and end without going elsewhere, it should be fine.\n\nMaybe I need to output the sequence for H turns.\n\nSo for this, it's just one action.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects more, but logically it seems correct.\n\nAnother thought: at turn t=18, player is at (0,8), which is on freeway y=8, and we checked no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nPerhaps the collision is only if the car is exactly at x=0, but the span includes it.\n\nYes.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nSo the minimal H is 1, action U at turn 18.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn when we reach.\n\nAfter action at t=18, position at t=19 is (0,9).\n\nAnd t=19 is turn t1 +1, since t1=18, t1+1=19.\n\nWe reach at turn t1 + H, but H is the number of turns, so after H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=1, at turn 19.\n\nThe position at turn t is after the action from t-1, I think.\n\nAt turn t, before any action, position is (0, y_t), then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision check at turn t based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t = k, and on freeway k, car spans x=0 at t, then collision.\n\nAt t=18, y_18=8, cars on y=8 at t=18, no span at 0, so no collision.\n\nThen we choose a_18 = U, so y_19 = 8 + 1 =9.\n\nAt t=19, y_19=9, no freeway or no cars, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nPerhaps for other positions, it might be different, but here it is.\n\nI think I should write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so for this, H=1.\n\nBut let me see if H=0 is possible, but no, we start at y=8, need to go to y=9, so at least one action.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nFrom the sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach.\n\nIn this case, with H=1, we reach at t1 +1.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the last action turn, but position at t1 + H.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the index for the last action.\n\nFor example, actions at t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, position at t=t1+H is the result.\n\nHere t1=18, H=1, action at t=18, position at t=19 is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t=18 and t=19, position at t=20, but we can reach earlier at t=19.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is just one action: at turn 18, U.\n\nSo in the answer format.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on y=8 at t=18.\n\nCar3: (18,7,right,6), at t=18, span [7,18], 0 not in, yes.\n\n(18,7), so head=18, tail=7, so [7,18], 7 to 18, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, for right-moving, tail is smaller, head larger.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nAt turn 18, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 18 are:\n- Car 1: head = 60, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 6 → span = [49, 60]\n- Car 2: head = -18, tail = -29, direction = right, speed = 6 → span = [-29, -18]\n- Car 3: head = 18, tail = 7, direction = right, speed = 6 → span = [7, 18]\n\nNone of these spans include \\(x = 0\\) at turn 18:\n- [49, 60]: all values > 0\n- [-29, -18]: all values < 0\n- [7, 18]: all values > 0\n\nThus, there is no collision at turn 18 on \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe player can move up (U) at turn 18 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. At turn 19, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars, so there is no collision.\n\nThis requires only one action (\\(H = 1\\)), which is minimal since the player must move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 18: U\n\nAfter this action, at turn 19, the player reaches (0, 9).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U }",
