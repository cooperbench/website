The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player moves in the y-direction only (vertically) and the grid for y is 0 to 9. The actions are U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y unchanged). Note that the player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 to 8 (each row y=1,2,...,8). Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for a car at turn T (relative to the current turn t1=2) is:\n\n- For left-moving (but note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check: direction is \"right\" for all. So they are moving to the right.\n\nRight-moving: \n  Initially at turn t1=2: the span is [tau, h] (because head is the front, which is at the right end). \n  Then at turn T (absolute turn, but note T = t1 + t, where t is the number of turns after the current turn), so T = 2 + t.\n  The car moves with speed s (per turn), so at turn T, the car's head becomes h + s*(T-t1) and tail becomes tau + s*(T-t1). \n  Therefore, the span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn and the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T. Specifically, for a car on freeway k, at turn T, we require 0 to be in [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nNote: The problem states that at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is the freeway row) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway, then collision. Also note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only on row y_T at turn T, and not on row y_{T+1} until the next turn. So if at turn T we move from y_T to y_{T+1}, we are only exposed to the cars on y_T at turn T, not to the cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nOur goal: minimize H (the number of turns) and provide the sequence of actions from turn t1=2 to turn t1+H-1 (so H actions) that gets the player to (0,9).\n\nCurrent state: at turn 2, player at (0,0). We start at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8). So we are safe at turn 2.\n\nWe must end at (0,9). Note that 9 is also not a freeway, so once we are at 9 we are safe.\n\nThe challenge is to traverse the freeways (y=1 to y=8) without being at a freeway row when a car's span covers 0.\n\nWe have 8 rows to traverse. We can move up, down, or stay. But we want minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid the cars.\n\nLet's note the car configuration at the current turn (t1=2):\n\nFor freeways 1 to 4, each has two cars:\n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> but note: for right-moving, the head is the larger number? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning from tail (left) to head (right). But here the numbers are negative. Let me check the given:\n\n  For example: (-48, -59, right, 6). Since it's right-moving, the head should be the rightmost, so h should be greater than tau? But -48 > -59, so head=-48, tail=-59? Then the car spans from -59 to -48? That seems odd because they are negative and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the other car: (0, -11, right, 6): head=0, tail=-11 -> so the car covers [-11,0] at turn 2.\n\nWait, note: at turn 2, on freeway 1 (and similarly for 2,3,4) there is a car that covers [-11,0]. That means at x=0, which is our crossing point, this car is present at turn 2? But we are at y=0 at turn 2, so we are not on freeway 1. However, if we move to y=1 at turn 3, then at turn 3 we will be on freeway 1 and we must check the cars on freeway 1 at turn 3.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at turn T (relative to t1=2, so T = 2 + t, where t=0,1,2,...).\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at t1=2, at turn T (absolute) = 2+t, the head becomes h + s*t, and tail becomes tau + s*t.\n\nSo for the car (0, -11, right, 6) on freeway 1 (and similarly for freeways 2,3,4) at turn T=2+t:\n  head(t) = 0 + 6*t\n  tail(t) = -11 + 6*t\n\nWe care about when 0 is in [tail(t), head(t)] = [-11+6t, 0+6t].\n\nSo 0 >= -11+6t and 0 <= 6t? \nBut note: the interval is [tail(t), head(t)] and since tail(t) <= head(t) (because -11+6t <= 6t), we have:\n  0 in [ -11+6t, 6t ] \nif and only if:\n  -11+6t <= 0 <= 6t\n\nBut note: 0 <= 6t is always true for t>=0. So we require:\n  -11+6t <= 0  => 6t <= 11 => t <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSo for integer t (t=0,1,2,...), t=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is closed? The problem doesn't specify open or closed, but typically we assume closed. So at t=0 (which is turn 2), the car covers [-11,0] -> so x=0 is included. But at turn 2 we are not on freeway 1? We are at y=0. So we are safe.\n\nBut if we are at freeway 1 at turn T (which is 2+t), then we require that 0 is not in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFor the car (0, -11, right, 6) on freeway 1:\n  At t (relative) = 0: span = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n  At t=1: span = [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? Yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n  At t=2: span = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6) \n  At t=0: [-59, -48] -> does not include 0? (because -59<=x<=-48, and 0 is not in that interval)\n  At t=1: [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42] -> no\n  At t=2: [-47, -36] -> no\n  ... and so on. So this car never hits 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3,4) the only car that matters is the one that was at (0,-11) at turn 2. It covers 0 at t=0 and t=1 (relative to turn 2) but not at t>=2.\n\nSo for freeway 1, we must avoid being at y=1 at turn 2+t for t=0 and t=1? But note:\n  t=0: turn 2 -> we are at y=0, not y=1 -> safe.\n  t=1: turn 3 -> if we are at y=1 at turn 3, then we are on freeway 1 at turn 3 -> and at that time the car covers [-5,6] which includes 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway 1 at turn 3 (which is t1+1 = 3).\n\nNow let's look at freeways 5 to 8. They have three cars each.\n\nCars:\n  First: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> same as above: never hits 0.\n  Second: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> \n      At t=0: [-23, -12] -> no 0.\n      At t=1: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6] -> no.\n      At t=2: [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=0? Actually, the head at t=2 is -12+12=0? Let me compute:\n        head(t) = -12 + 6*t\n        tail(t) = -23 + 6*t\n      At t=2: tail(2)= -23+12 = -11, head(2)= -12+12=0 -> so [ -11, 0] -> includes 0.\n      At t=3: [-5,6] -> includes 0.\n      At t=4: [1,12] -> no.\n\n  Third: (24, 13, right, 6) -> \n      head(t) = 24 + 6*t\n      tail(t) = 13 + 6*t\n      At t=0: [13,24] -> no 0.\n      t=1: [19,30] -> no.\n      ... so never hits 0.\n\nSo for freeways 5 to 8, the dangerous car is the second one: it covers 0 at t=2 and t=3 (relative to t1=2, so absolute turns 4 and 5).\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at turn 3 (t=1) because of the car (0,-11) at t=1 -> [ -5,6] includes 0.\n           also at turn 2? But turn 2 we are at y=0, so if we are at freeway 1 at turn 2 we would be hit? But we start at turn 2 at y=0. So we can only be at freeway 1 starting from turn 3.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at turn 3 (t=1) and also at turn 2? But at turn 2 we are not there. So only turn 3? But wait: the car at turn 2 (t=0) is at [ -11,0] -> so if we were at freeway 1 at turn 2, we would be hit. But we are at y=0 at turn 2. So we don't care about turn 2 for freeway 1.\n\nActually, the car state for freeway 1 at turn 2 (current turn) is given. We are not on freeway 1 at turn 2. So the first time we can be on freeway 1 is turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: \n  dangerous at turn 3 (t=1) because car1: [ -5,6] -> includes 0.\n  and at turn 4 (t=2): car1: [1,12] -> safe? so only turn 3 is dangerous for freeway 1.\n\nBut wait, the car (0,-11) at turn 2 (t=0) is [ -11,0] -> dangerous, but we are not there. At turn 3 (t=1) it becomes [-5,6] -> dangerous. At turn 4 (t=2) it becomes [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 1: dangerous only at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 1? Yes, because they have the same cars. So each of freeway 1,2,3,4 is dangerous only at turn 3.\n\nBut note: if we are on freeway 1 at turn 3, we get hit. Similarly for 2,3,4.\n\nNow freeway 5 to 8: dangerous at turns 4 and 5 (because of the second car: at t=2 -> turn 4: [ -11,0] -> wait, no: for the second car in freeway5: \n  At t=2 (relative): tail(2)= -23+12 = -11, head(2)= -12+12=0 -> so [ -11,0] -> dangerous? \n  But note: at t=2 (absolute turn 4) the car covers [ -11,0] -> so if we are at freeway5 at turn 4, we get hit.\n\n  At t=3 (absolute turn 5): [ -23+18, -12+18] = [ -5,6] -> dangerous.\n\n  At t=4: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at turns 4 and 5.\n\nNow, we must plan a path from y=0 (turn 2) to y=9 (as soon as possible) without being at:\n\n  - At turn 3 (t=1): cannot be at freeway 1,2,3,4 (y=1,2,3,4) -> because they are dangerous.\n  - At turn 4 (t=2): cannot be at freeway 5,6,7,8 (y=5,6,7,8) -> dangerous.\n  - At turn 5 (t=3): cannot be at freeway 5,6,7,8 (y=5,6,7,8) -> dangerous.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=0 or y=9 at any time without danger.\n\nWhat about other turns? For freeways 1-4, only turn 3 is dangerous. For freeways 5-8, only turns 4 and 5 are dangerous. Other turns are safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal H would be the minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9, which is 9 moves up (if we only go up). But we have to avoid the dangerous situations.\n\nWe start at turn 2 at y=0.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4 at turn 3 (which is the next turn, t=1 relative).\n\nWe must avoid being at y=5,6,7,8 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nLet's consider the moves:\n\nWe are at turn 2: y=0.\n\nAt turn 3 (first move): we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up (U) at turn 2 (to take effect at turn 3): then at turn 3 we are at y=1 -> but that's freeway 1 -> and turn 3 is dangerous for freeway 1 -> collision.\n\nIf we stay (S): at turn 3 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nIf we go down (D): but y=-1 is not allowed, so we stay at 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and we clamp to [0,9]. So D at y=0 would stay at 0. So same as S.\n\nSo at turn 2 (current turn) we must choose S (or D, but same effect) to stay at y=0 for turn 3.\n\nSo turn 2: action S -> at turn 3 we are at y=0.\n\nNow at turn 3: we are at y=0. We are safe because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9. We must avoid freeways 1-4 at turn 3? We already passed turn 3 without being on freeways 1-4.\n\nNow at turn 3: we can choose an action for turn 4.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 5-8 at turn 4 and turn 5.\n\nTurn 4: we are at turn t1+2 = 4 (absolute). We must not be at y=5,6,7,8 at turn 4.\n\nTurn 5: we must not be at y=5,6,7,8 at turn 5.\n\nWe are currently at y=0 (turn 3). We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe have to move up. But we have to avoid the danger zones at turns 4 and 5.\n\nWe can consider:\n\nOption 1: Move up as fast as possible, but we must not be in freeways 5-8 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 3: we are at y=0.\n\nAt turn 4: we choose an action at turn 3. We can choose U: then at turn 4 we are at y=1 -> safe? because freeway 1 is only dangerous at turn 3? and turn 4 is safe for freeway 1. Similarly, freeways 2,3,4 are safe at turn 4.\n\nBut note: we are at y=1 at turn 4 -> freeway 1? But freeway 1 is safe at turn 4 (because the car that was dangerous at turn 3 is now at [1,12] and doesn't cover 0). So safe.\n\nBut we must avoid freeways 5-8 at turn 4 and 5. So at turn 4 we can be at y=1, which is freeway 1, but that's safe.\n\nThen at turn 4: we can choose U again: then at turn 5 we are at y=2 -> safe? because freeway 2 is safe at turn 5? (since freeway 2 is only dangerous at turn 3). So yes.\n\nBut then at turn 5: we are at y=2. Then we can move up again: at turn 6 we are at y=3 -> safe? freeway 3 safe at turn 6? yes.\n\nBut we must get to y=9. We are at turn 6: y=3. Then we can keep going up: at turn 7: y=4, turn 8: y=5, turn 9: y=6, turn 10: y=7, turn 11: y=8, turn 12: y=9.\n\nBut wait: at turn 8: we are at y=5 (freeway 5) at turn 8. But freeway 5 is dangerous only at turns 4 and 5? So turn 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9: y=6 at turn 9 -> safe? yes.\n\nSo this path: \n  Turn2: S -> y=0 at turn3\n  Turn3: U -> y=1 at turn4\n  Turn4: U -> y=2 at turn5\n  Turn5: U -> y=3 at turn6\n  Turn6: U -> y=4 at turn7\n  Turn7: U -> y=5 at turn8\n  Turn8: U -> y=6 at turn9\n  Turn9: U -> y=7 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> y=8 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> y=9 at turn12\n\nTotal turns: 11 moves? But note: we start at turn2 and we take 11 actions? Then the last action is at turn2+10 = turn12? And then at turn12 we are at y=9. So H=11? But note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H is the number of actions. We have 11 actions: from turn2 to turn12 (which is 11 steps: 2 to 12 is 10 steps? Let me count: from turn2 to turn3: one step, ... to turn12: 10 steps? Actually:\n\nWe take an action at turn2, then at turn3, ... up to turn12? That would be 11 actions (turn2, turn3, ..., turn12). But the goal is to be at y=9 at the end of the sequence? The last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1. And after that action, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above, after the 11th action (at turn12) we go from y=8 to y=9. So we are at y=9 at turn13? No.\n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n- At the start of turn2: we are at (0,0). We choose an action for turn2 (which will determine y at turn3).\n- After we choose an action at turn2, we move to turn3 with the new y.\n\nSo:\n  Turn2: choose action -> at turn3, y is updated.\n  Turn3: choose action -> at turn4, y is updated.\n\nTherefore, after H actions (taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), we will be at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nWe start at turn2 (t1=2) and we want y_{2+H} = 9.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n  Action at turn2: S -> y3 = 0\n  Action at turn3: U -> y4 = 1\n  Action at turn4: U -> y5 = 2\n  Action at turn5: U -> y6 = 3\n  Action at turn6: U -> y7 = 4\n  Action at turn7: U -> y8 = 5\n  Action at turn8: U -> y9 = 6\n  Action at turn9: U -> y10 = 7\n  Action at turn10: U -> y11 = 8\n  Action at turn11: U -> y12 = 9\n\nSo we take 10 actions (from turn2 to turn11) and at turn12 we are at y=9. So H=10? \n\nBut note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we have H actions. Here, we have actions at turn2, turn3, ..., turn11: that's 10 turns (2 to 11 inclusive is 10 actions). So H=10.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe were stuck at turn3: we had to stay at y=0. Then we started moving up. But we lost one turn.\n\nAlternatively, at turn3 we are at y=0. We could move up multiple times? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nBut note: we are free to move up as much as we want, but we must avoid the danger at freeways 5-8 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=0.\n\nIf we move up at turn3: then at turn4 we are at y=1 -> safe (as above).\n\nBut then at turn4: we are at y=1. We can move up again to y=2 at turn5 -> safe.\n\nBut then at turn5: we are at y=2. We can move up to y=3 at turn6, then to y=4 at turn7, then to y=5 at turn8 -> but freeways 5-8 are only dangerous at turns 4 and 5, so turn8 is safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider moving up twice and then waiting? But that would be slower.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nAnother idea: can we get above the dangerous freeways 5-8 during turns 4 and 5? But we are starting at y=0 at turn3. To get to y=5 (which is the start of the dangerous freeways) we need 5 moves. So at turn4: y=1, turn5: y=2, turn6: y=3, turn7: y=4, turn8: y=5. So we cannot be above freeway 4 until turn8? \n\nBut at turn4 and turn5 we are at y=1 and y=2, which are safe.\n\nSo the above plan is safe and takes 10 actions.\n\nBut let me check if we can reach faster by not staying at turn2? We saw we couldn't because at turn3 we would be at y=1 which is dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, what if we go up at turn2? Then at turn3 we are at y=1 -> collision. So that's not possible.\n\nWhat if we go down? But we are at y=0, so we stay. So we have to stay at turn2.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10? But maybe we can do 9? \n\nTo get from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 moves up. And we have to take at least one stay (at turn2) because we cannot move up at turn2. So total moves: at least 9 moves up and one stay -> 10 moves? \n\nBut note: we don't necessarily need to use only up and stay. We might use down? But that would increase the total moves.\n\nSo 10 is the minimum? Let me see:\n\nWe start at turn2: y=0.\nWe must not be at freeways 1-4 at turn3 -> so we cannot move up at turn2 -> we must stay at turn2 (so one stay).\nThen we need 9 moves up. Total 10 moves.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn2: S\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\n\nThen at turn12: we are at y=9.\n\nBut let me verify the dangerous freeways:\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=0 -> safe.\nAt turn4: y=1 -> freeway1: safe because turn4 is safe (car at [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? Actually, 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe).\nAt turn5: y=2 -> freeway2: safe? because the car on freeway2 at turn5: \n  The car that was (0,-11) at turn2: at turn5 (t=3) -> head = 0+6*3=18, tail=-11+18=7 -> [7,18] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\nAt turn6: y=3 -> freeway3: same as above -> safe.\nAt turn7: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\nAt turn8: y=5 -> freeway5: at turn8 (t=6 relative to turn2): \n  The dangerous car on freeway5: the second car: at t=6: tail=-23+6*6 = -23+36=13, head=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\nAt turn9: y=6 -> freeway6: same -> safe.\nAt turn10: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\nAt turn11: y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\nAt turn12: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nBut wait, at turn5: we are at y=2. What about the car on freeway2? \n  The car on freeway2: \n      First car: (-48,-59) -> at turn5: [-59+6*3, -48+6*3] = [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> no.\n      Second car: (0,-11) at turn2: at turn5: [ -11+18, 0+18] = [7,18] -> no.\n  So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn8: freeway5: \n  Cars: \n      First: (-48,-59) -> at t=6: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> no.\n      Second: (-12,-23) -> at t=6: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> no.\n      Third: (24,13) -> at t=6: [13+36,24+36] = [49,60] -> no.\n  So safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t1 (turn2) to t1+H-1 (turn2+9 = turn11). So we write:\n\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn11, which takes us from y=8 (at turn11) to y=9 (at turn12).\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here, t_1=2, H=10, so t from 0 to 9: \n  t=0: a_{2+0} = a_2 = S\n  t=1: a_3 = U\n  ...\n  t=9: a_{11} = U\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 moves? That would require 9 actions. Then we would be at y=9 at turn2+9 = turn11.\n\nBut to get from y=0 (turn2) to y=9 (turn11) in 9 moves, we need 9 up moves and no stay. But at turn2 we must not move up (because then at turn3 we would be at y=1 and collide). So we cannot avoid the stay at turn2. Therefore, 10 is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go up at turn2 and then down? But that would not help.\n\nFor example:\n  Turn2: U -> at turn3: y=1 -> collision. Not possible.\n\nSo we have the minimal solution.\n\nBut note: we could consider moving up later? But that would only take more turns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis of car movements and collision conditions shows that:\n\n- Freeways 1 to 4 are dangerous only at turn 3 (absolute turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 3\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeways 5 to 8 are dangerous at turns 4 and 5 (absolute turns \\(t_1 + 2 = 4\\) and \\(t_1 + 3 = 5\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n\nStarting at turn 2 with \\(y = 0\\):\n- At turn 2, moving up (U) would place the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3, causing a collision on freeway 1. Thus, the player must stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 3.\n- From turn 3 onwards, moving up (U) each turn is safe, as:\n  - At turn 4, \\(y = 1\\) is safe (freeway 1 is no longer dangerous).\n  - At turn 5, \\(y = 2\\) is safe (freeway 2 is no longer dangerous).\n  - Subsequent turns (6 to 11) move the player through freeways 3 to 8 safely, as the dangerous periods for freeways 5-8 have passed by turn 6.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, with actions from turn 2 to turn 11. The sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 without any collisions.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n```\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n```\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: S \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving right with speed 6, so their positions shift to the right over time.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions at any given turn. Since all cars are moving right at speed 6, for any turn T after t1=3, the position of a car that was at [h, τ] at t1 will be at [h + 6*(T-3), τ + 6*(T-3)] because they're all right-moving.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], but in the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is on the right, tail on left? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). For right-moving, direction right, so when moving right, the head is to the right of tail, I assume. In the span update, for right-moving: [Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]], so this implies that τ is the left end and h is the right end, since it goes from τ to h with τ < h.\n\nIn the initial state at t1=3, for example, freeway 1: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6). -42 and -53, but -42 > -53? -42 is greater than -53, so if τ is tail and h is head, for right-moving, head should be larger x, so h = -42, τ = -53? But -42 > -53, so [h, τ] = [-42, -53] which is decreasing, but span should be from left to right.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation. Let's look back at the car update.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], which suggests that τ is the left end and h is the right end. Similarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h left, τ right or something? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's left-moving, moving left, so head should be on the left? But [h, τ] with h and τ, and then both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ must be the left end, h the right end.\n\nIn the car state table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor a right-moving car, head should be the front, so when moving right, head has higher x, so h should be larger than τ. For example, in freeway 1: (6, -5, right, 6), so h=6, τ=-5, and 6 > -5, so left end is τ=-5, right end is h=6, so span at t1=3 is [-5,6].\n\nSimilarly, (-42,-53,right,6): h=-42, τ=-53, -42 > -53, so left end τ=-53, right end h=-42, span [-53,-42].\n\nBut -53 to -42, both negative, so to the left of x=0.\n\nNow, for collision: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we need to avoid that for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, if at turn T you are at y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 3. y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. The goal is to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut at turn T, if you are on y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but avoiding the cars when on those rows.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to find a time when for each row, when I'm on it, 0 is not covered by a car on that row.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nFirst, all cars are on freeways 1 to 8, and all have the same cars per group.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 2,3,4 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nBut (30,19,right,6): h=30, τ=19, so for right-moving, span at t1=3 is [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nSimilarly, (-6,-17,right,6): τ=-17, h=-6, span [-17,-6]\n\nAnd (-42,-53,right,6): τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T, if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [left(T), right(T)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars move at speed 6, position at T: for a car with initial left L, right R at t1=3, at time T, left = L + 6*(T-3), right = R + 6*(T-3)\n\nFor a car, at t1, span is [left, right], then at T, for right-moving, it's [left + 6*(T-3), right + 6*(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nSo let's define for each car, the left and right at t1.\n\nFor freeways 1-4:\n\nCar A: at t1, left = -53, right = -42  (from (-42,-53,right,6), span [τ,h] = [-53,-42])\n\nCar B: at t1, left = -5, right = 6  (from (6,-5,right,6), span [-5,6])\n\nFor freeways 5-8:\n\nCar A: same as above, left=-53, right=-42\n\nCar C: (-6,-17,right,6), so left = -17, right = -6\n\nCar D: (30,19,right,6), so left=19, right=30\n\nNow, for a given freeway k and time T, 0 is covered if for some car on k, left(T) <= 0 <= right(T)\n\nleft(T) = left + 6*(T-3)\n\nright(T) = right + 6*(T-3)\n\nNow, T is turn number, integer.\n\nWe need to find times when 0 is not covered for each row.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, for each row, when we are on it, it must be clear.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 3, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end.\n\nThe actions are taken at each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo the path in y over time.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal steps without cars would be 9 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions, so we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut going down might not help since cars are moving, and we want to minimize time, so probably best to go up directly, but time when rows are clear.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nThat is, for each k, the set of T where 0 is in some car's span on row k.\n\nThen, when we are at y=k at turn T, it must be that T is not in the covered times for k.\n\nSince the rows are independent, we can find for each row the safe times.\n\nBut the player moves sequentially, so we need a sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each row the covered intervals.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (same for 1,2,3,4)\n\nCars: car A: left=-53, right=-42 at T=3\n\ncar B: left=-5, right=6 at T=3\n\nNow, 0 covered by car A if left(T) <= 0 <= right(T)\n\nleft(T) = -53 + 6*(T-3)\n\nright(T) = -42 + 6*(T-3)\n\nSet left(T) <= 0 <= right(T)\n\n-53 + 6*(T-3) <= 0 and 0 <= -42 + 6*(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 6(T-3) <= 0 => 6(T-3) <= 53 => T-3 <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so T-3 <= 8 since T integer? T-3 <= 8.833, so for T-3 from ? to ?\n\n-53 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 53 => ΔT <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so ΔT <= 8 since integer? ΔT = T-3\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -42 + 6ΔT => 42 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 42/6 = 7\n\nSo for car A: covered when ΔT >=7 and ΔT <=8\n\nΔT >=7 and ΔT <=8.833, but ΔT integer, so ΔT =7,8\n\nSimilarly, right(T) >=0: -42 +6ΔT >=0 => 6ΔT >=42 => ΔT >=7\n\nleft(T) <=0: -53 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=53 => ΔT <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so ΔT <=8 for integer.\n\nΔT <=8.833, so ΔT=0 to 8? ΔT integer, ΔT <=8.833 means ΔT <=8 since 8.833, T-3=8, left(T) = -53 +6*8 = -53+48= -5 <=0, right(T)= -42+48=6 >=0? 0 <=6 yes.\n\nΔT=9, left= -53+54=1 >0? left(T)= -53 +6*9= -53+54=1 >0, so 0 not <= left, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=7: left= -53+42= -11 <=0, right= -42+42=0, 0<=0 true, so covered.\n\nΔT=8: left= -53+48= -5 <=0, right= -42+48=6 >=0, covered.\n\nΔT=6: left= -53+36= -17 <=0, right= -42+36= -6 <0, so 0 not <= right(T), since -6<0, so 0 not in [-17,-6], so not covered.\n\nΔT=9: left=1>0, right=6>0, 0 not in [1,6]\n\nSo car A covers 0 only at ΔT=7 and 8, i.e., T=10 and 11.\n\nT=3 + ΔT, so T=10 and 11.\n\nNow car B: left=-5, right=6 at T=3\n\nleft(T) = -5 +6ΔT\n\nright(T) =6 +6ΔT\n\n0 covered if left(T) <=0 <= right(T)\n\n-5 +6ΔT <=0 and 0 <=6 +6ΔT\n\nSecond inequality always true since right(T) >=6 >0 for ΔT>=0\n\nFirst: -5 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <=5/6 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer? ΔT >=0\n\nΔT = T-3, T>=3.\n\n-5 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so for ΔT=0, it holds? ΔT=0: left(3)= -5 <=0, right=6>=0, so yes.\n\nΔT=1: left= -5+6=1>0, so not covered.\n\nSo car B covers 0 only at ΔT=0, i.e., T=3.\n\nFor freeway 1, at T=3, car B covers 0.\n\nAt T=10 and 11, car A covers 0.\n\nOther times, no car covers 0 on freeway 1.\n\nCars: A and B, B covers at T=3, A at T=10,11.\n\nAt T=4, for example, car B: left= -5+6=1>0, not cover; car A: left=-53+6= -47, right=-42+6=-36, both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, until T=10.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at T=3,10,11.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4 same as 1.\n\nNow freeways 5-8.\n\nFor freeway 5 (same for 5,6,7,8)\n\nCars: car A: left=-53, right=-42 (same as before)\n\ncar C: (-6,-17,right,6) so left=-17, right=-6 at T=3\n\ncar D: (30,19,right,6) so left=19, right=30 at T=3\n\nFirst, car A: same as before, covers 0 at T=10 and 11.\n\nCar C: left=-17, right=-6 at T=3\n\nleft(T) = -17 +6ΔT\n\nright(T) = -6 +6ΔT\n\n0 covered if -17+6ΔT <=0 and 0 <= -6+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -17+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=17 => ΔT <=17/6≈2.833, so ΔT<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6+6ΔT => 6 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo covered when ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=2, i.e., T=4 and 5.\n\nΔT=1: left=-17+6=-11<=0, right=-6+6=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=2: left=-17+12=-5<=0, right=-6+12=6>=0, covered.\n\nΔT=3: left=-17+18=1>0, not covered.\n\nCar D: left=19, right=30, both positive at T=3, and increasing, left(T)=19+6ΔT >=19>0, so always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe when:\n\n- car C covers at T=4,5\n\n- car A covers at T=10,11\n\n- car D never covers\n\nSo unsafe at T=4,5,10,11\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8 same.\n\nNow freeways 1-4: unsafe at T=3,10,11\n\nFreeways 5-8: unsafe at T=4,5,10,11\n\nT=10 and 11 unsafe for all freeways.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 3, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nThe vertical moves: we can go up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but we need to cross the rows when they are safe.\n\nSince we start at T=3, y=0.\n\nAt T=3, if we go up to y=1, but y=1 is freeway, and at T=3, freeway 1 is unsafe (since T=3 unsafe for row 1), so if we are on y=1 at T=3, collision.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe take action at turn T to move to next position.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn for the position at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), and we need no car on row y_T covering x=0 at that turn T.\n\nIf y_T is not 1-8, no car, safe.\n\nWe start at T=3, y_3 = 0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y_{3+H-1} = 9 for some H, with y_{3+H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=3 to t=3+H-2, I think.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t1 = 3.\n\nPlayer at turn t: y_t\n\nAction at turn t: a_t, determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nFor t from t1 to t1 + H -1, with y_{t1} =0, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns including start and end? Let's see the action sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it says actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + something.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWhen we apply action at turn t, it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, we are at y_t, so collision check at (0, y_t) for time t.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t+1, at (0, y_{t+1}) for time t+1.\n\nWe start at t=3, y_3=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y_{3+H-1} =9.\n\nThe actions are for t=3 to t=3+H-2, I think, to go to t=3+H-1.\n\nLet's clarify the indices.\n\nSuppose at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1? The actions are a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}, and after these H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, to y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to after a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9? But in the problem, it says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso, in the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions a_{t1 +0} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nAfter applying these H actions, from y_{t1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}? No.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, we are at y_{t1}.\n\nWe apply action a_{t1}, which moves us to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nThen apply a_{t1+1}, to y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2, and so on, apply a_{t1 + H -1}, to y_{t1 + H} at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at some turn, which is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut to reach there, we apply actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2 to get to y_{t1 + H -1} at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet me define the turn when we are at position.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T at turn T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen, for the sequence, we start at T = t1, y_{t1} given.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1 + K} for some K, to reach y_{t1 + K +1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t1 + K +1, we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is K+1, and the number of turns from start to end is (t1 + K +1) - t1 +1 = K+2 turns? Let's not confuse.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo, for t=0, action at t1 +0 = t1, which sets y_{t1+1}\n\nFor t=1, action at t1+1, sets y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, action at t1 + H -1, sets y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -2}, we are at y_{t1 + H -1} at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThen we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about that, as long as at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t1 + H -1} is applied, but it affects y_{t1 + H}, which is after we have reached 9.\n\nFor the position at turn t1 + H -1, it is set by previous actions, not by a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- At turn T, position y_T is determined.\n\n- Action a_T is chosen, setting y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\n- For turn T, collision checked at (0, y_T) with cars at time T.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions from t1 to t1 + H -2 set the position from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Start: turn t1, y_{t1} =0\n\n- Apply a_{t1}: sets y_{t1+1}\n\n- Apply a_{t1+1}: sets y_{t1+2}\n\n- ...\n\n- Apply a_{t1 + H -2}: sets y_{t1 + H -1}\n\n- Then at turn t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\n- Additionally, we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but since we have reached 9 at t1 + H -1, and we don't care about later, but for the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H -1}, but it doesn't affect the position at t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action sequence given, it includes a_{t1 + H -1}, which is for after reaching 9, but since we only care about reaching, we can choose a_{t1 + H -1} arbitrarily, but to be safe, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut in this case, at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start to when we reach 9, including the start turn.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at start position.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t1 + H -1 at position 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t1, we are at position, and we should be at 9, but we are at 0, so not.\n\nH=2: at turn t1, y=0, apply a_{t1}, go to y_{t1+1}, and at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo with one action, from y=0 to y=9 directly, but we can only change by +1,0,-1, so impossible to jump to 9 in one step. Minimal H must be at least 10, since from 0 to 9, need at least 9 up moves, but we can have stays or down, but that increases turns.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should have no down or stay, only up, so H=10, with 9 up moves, reaching at turn t1+9.\n\nt1=3, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut we may need to stay or wait if rows are occupied.\n\nNow, back to the safe times.\n\nPlayer at turn T, on row y_T.\n\nFor y_T from 1 to 8, we need that at that T, the row is safe, i.e., not unsafe as above.\n\nAlso, since we move one row at a time, we need to sequence the crossing.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nFor rows 1-4: unsafe at T=3,10,11\n\nFor rows 5-8: unsafe at T=4,5,10,11\n\nT=10 and 11 unsafe for all.\n\nPlayer starts at T=3, y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately, at T=4, we could be on y=1 or still y=0, etc.\n\nLet's find a path with minimal time.\n\nSince we want to reach as soon as possible, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nNow, at T=3, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, at T=4, y=1.\n\nBut at T=4, if y=1, row 1 is safe at T=4? From above, for row 1, unsafe only at T=3,10,11, so at T=4, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 safe at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if we are on row 1, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nBut let's list the safe times for each row.\n\nRow 1-4: safe for T != 3,10,11, so safe for T=4,5,6,7,8,9,12,... except 10,11.\n\nT=3 unsafe, T=10,11 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-8: unsafe at T=4,5,10,11, so safe for T=3,6,7,8,9,12,... except 4,5,10,11.\n\nT=3 is safe for rows 5-8? T=3, row 5-8 unsafe? No, for rows 5-8, unsafe at T=4,5,10,11, so at T=3, they are safe, but at T=3, if we are on row 5-8, it is safe since not unsafe times.\n\nBut we start at y=0.\n\nNow, to go to y=9, we need to cross each row from 1 to 8 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal time is to go up each turn, so at T=4, y=1; T=5, y=2; ... up to T=12, y=9.\n\nBut at each turn, we need the row to be safe.\n\nCheck for this path: go straight up.\n\nAt T=3: y=0, safe\n\nAction U: to y=1 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=1, row 1, safe? Row 1 safe at T=4, yes.\n\nAction U: to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, row 2, safe at T=5? Rows 1-4 safe except 3,10,11, T=5 not those, so safe.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, row 3, safe, similarly.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=5, row 5.\n\nNow row 5: for rows 5-8, unsafe at T=4,5,10,11.\n\nT=8 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nAction U: to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, row 6, safe at T=9.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=7, row 7.\n\nBut at T=10, all rows 1-8 are unsafe! Because T=10 and 11 unsafe for all.\n\nSo at T=10, if on row 7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, action U to y=8 at T=11: T=11, y=8, row 8, unsafe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=12: safe.\n\nBut at T=10 and T=11, we are on rows 7 and 8, which are unsafe.\n\nSo collision at T=10 and T=11.\n\nThus, straight up from T=3 to T=12 has collisions at T=10 and T=11.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 1-8 at T=10 and T=11.\n\nT=10 and 11 are bad for all rows.\n\nSo we must not be on any freeway row at T=10 or T=11.\n\nThat means at turn 10 and 11, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, we start at T=3, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is, with all up, at T=12, but we have to skip T=10 and 11 on freeways.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, we can delay or something.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if we go all up, we reach y=9 at T=12, but at T=10 we are at y=7, T=11 at y=8, which are bad.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or y=9 at T=10 and T=11.\n\ny=0 at T=10 or 11 is possible if we stay low, but then we reach later.\n\ny=9 at T=10 or earlier.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before T=10?\n\nFrom T=3, to go from y=0 to y=9, minimal 9 up moves, so with no stay or down, we reach at T=12 (since start T=3, after 9 up, at T=12).\n\nT=3: y=0\n\nT=4: y=1 (after first U)\n\n...\n\nT=12: y=9 (after 9th U)\n\nSo cannot reach before T=12.\n\nAt T=12, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=10 and T=11, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are unsafe.\n\nSo for the straight path, collisions at T=10 and T=11.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways at T=10 and T=11.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11. But y=0 at T=10 means we are still low, but we need to go up later, so we will reach later than T=12.\n\n2. Be at y=9 at T=10 or earlier, but impossible since minimal T=12 for y=9.\n\n3. At T=10 and T=11, be at y=0 or y=9, but y=9 not possible before T=12, so only y=0.\n\nBut if at T=10 we are at y=0, that means we haven't moved much, so to go to y=9 from there will take at least 9 more turns, so reach at T=19 or later, which is worse than T=12.\n\nBut T=12 is possible if we can avoid T=10 and T=11 on freeways.\n\nIn the straight path, we are on freeways at T=10 and 11.\n\nWe can modify the path: at some point, stay or go down to avoid being on freeway at T=10 and 11.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11, then after that go up.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=10, since we start at T=3 y=0, we can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut staying will increase time.\n\nWe can go up to some point, then go down to y=0 before T=10, stay there during T=10 and 11, then go up after.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, if we can reach y=9 before T=10, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: reach y=9 at T=12, but for T=10 and 11, if we are not on freeway, but at T=10 we are at y=7, which is freeway.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 earlier, but can't.\n\nPerhaps we can cross the lower rows faster or slower.\n\nList the turns we need to be safe for each row.\n\nWe need to be on row k at some time when it is safe.\n\nFor rows 1-4, safe times: T=4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,... (not 3,10,11)\n\nFor rows 5-8, safe times: T=3,6,7,8,9,12,13,... (not 4,5,10,11)\n\nT=3 is safe for rows 5-8, but at T=3 we are at y=0, not on those rows.\n\nNow, to minimize the turn when we reach y=9, we should cross each row as early as possible when safe.\n\nStart from T=3, y=0.\n\nWe can go to y=1 at T=4, which is safe for row 1.\n\nThen to y=2 at T=5, safe for row 2.\n\nThen to y=3 at T=6, safe for row 3.\n\nThen to y=4 at T=7, safe for row 4.\n\nNow to y=5 at T=8, row 5.\n\nRow 5 safe at T=8? Rows 5-8 safe at T=6,7,8,9,12,... T=8 is safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=9, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, y=6.\n\nNow, if we go U to y=7 at T=10, but T=10 unsafe for all rows.\n\nSo instead, at T=9, we can choose to not go up, but stay or go down.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at T=10? Action at T=9: if we choose S, then at T=10, y=6, row 6, but T=10 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we choose D, to y=5 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=5, row 5, unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=7 or something, but at T=10, whatever freeway we are on, it is unsafe.\n\nSo at T=10, we cannot be on any freeway row; must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for T=11.\n\nBut y=9 not possible yet.\n\nSo only option is to be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=10, we need to go down before that.\n\nFor example, from earlier position, go down to y=0.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nSuppose we go up to some y, then before T=10, go down to y=0.\n\nFor instance, at T=9, we are at y=6, as above.\n\nIf we go down: at T=9, action D, then to y=5 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=5, row 5, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=9, action S, to y=6 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nIf action U, to y=7 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we need to be lower before T=10.\n\nSuppose at T=8, we are at y=4, for example.\n\nFrom above, at T=7, y=4.\n\nAction at T=7: if we go down, to y=3 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=3, row 3, safe (since rows 1-4 safe at T=8).\n\nThen at T=8, action: if we go down to y=2 at T=9, etc.\n\nBut we need to go down to y=0 by T=10.\n\nAt T=8, y=3.\n\nAction D: to y=2 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action D: to y=1 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=1, row 1, but T=10 unsafe for row 1, collision.\n\nAt T=9, action S: to y=2 at T=10, row 2, unsafe.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at T=10, row 3, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to collision at T=10 if on freeway.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=10, we need to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=9, and go down or stay.\n\nBut at T=9, if y=1, and we go D, to y=0 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=11.\n\nLet's plan to be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11.\n\nStart from T=3, y=0.\n\nGo up to some point, then come down to y=0 by T=10.\n\nFor example, we can go up to y=6 at T=9, but as before, from y=6 at T=9, we cannot go directly to y=0 at T=10; we can only go to y=5 or y=7 or stay.\n\nMinimal y at T=10 is y=1 if we go down from y=2 at T=9, but y=1 at T=10 is unsafe.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at T=10, at T=9 we must be at y=1 and go down, or at y=0 and stay.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's go up only to a certain level.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 by T=7: T=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4.\n\nAll safe so far.\n\nNow at T=7, y=4.\n\nInstead of going to y=5, we go down.\n\nAction at T=7: D, to y=3 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nAction at T=8: D, to y=2 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nAction at T=9: D, to y=1 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=1, but row 1 at T=10 unsafe, collision! Oh no.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at T=9, we go S to y=2 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nOr U to y=3 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be on freeway at T=10.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=10, at T=9 we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at T=9, y=0, then action S or U or D, but to stay at y=0, action S or D? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, if at y=0, action D: y= -1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), so at y=0, action D: y=0, cannot go below 0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, action U: y=9.\n\nSo at y=0, action D or S: y=0, action U: y=1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, action U or S: y=9, action D: y=8.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at T=10, at T=9 we must be at y=0 and choose action S or D, or at y=1 and choose action D to go to y=0.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo for T=10, to be at y=0:\n\n- At T=9, be at y=0 and action S or D, or at y=1 and action D.\n\nSimilarly, for T=11, to be at y=0, similar.\n\nBut we also need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, back to timing.\n\nSuppose we go up slowly or something.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe at T=3, but at T=3 we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nWe can go to higher rows earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=3, y=0, action U to y=1 at T=4.\n\nBut row 1 at T=4 is safe.\n\nCan we go directly to row 5 or something? No, only adjacent moves.\n\nWe have to move step by step.\n\nThe only way to avoid T=10 and 11 on freeways is to be at y=0 or y=9 at those turns.\n\nSince y=9 not possible before T=12, we must be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=10, we need to not have gone too far up.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nAt T=3, action S: stay at y=0 for T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can stay at y=0 until some turn, then go up after T=11.\n\nBut T=11 is unsafe, so after T=11, safe times resume.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 from T=3 to T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=0.\n\nAction U to y=1 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=1, row 1, unsafe! Collision.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=10, at T=10 we must have y=0.\n\nSo at T=9, we need to be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nIf at T=9, y=0, then action S or D, stay at y=0 for T=10.\n\nOr if at T=9, y=1, action D to y=0 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for T=11.\n\nSo let's set that at T=10 and T=11, we are at y=0.\n\nFor that, at T=9, we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nTo minimize time, we should be as high as possible before, but since we have to go down or stay, it might increase time.\n\nStart from T=3, y=0.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=1 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nNow at T=4, we can go to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nBut we need to be low at T=9.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=4 or something, then come down.\n\nBut let's calculate the turns to be at y=0 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=0.\n\nAt T=9, to have y=0 at T=10, either:\n\n- at T=9, y=0, and action S or D\n\n- or at T=9, y=1, and action D\n\nSimilarly, for T=11, y=0.\n\nNow, from start, we can go up to some level, then come down to y=1 by T=9, and go down to y=0 at T=10.\n\nThen stay at y=0 for T=11, or something.\n\nBut let's see the earliest we can reach y=9 after that.\n\nFirst, at T=10, y=0.\n\nThen we start going up from there.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=10, to y=9, minimal at T=19, since T=10 y=0, T=11 y=1, ..., T=19 y=9.\n\nBut at T=11, we need to be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nIf at T=10, y=0, and we want at T=11 y=0, we can stay.\n\nThen at T=11, y=0.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nT=11 y=0, T=12 y=1, ..., T=20 y=9.\n\nBut T=20 is later than the straight path which has collision but at T=12 we can be at y=9 if we avoid collision.\n\nWith this, we reach at T=20, which is worse.\n\nBut with straight path we can reach at T=12 if we solve the collision.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at T=12, but for T=10 and 11, be at y=0.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=10 and 11, we need to be low at that time, so we can't be high at T=12.\n\nConflict.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=12, we can be at y=9, and T=12 is safe for all rows, so if we can arrive at T=12 without being on freeway at T=10 and 11.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=12, we must be at y=8 at T=11, which is freeway, and T=11 unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, y=8 for the straight path.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at T=11.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at T=11, but impossible.\n\nSo the only way is to delay the ascent or descend before T=10.\n\nBut descending means we waste turns.\n\nPerhaps we can cross some rows earlier or later to avoid the bad times.\n\nFor example, for rows 1-4, they are safe at T=9.\n\nRows 5-8 safe at T=9.\n\nT=9 is safe for all rows.\n\nSimilarly, T=6,7,8,9 are safe for all, except rows 5-8 unsafe at T=4,5, but T=4,5 are past.\n\nT=3 is start.\n\nSo from T=6 to T=9, all rows are safe.\n\nT=6: rows 1-4 safe, rows 5-8 safe at T=6? Rows 5-8 unsafe at T=4,5, so T=6 safe.\n\nT=7,8,9 all safe.\n\nT=10,11 unsafe.\n\nT=12 safe.\n\nSo the safe window is T=6 to T=9 and T=12 on.\n\nIf we can cross all rows between T=6 and T=9, that is 4 turns, but there are 8 rows to cross, from y=0 to y=9, we need to cover 9 levels, but y=0 to y=1 is one move, etc.\n\nFrom y=0 at some T to y=9 at T+9.\n\nWith 4 turns, we can at most go up 4 steps, to y=4, for example.\n\nNot enough to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we start from y=0 at T=5, then T=6 y=1, T=7 y=2, T=8 y=3, T=9 y=4, only to y=4 at T=9.\n\nThen after T=9, we have to go further, but T=10 and 11 bad.\n\nThen at T=9 y=4, we can go down to y=0 by T=10, but as before, difficult.\n\nAt T=9 y=4, action D to y=3 at T=10, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y at T=9.\n\nMax at T=9: if we start going up from T=3.\n\nT=3 y=0\n\nT=4 y=1\n\nT=5 y=2\n\nT=6 y=3\n\nT=7 y=4\n\nT=8 y=5\n\nT=9 y=6\n\nAt T=9, y=6.\n\nThen we need to avoid T=10 and 11 on freeway.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=9, if we go down, to y=5 at T=10, collision.\n\nOr stay, y=6 at T=10, collision.\n\nOr up, y=7 at T=10, collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nBut at T=9, y=6 is on freeway, but T=9 is safe, no problem at T=9.\n\nThe problem is T=10 and 11.\n\nSo from T=9, we need to move to a safe row, but no safe row at T=10 except y=0 or 9.\n\nSo we must go to y=0 or y=9 from y=6 at T=9, but in one move, impossible.\n\nSo the only possibility is to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=9, so that we can go to y=0 at T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=9, be at y=1, then action D to y=0 at T=10.\n\nOr at y=0, stay.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=9.\n\nFrom start, we can go up to y=1 and stay or something.\n\nBut let's accept that we need to waste some turns to avoid the bad times.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11, and then go up.\n\nFirst, be at y=0 at T=10.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=10, at T=9 we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly for T=11.\n\nSet T=9: be at y=1, for example.\n\nThen at T=9, action D to y=0 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, action S to stay at y=0 for T=11, or action D, same.\n\nThen at T=11, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, action U to y=1 at T=12.\n\nThen continue up to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut T=20 is late.\n\nFrom T=11 y=0, T=12 y=1, T=13 y=2, ..., T=20 y=9.\n\nReach at T=20.\n\nBut with the straight path, we can reach at T=12 with collisions, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nAnother idea: since T=12 is safe, and we can be at y=9 at T=12, but to avoid being on freeway at T=10 and 11, we can be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11, but then at T=11 y=0, to go to y=9 at T=12 impossible.\n\nSo impossible to reach at T=12 without being on freeway at T=11, since at T=11 we must be at y=8 to reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut y=8 at T=11 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for any path to reach y=9 at T, at turn T-1 we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=8, then at turn T-1, on row 8, which must be safe at that turn.\n\nIf at y=9, then at turn T-1, we are at y=9, safe, but to be at y=9 at T-1, we must have been there earlier.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T=12, at T=11 we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=9 at T=11, then we reached early, but impossible before T=12.\n\nSo must be at y=8 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, row 8 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=12 without collision at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for any T<12, impossible to reach.\n\nFor T=12, it is impossible to avoid collision at T=11.\n\nThe earliest possible to reach y=9 is T=12, but it requires being at y=8 at T=11, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot reach at T=12; we must reach later.\n\nNext possible: T=13.\n\nAt T=13, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=13, at T=12 we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nT=12 is safe for all rows, so if at y=8 at T=12, safe, then action U to y=9 at T=13.\n\nOr at y=9 at T=12, then action S or U or D, but to stay at y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=12, we need to arrive earlier, impossible, so must be at y=8 at T=12.\n\nT=12 is safe for row 8, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, we must not be on freeway, so be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at T=11, so be at y=0 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for T=10.\n\nSo for T=13 reach, we need:\n\n- At T=12, be at y=8\n\n- At T=11, be at y=0 (since not on freeway)\n\n- At T=10, be at y=0\n\nNow, at T=11, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=0 at T=11, at T=10 we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly for T=10.\n\nAlso, at T=12, be at y=8.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=11 to y=8 at T=12, impossible in one step, since can only change by 1.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at T=12, which requires that at T=11 we are at y=7,8, or9.\n\nBut at T=11, we must be at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nContradiction.\n\nAt T=11, we are at y=0, but to be at y=8 at T=12, we need to go from y=0 to y=8 in one step, impossible.\n\nSo for T=13 reach, at T=12 we are at y=8, so at T=11 we must be at y=7,8, or9.\n\nBut at T=11, if we are at y=7 or8, on freeway, unsafe.\n\nIf at y=9, safe, but impossible at T=11.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach at T=13 with the constraints.\n\nSimilarly, for T=14 reach.\n\nAt T=14, y=9.\n\nThen at T=13, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nT=13 is safe for all, so if at y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=12, we must be at y=7,8,9 to reach y=8 or9 at T=13.\n\nT=12 safe, so possible.\n\nBut at T=11, we must not be on freeway, so y=0 or9.\n\nSimilarly T=10, y=0 or9.\n\nNow, y=9 not possible at T=10 or11, so must be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=0.\n\nAt T=12, we need to be at some y to reach y=8 at T=13.\n\nFrom T=11 y=0, to T=12, we can go to y=1 (action U), or stay y=0, or down, but y=0.\n\nThen at T=12, y=1.\n\nThen to be at y=8 at T=13, impossible, from y=1 to y=8 in one step.\n\nMax we can be at T=13 is y=4 or something from T=11.\n\nT=11 y=0\n\nT=12 y=1 (after U)\n\nT=13 y=2 (after U)\n\n etc, to reach y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut at T=13, y=2, not y=8.\n\nTo reach y=8 at T=13, we need to be at y=7,8,9 at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, we can be at high y.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=8 at T=12, then at T=13 we can go to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=12, we need to have crossed the rows before.\n\nBut at T=10 and 11, we are at y=0, so we are low.\n\nFrom T=11 y=0, at T=12 we can be at y=1.\n\nNot high.\n\nSo to be high at T=12, we need to have crossed the rows before T=10 or after T=11.\n\nFor example, cross most rows between T=6 to T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, be at high y, say y=6 as before.\n\nThen from T=9 to T=10, we go to y=0, but we can't in one step.\n\nUnless we are at y=1 at T=9, then go down to y=0 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=9, if we are at y=1, we can go down.\n\nBut y=1 at T=9 is on freeway, but T=9 safe, so ok.\n\nThen at T=10, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=11, stay at y=0.\n\nThen at T=12, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we start going up.\n\nT=12 y=0, T=13 y=1, ..., T=21 y=9, reach at T=21, late.\n\nBut at T=12, we can go up faster, but still slow.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be higher at T=12.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=9, we are at y=6.\n\nBut from y=6, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=10, all on freeway, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot stay high; we must be low at T=10 and 11.\n\nSo the best is to be at y=0 at T=10 and T=11, and then go up from T=11 or T=12.\n\nBut from T=11 y=0, go up: T=11 y=0, T=12 y=1, T=13 y=2, T=14 y=3, T=15 y=4, T=16 y=5, T=17 y=6, T=18 y=7, T=19 y=8, T=20 y=9.\n\nReach at T=20.\n\nBut at T=19, y=8, row 8, and T=19, is it safe? We need to check if T=19 is safe for row 8.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFirst, the unsafe times were only T=3,4,5,10,11 for specific rows, but for later times, it should be safe, but let's verify.\n\nFor example, for row 1, cars: car A covered 0 at T=10,11 only.\n\nCar B at T=3 only.\n\nFor T>11, car A: left(T) = -53 +6*(T-3), for T=19, ΔT=16, left= -53+96=43>0, right= -42+96=54>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nCar B: left(T) = -5 +6*(T-3), for T=19, ΔT=16, left= -5+96=91>0, not cover.\n\nSo for row 1, safe for T>11.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-8, car A same, car C covered at T=4,5, car D never, so for T>5, safe except T=10,11.\n\nT=12 and later safe.\n\nSo at T=19, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut reaching at T=20 is late.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=12, if we can be at y=8, then T=13 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=12, we need to be at y=7,8,9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, we must be at y=0, not on freeway, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, any attempt to be high at T=12 requires being on freeway at T=11, which is unsafe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=8 is T=12, but at T=12 we can be at y=8, then T=13 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=12, we need to have crossed the rows before, and at T=11, we must be at y=7 or 8, which is on freeway, unsafe.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at T=11, but impossible.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid the collision at T=11 if we want to reach early.\n\nTherefore, we must reach later than T=12.\n\nNext possible: reach at T=13 with y=9.\n\nAt T=13, y=9.\n\nAt T=12, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=8, row 8, T=12 safe, so ok.\n\nAt T=11, we must not be on freeway, so y=0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly T=10, y=0 or 9.\n\ny=9 not possible, so at T=10 and T=11, y=0.\n\nAt T=11, y=0.\n\nAt T=12, we need to be at y=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=11, at T=12 we can be at y=0 or 1, not y=8.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly for T=14 reach.\n\nAt T=14, y=9.\n\nAt T=13, at y=8 or 9.\n\nT=13 safe.\n\nAt T=12, at y=7,8,9 to reach y=8 or9 at T=13.\n\nT=12 safe.\n\nAt T=11, must be y=0 or9, so y=0.\n\nAt T=11, y=0.\n\nAt T=12, we can be at y=1 (if action U from y=0).\n\nThen at T=13, we can be at y=2, not y=8.\n\nStill not high enough.\n\nTo be at high y at T=12, we need to have been high before T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=9, be at y=6 as before.\n\nThen at T=9, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be high at T=10.\n\nThe only way is to be low at T=10 and 11, and then climb after.\n\nThe minimal reach turn is T=20 with the path I had.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by crossing some rows during the safe times before T=10.\n\nFor example, cross rows 1-4 at T=4 to T=7, which are safe.\n\nT=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow at T=7, y=4.\n\nInstead of going to y=5, we can stay or go down, but we need to cross rows 5-8 later.\n\nRows 5-8 are safe at T=6,7,8,9.\n\nAt T=7, we are at y=4.\n\nIf we go to y=5 at T=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=9, safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=6.\n\nThen we need to go down to y=0 for T=10.\n\nBut from y=6, we can go down to y=5 at T=10, but unsafe, or we can go down earlier.\n\nFrom T=9 y=6, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo we must be lower at T=9.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=5, we can go down to y=4 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action D to y=3 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, row 3, but T=10 unsafe for row 3, collision.\n\nAction S to y=4 at T=10, row 4, unsafe.\n\nAction U to y=5 at T=10, row 5, unsafe.\n\nAll collision at T=10.\n\nIf at T=8, we are at y=4, then at T=8 action D to y=3 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nThen at T=9 action D to y=2 at T=10, row 2, unsafe.\n\nStill collision.\n\nTo be at y=1 at T=9, then action D to y=0 at T=10.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=1 at T=4, then stay or go down.\n\nBut let's list a path that works.\n\nSuppose we do the following:\n\nT=3: y=0, action S (stay) or U, but let's see.\n\nTo be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nAt T=3: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=1, action S to stay at y=1 for T=5\n\nBut at T=5, y=1, row 1, safe? T=5 safe for row 1.\n\nSimilarly, we can stay at y=1 for multiple turns.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at T=9, we can stay from T=4 to T=9 at y=1.\n\nT=4 y=1, action S at T=4, to y=1 at T=5\n\nAction S at T=5, to y=1 at T=6\n\n...\nUp to action S at T=8, to y=1 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, y=1, action D to y=0 at T=10\n\nAt T=10, y=0, safe\n\nThen at T=10, action S to y=0 at T=11\n\nAt T=11, y=0, safe\n\nThen at T=11, action U to y=1 at T=12\n\nThen from there go up to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut we have wasted many turns staying at y=1.\n\nWe can go higher before staying.\n\nFor example, go up to y=4 by T=7: T=3 y=0 U, T=4 y=1 U, T=5 y=2 U, T=6 y=3 U, T=7 y=4\n\nThen at T=7, action D to y=3 at T=8\n\nT=8, y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9\n\nT=9, y=2, action D to y=1 at T=10? But at T=10, if y=1, unsafe.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, action D to y=1 at T=10, collision.\n\nAt T=9, action U to y=3 at T=10, collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt T=9, we need to be at y=1 or 0.\n\nSo from T=7 y=4, action D to y=3 at T=8\n\nT=8 y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9 y=2, we can only go to y=1,2,3 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nSo let's be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nHow to get there with fewer turns.\n\nFrom T=3 y=0, action U to y=1 at T=4\n\nThen from T=4 to T=9, stay at y=1 with actions S.\n\nT=4: action S, to y=1 at T=5\n\nT=5: action S, to y=1 at T=6\n\nT=6: action S, to y=1 at T=7\n\nT=7: action S, to y=1 at T=8\n\nT=8: action S, to y=1 at T=9\n\nThen T=9: action D to y=0 at T=10\n\nT=10: action S to y=0 at T=11 (or D, same)\n\nT=11: action U to y=1 at T=12\n\nThen T=12: action U to y=2 at T=13\n\nT=13: U to y=3\n\nT=14: U to y=4\n\nT=15: U to y=5\n\nT=16: U to y=6\n\nT=17: U to y=7\n\nT=18: U to y=8\n\nT=19: U to y=9\n\nReach at T=19.\n\nH number of turns: from T=3 to T=19, that's 17 turns, but H is the number of actions.\n\nPosition at T=19, so actions from T=3 to T=18, 16 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt T=9, we are at y=1, but we could be higher earlier and come down to y=1 at T=9.\n\nFor example, go up to y=8 quickly, but then come down.\n\nBut coming down takes time.\n\nFor example, from T=3 to T=10: but T=10 we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nSuppose we go up fast to y=8.\n\nMinimal to y=8: from y=0 at T=3, to y=8 at T=11 with 8 up moves: T=3 y=0, T=4 y=1, ..., T=11 y=8.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8, unsafe.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nGo to y=8 at T=9: T=3 y=0, T=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4, T=8 y=5, T=9 y=6, not y=8.\n\nTo y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen from y=6 at T=9, to go to y=1 at T=9 is impossible; we are at y=6 at T=9.\n\nTo be at y=1 at T=9, we need to be at y=1 at that turn.\n\nSo the only way is to not go high before T=9.\n\nThus, the path above with reaching at T=19 is one way.\n\nBut we can start going up after T=3 immediately to y=1, but then stay, so we cross row 1 at T=4, which is safe, and stay there, so we are on row 1 from T=4 to T=9, but T=4 to T=9 are all safe for row 1, except T=10 and 11, but we leave before.\n\nT=4,5,6,7,8,9 all safe for row 1, so staying at y=1 is fine.\n\nThen at T=9, go down to y=0 at T=10.\n\nThen stay at y=0 for T=11.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to reach faster, from T=11 y=0, we can go up continuously to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut the time from T=11 to T=20 is 9 turns to go up 8 levels? T=11 y=0, T=12 y=1, T=13 y=2, T=14 y=3, T=15 y=4, T=16 y=5, T=17 y=6, T=18 y=7, T=19 y=8, T=20 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTotal from T=3 to T=20, 18 turns for position, actions from T=3 to T=19.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t1 to when we reach, including start, so H such that at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nt1=3, at T=20 y=9, so 3+H-1=20, H-1=17, H=18.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=3+17=20? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn when position is at 9: T=20.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 =20, t1=3, so 3 + H -1 =20, 2+H=20, H=18.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_3 to a_{3+17} = a_3 to a_20? Indices.\n\nActions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nAfter applying these H actions, we have position at t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nWith actions from t1 to t1+H-2, we set position at t1+H-1.\n\nThen a_{t1+H-1} is applied, setting position at t1+H, but we don't care.\n\nFor the sequence, we include a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn this case, for position at T=20, we need t1+H-1=20, H-1=17, H=18.\n\nActions a_3 to a_{20}, but a_3 to a_20 is 18 actions? t from 0 to 17, a_{3+0} to a_{3+17} = a_3 to a_20, 18 actions.\n\nPosition after a_20 is at T=21, but we are at position at T=20 before a_20.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn t1, y_{t1} given.\n\nApply a_{t1}, get y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nApply a_{t1 + H-1}, get y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nTo have that, with the actions, we need that after applying a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2}, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen we apply a_{t1 + H-1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but it can be anything.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nFor our path, at T=20, y=9.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 =20, 3 + H -1 =20, H-1=17, H=18.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=20, but actions a_3 to a_20 set y_4 to y_21.\n\nWe need y_20=9.\n\nSo with actions from a_3 to a_19, we set y_4 to y_20.\n\nSpecifically, a_3 sets y_4, a_4 sets y_5, ..., a_19 sets y_20.\n\nThen at turn 20, we are at y_20=9.\n\nThen we apply a_20, which sets y_21, but for the sequence, we include it.\n\nIn the path, we can have a_20 = S or U or D, but at y=9, action D to y=8 or something, but we can choose S to stay.\n\nBut in this case, for the minimal path, we can have fewer actions if we go faster after T=11.\n\nBut in our case, from T=11 to T=20, it takes 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=9 with 8 up moves, but we can do it in 9 turns: from y=0 at T=11 to y=9 at T=20, 9 turns, 8 up moves and one extra, but since we start at y=0, to y=1 at T=12, etc, up to y=9 at T=20, it's 9 steps, 8 increases.\n\nNumber of turns from T=11 to T=20 is 10 turns for position, but actions from T=11 to T=19.\n\nPosition at T=11: y=0\n\nAfter a_11: y_12\n\n...\nAfter a_19: y_20=9\n\nSo actions from T=11 to T=19 to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 actions.\n\nBut we have actions before.\n\nIn the path I described, from T=3 to T=9, we are at y=1 from T=4 to T=9 with actions.\n\nLet's list the position and actions.\n\nT=3: y=0, action U to go to y=1 at T=4  (so a_3 = U)\n\nT=4: y=1, action S to stay at y=1 for T=5  (a_4 = S)\n\nT=5: y=1, action S to stay for T=6  (a_5 = S)\n\nT=6: y=1, action S to stay for T=7  (a_6 = S)\n\nT=7: y=1, action S to stay for T=8  (a_7 = S)\n\nT=8: y=1, action S to stay for T=9  (a_8 = S)\n\nT=9: y=1, action D to go to y=0 at T=10  (a_9 = D)\n\nT=10: y=0, action S to stay at y=0 for T=11  (a_10 = S)  (or D, same)\n\nT=11: y=0, action U to go to y=1 at T=12  (a_11 = U)\n\nT=12: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=13  (a_12 = U)\n\nT=13: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=14  (a_13 = U)\n\nT=14: y=3, action U to y=4 at T=15  (a_14 = U)\n\nT=15: y=4, action U to y=5 at T=16  (a_15 = U)\n\nT=16: y=5, action U to y=6 at T=17  (a_16 = U)\n\nT=17: y=6, action U to y=7 at T=18  (a_17 = U)\n\nT=18: y=7, action U to y=8 at T=19  (a_18 = U)\n\nT=19: y=8, action U to y=9 at T=20  (a_19 = U)\n\nAt T=20, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from a_3 to a_19, that's 17 actions? T=3 to T=19, 17 actions.\n\nH such that at turn t1+H-1=20, so 3+H-1=20, H-1=17, H=18, so actions from t=0 to 17, a_{3+0} to a_{3+17} = a_3 to a_20.\n\nIn the above, I have a_3 to a_19, missing a_20.\n\nAt T=19, y=8, action U to y=9 at T=20, so a_19 = U.\n\nThen at T=20, y=9, we apply a_20, which can be S, for example, to stay at y=9 for T=21.\n\nBut since we have reached at T=20, we include a_20 in the sequence, with arbitrary action, say S.\n\nSo actions: a_3 to a_20.\n\na_3 U, a_4 S, a_5 S, a_6 S, a_7 S, a_8 S, a_9 D, a_10 S, a_11 U, a_12 U, a_13 U, a_14 U, a_15 U, a_16 U, a_17 U, a_18 U, a_19 U, a_20 S\n\nPosition at T=20 is 9.\n\nNumber of actions: 18 actions for H=18.\n\nBut we can reduce the time by not staying so long at y=1.\n\nFor example, we can go higher before T=9 and come down to y=1 at T=9.\n\nBut coming down takes turns.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=4 by T=7: a_3 U to y=1 at T=4, a_4 U to y=2 at T=5, a_5 U to y=3 at T=6, a_6 U to y=4 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=4, action D to y=3 at T=8 (a_7 D)\n\nT=8, y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9 (a_8 D)\n\nT=9, y=2, but we need to be at y=1 at T=9 for going down to y=0 at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, action D to y=1 at T=10? But at T=10, y=1, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, we can only go to y=1,2,3 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at T=9; we must be at y=0 or y=1 at T=9 to be at y=0 at T=10.\n\nSo the only choices are to be at y=0 or y=1 at T=9.\n\nTo minimize time, we should be at y=1 at T=9, so that we can go down to y=0 at T=10.\n\nAnd to reach y=1 at T=9, we can arrive early and stay, or arrive late.\n\nThe earliest to be at y=1 is T=4, so staying from T=4 to T=9 is 6 turns at y=1, which is inefficient, but we can arrive later at y=1.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 longer, then go to y=1 at T=9.\n\nT=3 y=0, action S at T=3 to y=0 at T=4\n\naction S at T=4 to y=0 at T=5\n\n...\n\nup to action S at T=8 to y=0 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, y=0, action S to y=0 at T=10 (a_9 S)\n\nThen at T=10, y=0, action S to y=0 at T=11\n\nThen at T=11, y=0, action U to y=1 at T=12\n\nThen go up to y=9 at T=20.\n\nSame as before, but we stayed at y=0 instead of y=1, so we cross row 1 later.\n\nBut still reach at T=20.\n\nWith staying at y=1, we cross row 1 at T=4, which is fine.\n\nIn terms of turn count, same.\n\nBut we can go up to other rows during the early safe times.\n\nFor example, we can cross rows 2,3,4 before T=9.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, action U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, now instead of going up, we need to go down to be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nSo at T=7, action D to y=3 at T=8 (a_7 D)\n\nT=8: y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9 (a_8 D)\n\nT=9: y=2, but we need y=1 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=2, we can action D to y=1 at T=10, but T=10 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom T=8 y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9, then at T=9 action D to y=1 at T=10, collision.\n\nSo to be at y=1 at T=9, we must have action at T=8 that sets y=1 at T=9.\n\nAt T=8, if we are at y=1, action S to y=1 at T=9.\n\nOr at y=2, action D to y=1 at T=9.\n\nOr at y=0, action U to y=1 at T=9.\n\nSo at T=8, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nTo be at y=1 at T=9, at T=8 we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo minimize, we can be at y=2 at T=8, then action D to y=1 at T=9.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: y=0, a U to y=1 T=4\n\nT=4: y=1, a U to y=2 T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, a U to y=3 T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, a U to y=4 T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, a D to y=3 T=8  (since to be at lower level)\n\na_7 D\n\nT=8: y=3, a D to y=2 T=9  a_8 D\n\nT=9: y=2, a D to y=1 T=10? But we need to be at y=1 at T=9 for the position.\n\nAt T=9, position is y=2, not y=1.\n\nWe need position at T=9 to be y=1.\n\nSo at T=9, y=1.\n\nWith the above, at T=9, y=2.\n\nSo we can at T=8, from y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9, but we want y=1.\n\nAt T=8, we need to be at y=1 or y=2 or y=0.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y=4, action D to y=3 at T=8\n\nThen at T=8, y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9  (not y=1)\n\nTo get to y=1 at T=9, from y=3 at T=8, we can action D to y=2 at T=9, not lower.\n\nSo we can only get to y=2 at T=9 from y=3 at T=8.\n\nTo be at y=1 at T=9, at T=8 we must be at y=1 (action S) or y=2 (action D) or y=0 (action U).\n\nSo for example, at T=8, be at y=2, then action D to y=1 at T=9.\n\nHow to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nFrom start, T=3 y=0 U to T=4 y=1 U to T=5 y=2\n\nThen stay or something.\n\nT=5: y=2, action S to y=2 at T=6\n\naction S at T=6 to y=2 at T=7\n\naction S at T=7 to y=2 at T=8\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, action D to y=1 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=1, action D to y=0 at T=10\n\n etc.\n\nThen from T=5 to T=8, we stayed at y=2 for 4 turns.\n\nThen go down to y=1 at T=9, then to y=0 at T=10.\n\nThen from T=11 y=0, go up to y=9 at T=20.\n\nStill reach at T=20, same as before.\n\nBut we crossed rows 1 and 2 early.\n\nNo reduction in time.\n\nSo minimal H is 18, with reach at T=20.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at T=19.\n\nIf at T=19 y=9.\n\nThen at T=18, y=8 or9.\n\nT=18 safe.\n\nAt T=17, y=7,8,9\n\netc.\n\nAt T=11, must be y=0.\n\nAt T=11 y=0.\n\nThen T=12 y=1, T=13 y=2, T=14 y=3, T=15 y=4, T=16 y=5, T=17 y=6, T=18 y=7, T=19 y=8, not y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=19, at T=18 we must be at y=8 or9.\n\nAt T=18, y=8, for example.\n\nThen from T=11 y=0, to T=18 y=8, in 7 turns, we can go up 7 steps, to y=7 at T=18? T=11 y=0, T=12 y=1, T=13 y=2, T=14 y=3, T=15 y=4, T=16 y=5, T=17 y=6, T=18 y=7, so y=7 at T=18, then to y=8 at T=19, not y=9.\n\nSo to y=7 at T=18, then T=19 y=8, T=20 y=9.\n\nCannot reach at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, T=19 is impossible to reach y=9 from y=0 at T=11 in 8 turns? From T=11 to T=19 is 8 turns position, 7 actions? Positions from T=11 to T=19, 9 positions, 8 changes.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=11 to y=9 at T=20, 9 changes.\n\nSo minimal reach is T=20 with H=18.\n\nBut in the path, we can have a shorter sequence if we go up during the early safe times for higher rows, but since we have to be low at T=10 and 11, it doesn't help for the final ascent.\n\nSo I think H=18 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's output the sequence.\n\nTo save some actions, we can cross some rows early.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, action U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, action S to stay at y=4 for T=8? But we need to go down.\n\nAt T=7, action D to y=3 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=3, action D to y=2 at T=9\n\nBut at T=9, we want y=1, so from y=3 at T=8, action D to y=2 at T=9, not y=1.\n\nSo at T=9, y=2.\n\nThen to get to y=1 at T=9, not possible from here.\n\nAt T=8, if we are at y=2, action D to y=1 at T=9.\n\nSo from T=7, we need to be at y=2 at T=8.\n\nT=7: y=4, action D to y=3 at T=8\n\nNot y=2.\n\nTo be at y=2 at T=8, at T=7 we must be at y=1,2,3.\n\nFor example, at T=7, be at y=2.\n\nThen action D to y=1 at T=8? No, to be at y=2 at T=8, at T=7 be at y=2 and action S, or y=1 action U, or y=3 action D.\n\nSo for example, have y=2 at T=7, then action S to y=2 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, action D to y=1 at T=9.\n\nT=9: y=1, action D to y=0 at T=10\n\nThen etc.\n\nBut to have y=2 at T=7, from start: T=3 U to T=4 y=1 U to T=5 y=2\n\nThen at T=5 y=2, action S to T=6 y=2\n\nAction S to T=7 y=2\n\nThen T=7 action S to T=8 y=2\n\nT=8 action D to T=9 y=1\n\nT=9 action D to T=10 y=0\n\nT=10 action S to T=11 y=0\n\nT=11 action U to T=12 y=1\n\nThen U each turn to T=20 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo I think it's the best.\n\nFor the sequence, we can start from T=3 with action.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=3 to t=20 for H=18.\n\nBut to write the actions.\n\nSince the cars are the same for all freeways, and the bad times are global, the minimal H is 18.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at T=12 by being at y=9 at T=12, but with T=11 at y=0, impossible, so no.\n\nPerhaps for rows 5-8, they are safe at T=3, but we are not on them.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think we have to accept H=18.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeways 5-8, there is a car at (30,19,right,6), which at T=3, span [19,30], so 0 not covered, and it moves right, so for later T, it is farther right, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nSo no other constraints.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 18.\n\nNow for the sequence, let's write the actions from turn 3.\n\nTo have a shorter sequence, but I think not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at T=12 by being on y=9 at T=11, impossible.\n\nOr, since at T=12 we can be at y=8, then to y=9 at T=13, but at T=11 we need to be at y=0, cannot jump.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the action sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U  (to y=2 at T=5)\n\nIn the first path I had staying at y=1, but we can have different.\n\nTo make it simple, let's do the following sequence:\n\n- At turn 3: U, go to y=1 at T=4\n\n- Turn 4: U, go to y=2 at T=5\n\n- Turn 5: U, go to y=3 at T=6\n\n- Turn 6: U, go to y=4 at T=7\n\n- Turn 7: D, go to y=3 at T=8\n\n- Turn 8: D, go to y=2 at T=9\n\n- Turn 9: D, go to y=1 at T=10? No, at T=9 we are at y=2, action D to y=1 at T=10, but T=10 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nWith the stay at y=2:\n\nTurn 3: U  (y=1 at T=4)\n\nTurn 4: U  (y=2 at T=5)\n\nTurn 5: S  (y=2 at T=6)\n\nTurn 6: S  (y=2 at T=7)\n\nTurn 7: S  (y=2 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: D  (y=1 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: D  (y=0 at T=10)\n\nTurn 10: S  (y=0 at T=11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (y=1 at T=12)\n\nTurn 12: U  (y=2 at T=13)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y=3 at T=14)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y=4 at T=15)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y=5 at T=16)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y=6 at T=17)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y=7 at T=18)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y=8 at T=19)\n\nTurn 19: U  (y=9 at T=20)\n\nThen for turn 20: action, say S to stay at y=9 for T=21.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include up to turn 20 action.\n\nH=18, actions from t=3 to t=3+17=20? t from 0 to 17, a_{3+0} to a_{3+17}=a_3 to a_20.\n\na_3 to a_19 are above, a_20 not, so a_20 can be S.\n\nPosition at T=20 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 20, we have action a_20, which is after position at T=20.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to list actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=18, t1=3, so turns 3 to 3+17=20.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from turn 3 to turn 19, we have actions, turn 20 missing.\n\nTurn 3 to turn 19 is 17 actions.\n\nH=18 requires 18 actions.\n\nSo for turn 20: a_20 = S\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nPositions: T=3 y=0, after a3 U, T=4 y=1; a4 U, T=5 y=2; a5 S, T=6 y=2; a6 S, T=7 y=2; a7 S, T=8 y=2; a8 D, T=9 y=1; a9 D, T=10 y=0; a10 S, T=11 y=0; a11 U, T=12 y=1; a12 U, T=13 y=2; ... up to a18 U, T=19 y=8; a19 U, T=20 y=9; a20 S, T=21 y=9.\n\nAt T=20, y=9, reached.\n\nAnd we avoided the bad times.\n\nH=18.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 18.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n  - All cars are moving right (since direction is \"right\" for every car) at speed 6.\n  - The car span for a right-moving car is [tau, h] initially, and at time T (>= t1) the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNote: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). The player updates at each turn: \n  - Action U: y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if not at 9)\n  - Action D: y_{t+1} = y_t - 1 (if not at 0)\n  - Action S: y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and then moves to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T+1. Therefore, at turn T, the player is only on one row (the starting row of the move) and will check the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions on the freeways (rows 1 to 8) during the entire journey.\n\nGiven the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n   car1: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> initial span [-35, -24] (since right-moving: tail=-35, head=-24)\n   car2: (24, 13, right, 6) -> initial span [13,24] (but note: the representation is (head, tail) but for right-moving the head is greater? Actually the problem says: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail to head, so if head is at 24 and tail at 13, then the car is from 13 to 24? But wait: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". In a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is at the right) and tail at the left. So the span should be [tail, head] = [13,24]. But note the first car: (-24, -35) -> tail=-35, head=-24, so span [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: three cars each:\n   car1: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24]\n   car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12]   [tail=1, head=12]\n   car3: (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48]\n\nBut wait: the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the head is the larger number and tail the smaller? But in the first car on freeway1: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so head is greater than tail? -24 > -35, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the initial spans (at t1=6) are:\n\nFreeway 1: [-35, -24] and [13,24]\nFreeway 2: same\nFreeway 3: same\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: [-35, -24], [1,12], [37,48]\nFreeway 6: same\nFreeway 7: same\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAt a future turn T (starting from t1=6), the cars move to the right by 6*(T-6) per unit time.\n\nSo at turn T, the car positions on a freeway are:\n\nFor a car with initial span [a, b] (at T=6), at turn T it becomes [a + 6*(T-6), b + 6*(T-6)].\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we step on at turn T, if the x-coordinate 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at turn 6. We must avoid rows 1 to 8 at the turns we are on them.\n\nGoal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=2 and need to go to y=9, we must go up at least 7 times. We can also go down, but that would increase the number of moves. So the minimal H is at least 7.\n\nBut we have to avoid the cars. We can also use S (stay) to wait for a car to pass.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nNote: The turn count: at turn 6 (current) we are at y=2. Then we take an action at turn 6 to determine y_7, then at turn 7 to determine y_8, etc.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn t1=6.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: a_6, a_7, a_8, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions.\n\nFirst, let's look at the freeways we will traverse: from y=2 to y=9, we will pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8. But note we might go down and then up, so we might traverse some rows multiple times.\n\nHowever, since we want minimal turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible without colliding.\n\nBut let's check the cars on the rows we must pass: rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nHowever, note that we start at row 2 at turn 6. Then we can move to row 3 at turn 7, then 4 at turn 8, etc.\n\nBut we must check for each row at the turn we are on it whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nWe are at row y at turn T if we are at position (0,y) at turn T.\n\nHow do we get to row 2 at turn 6? That's the start. Then:\n\n- If we choose U at turn 6, then at turn 7 we are at y=3.\n- If we choose D at turn 6, then at turn 7 we are at y=1 (but then we have to avoid row1? but note row1 is a freeway and we are at row1 at turn7, so we must check row1 at turn7).\n- If we choose S at turn6, then at turn7 we are still at y=2.\n\nWe must avoid row1? Actually, the problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So if we are on row1, we must check the cars on row1.\n\nBut note: the goal is to get to row9. Row9 is not a freeway? Actually, the freeways are only 1 to 8. So row0 and row9 are safe? The problem says: vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. And freeways are at y=1,...,8. So at row0 and row9, there are no cars. Therefore, we are safe at row0 and row9.\n\nSo if we go down to row1, that is a freeway and we must avoid the cars there. Similarly, row9 is safe.\n\nBut we start at row2 (which is a freeway) at turn6. So we must check row2 at turn6: is there a car on row2 at turn6 covering x=0?\n\nLet's check row2 at turn6: the cars on row2 are the same as freeway2: two cars: [-35,-24] and [13,24] at turn6.\n\n0 is not in [-35,-24] and not in [13,24]. So safe at turn6.\n\nNow, we want to go up. But let's check the next rows.\n\nWe need to see when the cars on the rows we are going to pass will be at x=0.\n\nFor a car on a row, the time when it covers x=0: we have an interval [a + 6*(T-6), b + 6*(T-6)] contains 0.\n\nSo: a + 6*(T-6) <= 0 <= b + 6*(T-6)\n\nBut note: the car moves continuously. However, we are only checking at integer turns.\n\nFor a car with initial [a,b] at T=6, then at turn T (>=6), the span is [a+6*(T-6), b+6*(T-6)].\n\nWe need 0 in that interval:\n\n   a + 6*(T-6) <= 0 <= b + 6*(T-6)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n   a + 6*(T-6) <= 0  => T-6 >= ceil(-a/6) ? Actually, we can write:\n\n   T >= 6 + ceil(-b/6) ? Let me rearrange:\n\n   a + 6*(T-6) <= 0  => 6*(T-6) <= -a  => T-6 <= -a/6  => T <= 6 - a/6\n\n   and\n\n   b + 6*(T-6) >= 0  => 6*(T-6) >= -b  => T-6 >= -b/6  => T >= 6 - b/6\n\nBut note: since the car is moving to the right, and a and b are the initial positions (at T=6) of the tail and head, and since the car moves at 6 per turn, the time when the car covers 0 is:\n\n   T must be an integer such that:\n        6 - b/6 <= T <= 6 - a/6\n\nBut note: since the car is moving to the right, the entire car must pass 0. The front (head) passes 0 at time: when head position = 0 -> b + 6*(T-6) = 0 -> T = 6 - b/6.\nThe tail passes 0 at time: a + 6*(T-6) = 0 -> T = 6 - a/6.\n\nBut note: the car covers 0 from the moment the front passes 0 until the tail passes 0? Actually, no: when the car is moving right, the front (head) is the first to hit 0 and the tail is the last to leave? Actually, no: the head is the front. So when the head is at 0, the car is just starting to cover 0? Actually, the car covers 0 from the moment the tail passes 0 to the moment the head passes 0? \n\nWait: the car is a segment [tail, head]. As it moves to the right, the segment moves to the right. The segment covers 0 when:\n\n   tail_position <= 0 <= head_position\n\nAt time T: tail_position = a + 6*(T-6), head_position = b + 6*(T-6)\n\nSo we require:\n   a + 6*(T-6) <= 0 <= b + 6*(T-6)\n\nSo T must satisfy:\n   T >= ceil( (6 - b/6) )? Actually, we can compute:\n\n   T_min = ceil( ( -b ) / 6 + 6 )? \n\nBut let's compute the exact real numbers and then the integer T for which the condition holds.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each car the interval of T (integer) during which 0 is in the car.\n\nFor a car with initial [a,b] at T=6, the condition is:\n\n   a + 6*(T-6) <= 0  => T <= 6 - a/6\n   b + 6*(T-6) >= 0  => T >= 6 - b/6\n\nSo T must be in [ceil(6 - b/6), floor(6 - a/6)]? \n\nBut note: the inequalities are inclusive. Since T is integer, we can compute:\n\n   T_min = ceil(6 - b/6)   [since T must be at least 6 - b/6, and T integer so we take the ceiling?]\n\n   Actually, the condition T >= 6 - b/6 and T <= 6 - a/6.\n\nBut note: 6 - b/6 and 6 - a/6 might not be integers.\n\nSo the integer T must satisfy:\n   T_min = floor(6 - b/6) + 1? \n\nWait, let me do an example.\n\nConsider a car on freeway2: [13,24] at T=6.\n\nThen the condition for T: \n   T >= 6 - 24/6 = 6 - 4 = 2\n   T <= 6 - 13/6 = 6 - 2.166... = 3.833...\n\nSo T must be an integer in [2, 3.833...], so T=2,3.\n\nBut wait: at T=2, which is before the current turn (T=6), that doesn't matter because we are starting at T=6. So we only care about T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, the other car [-35,-24]: \n   T >= 6 - (-24)/6 = 6 + 4 = 10\n   T <= 6 - (-35)/6 = 6 + 35/6 = 6 + 5.833... = 11.833...\n\nSo T=10,11.\n\nNow for freeways 5-8, we have three cars per freeway. Let's list the dangerous times for each car per freeway.\n\nWe are only concerned with T>=6.\n\nFor freeway1,2,3,4 (same for each):\n\n   Car1: [-35,-24] -> dangerous at T=10,11 (as above)\n   Car2: [13,24] -> dangerous at T=2,3 (but T=2,3 are before 6, so not dangerous for T>=6.\n\nSo freeways 1-4 are safe at all T>=6? Because the second car [13,24] is dangerous only at T=2,3 and the first car is dangerous at T=10,11. But what about in between? For example, at T=6,7,8,9: both cars are not covering 0? \n\nAt T=6:\n   Car1: [-35+0, -24+0] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n   Car2: [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt T=7: \n   Car1: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n   Car2: [13+6,24+6] = [19,30] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, T=8: \n   Car1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n   Car2: [13+12,24+12] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n\nT=9:\n   Car1: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in.\n   Car2: [13+18,24+18] = [31,42] -> 0 not in.\n\nT=10: \n   Car1: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n        Actually, -11<=0<=0 -> yes, so dangerous.\n   Car2: [13+24,24+24] = [37,48] -> no.\n\nT=11:\n   Car1: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n\nT=12:\n   Car1: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeways 1-4 are dangerous only at T=10 and T=11.\n\nNow for freeways 5-8: each has three cars.\n\n   Car1: [-35,-24] -> same as above: dangerous at T=10,11.\n   Car2: [1,12] -> at T=6: [1,12] -> 0 not included? because 1>0? \n        But let's compute the dangerous T for this car:\n\n        Condition: \n          T >= 6 - 12/6 = 6-2=4\n          T <= 6 - 1/6 = 6 - 0.166... = 5.833...\n\n        So T=4,5 -> before 6, so not dangerous for T>=6.\n\n        At T=6: [1+0,12+0] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        T=7: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> no.\n\n        So safe.\n\n   Car3: [37,48] -> \n        Condition:\n          T >= 6 - 48/6 = 6-8 = -2 -> always true for T>=6? \n          T <= 6 - 37/6 = 6 - 6.166... = -0.166... -> which is negative -> so no T satisfies? \n\n        Actually: \n          We require: 37 + 6*(T-6) <= 0 -> 37 <= 6*(6-T) -> which for T>=6, the right-hand side is <=0, but 37>0 -> never satisfied.\n\n        So car3 never covers 0? \n\n        Alternatively, at T=6: [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n        at T=7: [43,54] -> no.\n\n        So car3 is safe.\n\nTherefore, for freeways 5-8, the only dangerous car is the first one, which is dangerous at T=10,11.\n\nSo summary for all freeways 1 to 8: \n   They are safe at all turns T>=6 except T=10 and T=11.\n\nBut note: at T=10 and T=11, if we are on any freeway (y=1 to 8) we will collide? Actually, only if we are on a freeway that has a car at that time? But from above, every freeway 1-8 has at least one car (the one with initial [-35,-24]) that is dangerous at T=10 and T=11. So if we are on any freeway (1 to 8) at turn 10 or 11, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 1-8 at turns 10 and 11.\n\nSo the strategy: we need to be either at y=0 or y=9 at turns 10 and 11.\n\nBut note: we start at turn6 at y=2. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe have 4 turns (turn6,7,8,9) to get to y=9? Because if we get to y=9 by turn9, then at turn10 and 11 we are at y=9 (safe). Then we are done.\n\nBut can we get to y=9 in 7 moves? (from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves up) but that would take 7 moves: \n\n   At turn6: start at y=2, then \n   turn6: U -> y=3 at turn7\n   turn7: U -> y=4 at turn8\n   turn8: U -> y=5 at turn9\n   turn9: U -> y=6 at turn10 -> but at turn10 we are at y=6 (freeway) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do 4 U moves in a row because we would be at y=6 at turn10 (which is dangerous).\n\nAlternatively, we can try to get to y=9 earlier? \n\nBut we start at y=2 and we have only 3 moves from turn6 to turn9 (because after turn9, we are at the position that will be at turn10). \n\nWait: the moves:\n\n   At turn6: we take an action to determine y7.\n   At turn7: we take an action to determine y8.\n   At turn8: we take an action to determine y9.\n   At turn9: we take an action to determine y10.\n\nSo by the end of turn9, we have taken 4 actions. The minimal moves to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 moves? Actually, 7 moves of U. But we have only 4 actions? Then we cannot get to y=9 in 4 moves? We can only get to y=2 + 4 = 6 by turn10? \n\nBut note: at turn6, we are at y=2. Then:\n\n   After 1 move (turn6): y7 = 2 + (0 or 1 or -1) -> max 3.\n   After 2 moves: max 4.\n   After 3 moves: max 5.\n   After 4 moves: max 6.\n\nSo by turn10 (which is after 4 moves: at turn10 we have taken 4 actions, so we are at y10 = 2 + (number of U - number of D) in 4 moves. The maximum we can get is 2+4=6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 by turn10.\n\nSo we must avoid the dangerous turns 10 and 11 by being at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn10? Then we are in danger. So we must not be on freeways at turn10 and 11.\n\nWe have two options:\n\nOption 1: be at y=0 at turn10 and 11.\nOption 2: be at y=9 at turn10 and 11.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn6. We can try to go down to y=0 and then wait until the danger is over, then go up.\n\nBut going down: from y=2 to y=0: 2 moves down. Then we can wait at y=0 for a few turns, then go up to y=9.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the freeways at turn10 and 11. So we must be at y=0 at turn10 and 11.\n\nThen we can start going up at turn12.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to get to y=9 as quickly as possible but after the danger.\n\nBut we cannot get to y=9 by turn9 (as shown: we can only get to y=6 at turn10). So we have to wait until at least turn12 to start going up? \n\nBut note: we can be at y=0 at turn10 and 11, then at turn12 we can start moving up. \n\nHow long does it take to get to y=9 from y=0? 9 moves of U. \n\nBut we can start at turn12 at y=0, then:\n\n   turn12: U -> y=1 at turn13\n   turn13: U -> y=2 at turn14\n   turn14: U -> y=3 at turn15\n   turn15: U -> y=4 at turn16\n   turn16: U -> y=5 at turn17\n   turn17: U -> y=6 at turn18\n   turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n   turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n   turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn21.\n\nBut we started at turn6. So total turns: 21-6+1 = 16 moves? Actually, the actions are from turn6 to turn20 (15 actions) and we end at turn21.\n\nBut we can try to be at a higher row than 0 at the danger turns? But we cannot be on freeways at turns 10 and 11. The only safe rows are 0 and 9.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn6. We can go up to y=9? But we can only get to y=6 by turn10 (if we go up every time). Then we are in danger at turn10 and 11.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to y=0 by turn8? \n\nLet me plan:\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn10 and 11. \n\nWe start at turn6 at y=2.\n\nWe have 4 moves (turn6,7,8,9) to get to y=0 at turn10? Actually, at turn10 we are at the position determined by the actions taken at turn6 to turn9.\n\nBut note: the position at turn10 is determined after 4 actions (turn6,7,8,9). We start at y=2 at turn6.\n\nWe want y10 = 0.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   turn6: D -> y7 = 1\n   turn7: D -> y8 = 0\n   turn8: S -> y9 = 0\n   turn9: S -> y10 = 0\n\nThen we are at y=0 at turn10.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=0 (safe).\nAt turn11: we must also be safe. So we can do:\n   turn10: S -> y11 = 0 (safe) \n   turn11: S -> y12 = 0\n\nBut then at turn12, we can start moving up.\n\nBut wait, we don't have to wait until turn12 to start moving? We can move at turn10? But at turn10 we are at y=0. If we move up at turn10, then at turn11 we are at y=1. But at turn11, we must not be on a freeway? So that would be dangerous.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 at turn10 and turn11.\n\nTherefore:\n\n   turn10: S -> y11 = 0\n   turn11: S -> y12 = 0\n\nThen at turn12, we can start going up.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier? Actually, we can start going up at turn9? \n\nBut at turn9, we are at y=0 (if we did the above). Then:\n\n   turn9: U -> y10 = 1 -> but then at turn10 we are at y=1 -> collision.\n\nSo we must not move up until after turn11.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n\n   From turn6 to turn9: get to y=0 and stay there until after turn11.\n\n   Then from turn12 onward: go up to y=9.\n\nHow many moves to go up from y=0 to y=9? 9 moves.\n\nSo the actions:\n\n   turn6: D -> y7=1\n   turn7: D -> y8=0\n   turn8: S -> y9=0\n   turn9: S -> y10=0\n   turn10: S -> y11=0\n   turn11: S -> y12=0\n   turn12: U -> y13=1\n   turn13: U -> y14=2\n   turn14: U -> y15=3\n   turn15: U -> y16=4\n   turn16: U -> y17=5\n   turn17: U -> y18=6\n   turn18: U -> y19=7\n   turn19: U -> y20=8\n   turn20: U -> y21=9\n\nTotal moves: from turn6 to turn20 -> 15 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could avoid going all the way down to 0. What if we go up to a safe row? But the only safe rows at turn10 and 11 are 0 and 9. We cannot reach 9 by turn10. So 0 is the only option.\n\nAlternatively, we could be at row9 at turn12? But we are at row0 at turn12. Then we need 9 moves to get to row9, so we get there at turn21.\n\nBut note: we are at row0 at turn12. Then we do 9 U moves: \n   turn12: U -> turn13: row1\n   turn13: U -> row2\n   ...\n   turn20: U -> row9 at turn21.\n\nTotal turns: 21 - 6 = 15 moves? Actually, the number of actions: from turn6 to turn20 (inclusive) is 15 actions.\n\nBut we might be able to start going up earlier? \n\nWhat if we do:\n\n   turn6: U -> y7=3\n   turn7: U -> y8=4\n   turn8: U -> y9=5\n   turn9: D -> y10=4   (so at turn10 we are at row4 -> collision? because at turn10 we are on a freeway -> collision)\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at row9 at turn10? But we can only get to row6 at turn10 (if we go up every time). \n\nBut we can delay the moves? We can do some S to wait at a safe row? But the only safe rows during turn10 and 11 are 0 and 9. So we must be at one of them.\n\nWe cannot get to row9 by turn10. Therefore, we must be at row0 at turn10 and 11.\n\nBut what if we go down and then up? \n\nFor example, go down to row0 quickly, then wait, then go up. That's what we did.\n\nIs there a way to be at a higher row than 0 but not on freeways? No, because the freeways are rows 1-8. So only 0 and 9 are safe.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to be at row9 at turn10? Then we are safe. But we start at row2 and we have 4 moves: we can only get to row6. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of moves is 15? But we can try to optimize the upward journey: we don't need to go all the way to 0? \n\nWait: we are at row2 at turn6. We need to be at row0 at turn10. We can do:\n\n   turn6: D -> row1 at turn7\n   turn7: D -> row0 at turn8\n   then we wait at row0 for turns 8,9,10,11: \n        turn8: S -> row0 at turn9\n        turn9: S -> row0 at turn10\n        turn10: S -> row0 at turn11\n        turn11: S -> row0 at turn12\n\nThen at turn12, we are at row0. Then we need 9 moves to get to row9: so we reach row9 at turn21.\n\nBut we started at turn6. The actions: turn6 to turn20: 15 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can start going up at turn9? But if we go up at turn9 from row0, then at turn10 we are at row1 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nBut note: we are required to avoid collisions at the turn we are on the freeway. At turn10 and turn11, we must not be on freeway. But at turn12, we can be on freeway? Yes, because the dangerous times are only 10 and 11.\n\nSo the upward journey: we can go as fast as possible from row0 at turn12 to row9. That takes 9 moves: 9 consecutive U moves.\n\nBut is there a way to reduce the total moves? \n\nWhat if we go up as much as possible without hitting the dangerous turns? For example, we go up to row5 by turn9? Then at turn9, we are at row5. Then we have to get to row0 by turn10? But we can't: we can only go down one row per turn. So from row5 at turn9, we do D at turn9 -> row4 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to row8 at turn9? But we can only get to row6 at turn10? \n\nWe start at row2 at turn6. To get to row8 at turn10? \n\n   turn6: U -> row3 at turn7\n   turn7: U -> row4 at turn8\n   turn8: U -> row5 at turn9\n   turn9: U -> row6 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nWe can't.\n\nSo the only safe option is to go down to 0 and wait.\n\nBut we might not need to go all the way to 0 at turn8. We could wait at row1 until turn9? But then at turn10 we have to be at row0. So we can do:\n\n   turn6: D -> row1 at turn7\n   turn7: S -> row1 at turn8\n   turn8: S -> row1 at turn9\n   turn9: D -> row0 at turn10 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at row0 -> safe.\nThen at turn11: we must be safe: we can do S -> row0 at turn11.\n\nThen at turn12: start going up.\n\nBut we have saved one move? Because we didn't go to row0 until turn10. Previously we went to row0 at turn8 and then waited two turns. Now we wait at row1 until turn9 and then go down to row0 at turn9 (which gives row0 at turn10).\n\nSo the actions:\n\n   turn6: D -> y7=1\n   turn7: S -> y8=1\n   turn8: S -> y9=1\n   turn9: D -> y10=0   [because at turn9 we are at row1, then D: y10 = 1-1=0]\n   turn10: S -> y11=0\n   turn11: S -> y12=0\n   then from turn12 to turn20: 9 U moves -> y21=9.\n\nTotal actions: from turn6 to turn20 -> 15 actions.\n\nBut wait: we did 15 actions? \n\n   turn6: D\n   turn7: S\n   turn8: S\n   turn9: D\n   turn10: S\n   turn11: S\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   ...\n   turn20: U\n\nThat's 15 actions (from turn6 to turn20 inclusive: 20-6+1=15). And we reach y=9 at turn21.\n\nBut is there a way to start going up earlier? \n\nAfter turn11, we are at row0. Then we do 9 U moves. We have to do 9 U moves to get to row9.\n\nAlternatively, we could have gone to row0 earlier and then started going up earlier? But we cannot because we must avoid turn10 and 11. We are at row0 at turn10 and 11, so we cannot leave row0 until turn12.\n\nBut note: at turn11 we are at row0. Then at turn11 we could move? \n\n   At turn11: we are at row0. We can do U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at row1.\n\nBut then we avoid the danger? The danger is only at turn10 and 11. At turn11, we are at row0 (if we do S at turn11) -> safe. But if we do U at turn11, then at turn11 we are still at row0? No: \n\n   The action at turn11: \n        If we do S: then y12 = 0 (so at turn12 we are at row0).\n        If we do U: then y12 = 0+1 = 1 (so at turn12 we are at row1).\n\nBut the collision condition is at the turn we are on the freeway. At turn11, we are at the position we were at the end of the previous action? \n\nRecall: \n   At turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we take action a_T to get to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y11. We must avoid being on freeway (1-8) at turn11. If we are at row0 at turn11, then safe. Then we take action a11: if we do U, then at turn12 we are at row1.\n\nBut the collision at turn11 is already avoided because we are at row0.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   turn11: U -> then at turn12 we are at row1.\n\nThen we can save one move? Because we start going up at turn11.\n\nBut then we will be at row1 at turn12. Then we need 8 more moves to get to row9:\n\n   turn11: U -> row1 at turn12\n   turn12: U -> row2 at turn13\n   ...\n   turn19: U -> row9 at turn20.\n\nSo we reach row9 at turn20.\n\nTotal moves: from turn6 to turn19 -> 14 moves.\n\nHow?\n\n   turn6: D -> to row1 at turn7\n   turn7: S -> row1 at turn8\n   turn8: S -> row1 at turn9\n   turn9: D -> row0 at turn10\n   turn10: S -> row0 at turn11\n   turn11: U -> row1 at turn12\n   turn12: U -> row2 at turn13\n   turn13: U -> row3 at turn14\n   turn14: U -> row4 at turn15\n   turn15: U -> row5 at turn16\n   turn16: U -> row6 at turn17\n   turn17: U -> row7 at turn18\n   turn18: U -> row8 at turn19\n   turn19: U -> row9 at turn20.\n\nThat's 14 actions: turn6 to turn19 (14 turns).\n\nBut wait: we must check the positions at every turn for collision.\n\nCheck:\n\n   turn6: at row2 -> safe (as initially)\n   turn7: at row1 -> freeway1. Check freeway1 at turn7: \n        Freeway1 at turn7: \n            car1: [-35 + 6*(7-6)= -29, -24+6=-18] -> [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n            car2: [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> [19,30] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n   turn8: at row1 -> freeway1 at turn8: \n            car1: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> 0 not in.\n            car2: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> 0 not in.

Then:\n\n   turn6: D -> to row1 (at turn7)\n   turn7: S -> row1 at turn8\n   turn8: S -> row1 at turn9\n   turn9: D -> row0 at turn10\n   turn10: S -> row0 at turn11\n   turn11: U -> row1 at turn12\n   turn12: U -> row2 at turn13\n   turn13: U -> row3 at turn14\n   turn14: U -> row4 at turn15\n   turn15: U -> row5 at turn16\n   turn16: U -> row6 at turn17\n   turn17: U -> row7 at turn18\n   turn18: U -> row8 at turn19\n   turn19: U -> row9 at turn20.\n\nSo we reach row9 at turn20.\n\nTotal actions: 14 (from turn6 to turn19).\n\nIs this minimal? \n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from row2 to row9 is 7. But we have to avoid the dangerous turns 10 and 11. We used 3 moves to go down to row0 (but we did: D, then two S, then D: that's 4 moves to get to row0 at turn10) and then 9 moves to go up? But we did 9 moves? Actually, we did 9 moves from turn11 to turn19: that's 9 moves? \n\nBut we went from row0 at turn11 to row9 at turn20: that's 9 moves? Actually, 9 moves: \n   turn11: U -> row1 at turn12\n   turn12: U -> row2 at turn13\n   ...\n   turn19: U -> row9 at turn20 -> that's 9 moves.\n\nBut we started at row2 at turn6 and ended at row9 at turn20. The moves:\n\n   Down: from row2 to row1 (1 down) and then later from row1 to row0 (1 down) -> total 2 downs.\n   Up: 9 ups.\n   S: 3 S (at turn7,8,10).\n\nTotal: 2+9+3=14.\n\nWe cannot do fewer than 14? Because we have to wait during the dangerous turns. We have to be at row0 at turn10 and 11. The earliest we can get to row0 is at turn8: \n   turn6: D -> row1 at turn7\n   turn7: D -> row0 at turn8.\n\nThen we wait at row0 until turn12? But we can leave at turn11? \n\nIf we do:\n\n   turn6: D -> row1 at turn7\n   turn7: D -> row0 at turn8\n   turn8: S -> row0 at turn9\n   turn9: S -> row0 at turn10\n   turn10: S -> row0 at turn11\n   turn11: U -> row1 at turn12\n   then 8 more U to row9: \n        turn12: U -> row2\n        turn13: U -> row3\n        ...\n        turn19: U -> row9 at turn20.\n\nTotal: 14 moves.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut in our previous plan we had 3 S and 2 D and 9 U -> 14 moves.\n\nWe can try to reduce the S moves? \n\nFor example, after getting to row0 at turn8, we wait until turn11? That's 3 S (at turn8,9,10). Then at turn11 we go U. But we have to be at row0 at turn10 and 11: so we must do S at turn10 to be at row0 at turn11? \n\nAlternatively, we can leave row0 at turn10? \n\n   If at turn10 we are at row0, then we do U at turn10: then at turn11 we are at row1. But turn11 is dangerous: we are at row1 -> collision.\n\nSo we must be at row0 at turn11. Therefore, we cannot leave row0 until turn12? \n\nBut at turn11 we can do an action: if we do S at turn11, we stay at row0 at turn12. Then we start going up at turn12.\n\nBut if we start going up at turn12, then we need 9 moves to get to row9: so we do 9 U from turn12 to turn20, reaching row9 at turn21. That would be 15 moves.\n\nBut we found a way to start going up at turn11: we do U at turn11 (while at row0) and then we are at row1 at turn12. Then we do 8 more U to get to row9 at turn20. \n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at row0. Then we do U at turn11: \n   This means: at turn11, we are at row0 (so safe) and then we move to row1 at turn12. \n   The collision at turn11 is avoided.\n\nSo the plan with 14 moves is valid.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nNow, write the actions:\n\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut wait: we have 14 actions? \n\n   Turn6: D\n   Turn7: S\n   Turn8: S\n   Turn9: D\n   Turn10: S\n   Turn11: U\n   Turn12: U\n   Turn13: U\n   Turn14: U\n   Turn15: U\n   Turn16: U\n   Turn17: U\n   Turn18: U\n   Turn19: U\n\nThat's 14 lines.\n\nWe end at turn20 at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and we should have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHere, t1 = 6, H = 14 (number of actions) so the last action is at turn 6+14-1 = 19. Then at turn20 (the next state) we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. Then the position after H actions is y_{t1+H}. \n\nWe have: \n   After the action at turn19 (which is the last action, t=13 in the sequence: because t=0 to 13 -> 14 actions) we have:\n        y_{20} = 9.\n\nSo it satisfies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut note: we must check if we can avoid collision at row1 at turn7,8,9? We already did: they were safe.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the freeway1 at turn7,8,9:\n\n   Freeway1 cars: \n      car1: initial [-35,-24] -> moves right at 6 per turn.\n      car2: [13,24] -> moves right at 6 per turn.\n\n   At turn7 (T=7): \n        car1: [-35+6*(1) = -29, -24+6=-18] -> [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> [19,30] -> 0 not in.\n\n   At turn8 (T=8):\n        car1: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> safe.\n\n   At turn9 (T=9):\n        car1: [-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [13+18=31,24+18=42] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAnd at turn10: we are at row0 -> safe.\nAt turn11: row0 -> safe.\nAt turn12: row1 -> freeway1 at turn12: \n        car1: [-35+6*6= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? (0 is not in [1,12]) -> safe.\n        car2: [13+36=49,24+36=60] -> safe.\n\nThen the rest are safe as we computed.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe and minimal.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 2) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on all freeways (1-8) are dangerous only at turns 10 and 11, as their positions cover x=0 at these turns. Therefore, the player must be at y=0 or y=9 during turns 10 and 11. Since reaching y=9 by turn 10 is impossible (maximum reachable y by turn 10 is 6), the strategy involves moving down to y=0 by turn 10, staying there during turns 10 and 11, and then moving up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal sequence of actions (14 turns) is:\n\n- **Turn 6:** Move down (D) to y=1 at turn 7. Safe, as freeway 1 at turn 7 has cars at [-29, -18] and [19, 30], not covering x=0.\n- **Turn 7:** Stay (S) at y=1 for turn 8. Safe, as freeway 1 at turn 8 has cars at [-23, -12] and [25, 36], not covering x=0.\n- **Turn 8:** Stay (S) at y=1 for turn 9. Safe, as freeway 1 at turn 9 has cars at [-17, -6] and [31, 42], not covering x=0.\n- **Turn 9:** Move down (D) to y=0 at turn 10. Safe, as y=0 is not a freeway.\n- **Turn 10:** Stay (S) at y=0 for turn 11. Safe.\n- **Turn 11:** Move up (U) to y=1 at turn 12. Safe, as freeway 1 at turn 12 has cars at [1, 12] and [49, 60], not covering x=0 (0 ∉ [1, 12]).\n- **Turns 12-19:** Move up (U) consecutively to reach y=9 at turn 20. Each intermediate freeway (y=1 to 8) is safe at the respective turns, as no car covers x=0 after turn 11.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in 14 actions, with y=9 achieved at turn 20.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: S \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) on turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction is given as \"right\" for all cars, which I think means they're moving to the right. But looking at the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the car state, direction is given as \"right\", and for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] with τ being tail and h head? No, let's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving cars, the initial span is given as (tail, head) or (head, tail)? In the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] meaning [tail, head] since it moves right.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which is [tail, head], so head is larger than tail for right-moving.\n\nIn the data, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for consistency, since direction is \"right\", and for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nCheck the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nIf head is -12 and tail is -23, since -12 > -23, so for right-moving, head is larger, so Span = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? No.\n\nSpan(t_1) for right-moving is given as [τ, h], meaning the tail is first, then head, so the car extends from tail to head, with head > tail.\n\nIn the data, for first car: head = -12, tail = -23. Since -12 > -23, head > tail, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]. Similarly, second car: head=36, tail=25, 36>25, so Span = [25,36].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h < τ, but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T), and collision if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when the player moves to a new row, they are not on that row until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, the player is on row y_T. If action a_T causes y_{T+1} to be different, then at turn T, player is still on y_T, and only checks cars on y_T for collision. At turn T+1, player is on y_{T+1}, checks cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on the current row.\n\nNow, t_1 = 8, player at (0,2).\n\nGoal: reach (0,9), which is row 9. Row 9 is not a freeway with cars; freeways are y=1 to 8, so row 9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, no cars, so only need to worry about collisions when on y=1 to 8.\n\nTo reach (0,9), since we start from y=2, and need to go to y=9, we need to move up 7 steps, but we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements.\n\nAll cars are right-moving with speed 6.\n\nt_1 = 8 is the current turn.\n\nFor any future turn T, relative time from t_1 is Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for right-moving car with initial τ, h.\n\ns = 6 for all cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have cars, and we need to know when 0 is in the span for that freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player moves one row per turn, we need to plan the sequence of actions to go from y=2 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a row when 0 is covered by a car on that row at that time.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each row.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): cars: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nFor first car: head=-12, tail=-23, so initial span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? No, as per update.\n\nFor right-moving: initial Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12] since τ=-23, h=-12.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=25, h=36, span [25,36].\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt] for each car.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 have same cars as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 2,3,4.\n\nThen freeway 5,6,7,8 have three cars each: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n(24,13,right,6) and (60,49,right,6), so head=24,tail=13 and head=60,tail=49.\n\nNow, for each row, we need to find when 0 is in the span of any car on that row.\n\nSince the spans move, we can find for each row the times when 0 is covered.\n\nA collision occurs at time T if for the row y_T, there exists a car such that 0 is in [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt] for that car, with Δt = T - t_1 = T - 8.\n\nLet δt = T - 8, so δt >=0.\n\nFor a given row and δt, 0 is covered if for some car, min(τ + 6δt, h + 6δt) <= 0 <= max(τ + 6δt, h + 6δt)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ + 6δt and h + 6δt, and since h > τ, the span is [τ + 6δt, h + 6δt], so 0 is in it if τ + 6δt <= 0 <= h + 6δt.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each car, we can solve for when τ + 6δt <= 0 <= h + 6δt.\n\nWhich is equivalent to 0 >= τ + 6δt and 0 <= h + 6δt, so -τ >= 6δt and -h <= 6δt? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + 6δt <= 0 <= h + 6δt\n\nFirst inequality: τ + 6δt <= 0 ⇒ 6δt <= -τ ⇒ δt <= -τ / 6\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= h + 6δt ⇒ 6δt >= -h ⇒ δt >= -h / 6\n\nSo for each car, 0 is in span when max( ceil(-h/6) , something) but δt must satisfy:\n\nδt >= ceil( -h / 6 ) ? Since δt integer, we need to find integer δt where δt >= ceil( -h / 6 ) and δt <= floor( -τ / 6 )\n\nFrom above:\n\nδt >= -h / 6  (since 6δt >= -h)\n\nδt <= -τ / 6  (since 6δt <= -τ)\n\nAnd since δt integer, the range is from ceil( -h / 6 ) to floor( -τ / 6 )\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom δt >= -h / 6 and δt <= -τ / 6\n\nSince -h/6 and -τ/6, and h and τ are integers, δt must be integer.\n\nSo lower bound L = ceil( -h / 6 )\n\nUpper bound U = floor( -τ / 6 )\n\nThen for δt from L to U inclusive, 0 is covered.\n\nBut we need to be careful with the inequalities.\n\nFor example, if -h/6 is integer, δt >= k if -h/6 = k, then δt >= k.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow for each row, we have multiple cars, so we need the union of these intervals for all cars on that row.\n\nThen, for a given row and δt, if there is any car covering 0, then that row is occupied at time δt.\n\nPlayer should not be on that row at that time.\n\nNow, since we start at δt=0, which is turn t_1=8.\n\nPlayer at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal H would be at least 7, since from 2 to 9, difference 7, so if no cars, we could go up 7 times in 7 turns.\n\nBut with cars, we may need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each row the times when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with row 1 (y=1).\n\nCars: car A: h=-12, τ=-23\n\ncar B: h=36, τ=25\n\nFor car A: h=-12, τ=-23\n\nCompute δt for coverage.\n\nFirst, δt >= ceil( -h / 6 ) = ceil( -(-12) / 6 ) = ceil(12/6) = ceil(2) = 2\n\nδt <= floor( -τ / 6 ) = floor( -(-23) / 6 ) = floor(23/6) = floor(3.833) = 3\n\nSo for car A, 0 covered when δt >=2 and δt <=3, so δt=2,3\n\nδt >= ceil( -h/6 ) = ceil(12/6)=2\n\nδt <= floor( -τ/6 ) = floor(23/6)= floor(3.833)=3\n\nYes, δt=2,3\n\nNow car B: h=36, τ=25\n\nδt >= ceil( -h/6 ) = ceil(-36/6) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nδt <= floor( -τ/6 ) = floor(-25/6) = floor(-4.166) = -5? Let's see.\n\n-τ/6 = -25/6 ≈ -4.166, floor is -5? Floor of -4.166 is -5, since floor is the greatest integer less than or equal, so -5 < -4.166 < -4, so floor is -5.\n\nBut δt = T - 8, and T >= t_1=8, so δt >=0, so we only care about δt >=0.\n\nδt >= ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-36/6) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nBut since δt >=0, the lower bound is max(ceil(-h/6), 0) but ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-6) = -6, so for δt >=0, δt >=0 > -6, so the inequality δt >= ceil(-h/6) is always true for δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound δt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-25/6) = floor(-4.166) = -5\n\nBut δt <= -5, and δt >=0, but 0 > -5, so δt <= -5 is impossible for δt>=0. So no coverage for car B at δt >=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nFor car B: δt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-25/6) = -5, which is less than 0, so for δt >=0, no solution, meaning 0 is never covered by car B for T >= t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1, only car A covers 0 at δt=2 and δt=3.\n\nδt=2: T = t_1 + 2 = 10\n\nδt=3: T=11\n\nSo row 1 is occupied at turns 10 and 11.\n\nNow row 2: same as row 1, since cars are identical: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, only car A covers at δt=2,3, so occupied at T=10,11.\n\nRow 3: same, occupied at T=10,11.\n\nRow 4: same, occupied at T=10,11.\n\nNow row 5: cars: A: (-12,-23,right,6), B: (24,13,right,6), C: (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst, car A: same as before, h=-12, τ=-23, covers at δt=2,3 (T=10,11)\n\nCar B: h=24, τ=13\n\nδt >= ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-24/6) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nδt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-13/6) = floor(-2.166) = -3? -2.166, floor is -3? -3 < -2.166 < -2, so floor is -3.\n\nBut δt >=0, so δt >= ceil(-h/6) = -4, which is true for δt>=0.\n\nδt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-13/6) = floor(-2.166) = -3\n\nSince δt <= -3 and δt >=0, impossible, so no coverage for car B.\n\nδt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-13/6) = -3, and -3 <0, so for δt >=0, no, so car B never covers 0 for T>=t_1.\n\nCar C: h=60, τ=49\n\nδt >= ceil(-h/6) = ceil(-60/6) = ceil(-10) = -10\n\nδt <= floor(-τ/6) = floor(-49/6) = floor(-8.166) = -9\n\nBoth bounds less than 0, so no coverage.\n\nThus for row 5, only car A covers at δt=2,3, so occupied at T=10,11.\n\nSimilarly, row 6,7,8: same cars as row 5: A, B, C with same parameters.\n\nFor row 6: cars (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nCar A: covers δt=2,3\n\nCar B: as above, no coverage\n\nCar C: no coverage\n\nSo occupied at T=10,11.\n\nSame for row 7 and 8.\n\nSo, all rows from 1 to 8 are occupied at exactly turns T=10 and T=11.\n\nThat is, at δt=2 and δt=3.\n\nAt other times, no car covers 0 on any row.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFor example, row 1 at δt=0: T=8\n\nFor car A: τ + 6*0 = -23, h + 6*0 = -12, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nCar B: τ+0=25, h+0=36, 0 not in [25,36]\n\nSimilarly, at δt=1: T=9\n\nCar A: [-23 +6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -6 <0\n\nCar B: [25+6,36+6]=[31,42], 0 not in\n\nAt δt=2: T=10\n\nCar A: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in [ -11,0]? -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at δt=3: T=11\n\nCar A: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]\n\nAt δt=4: T=12\n\nCar A: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, car B never.\n\nSame for other rows.\n\nFor rows 5-8, car A is the one covering, same as above.\n\nSo indeed, for all rows y=1 to 8, there is a car covering 0 at T=10 and T=11 only. At all other times, no car covers 0 on any row.\n\nTherefore, the only dangerous times are turn 10 and turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10 and 11, if the player is on any row from 1 to 8, there will be a collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t_1=8, position y=2.\n\nAt turn 8, player is on y=2. Since T=8, not 10 or 11, and as above, no car covers 0 at T=8 for any row, so it's safe to be on y=2 at turn 8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 up moves.\n\nBut at turn 10 and 11, we cannot be on rows 1-8.\n\nTurn 10 is δt=2, which is T=10.\n\nTurn 11 is T=11.\n\nNow, the player moves at each turn, starting from turn t_1=8.\n\nLet me denote the turns: let t be the turn number, starting from t=8.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at t=8, y_8=2.\n\nAction a_8 is chosen, then y_9 = y_8 + Δy, and so on.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=8 to some t=8+H-1 such that y_{8+H-1} =9, and for each turn from t=8 to t=8+H-2, no collision when on y_t.\n\nThe last turn is when we reach y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, no issue.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and 0 covered by car on row y_t at time t.\n\nFrom above, this happens only if t=10 or t=11.\n\nFor t=10 or t=11, if player is on y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at t=10 and t=11, player is not on rows 1-8.\n\nThat is, at turn 10, y_10 must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, y_11 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or y=9 are safe because no cars.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we have to avoid being on 1-8 at t=10 and t=11, we can be at y=0 or y=9 at those times.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if we can reach y=9 by t=10 or earlier, that would be good.\n\nMinimum time: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up.\n\nIf we go up every turn, starting t=8.\n\nAt t=8: y=2\n\nAction a_8=U, then y_9=3\n\na_9=U, y_10=4\n\nBut at t=10, y_10=4, which is between 1-8, and t=10 is dangerous, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up faster, we might be at higher y, but still on 1-8 at t=10.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up as fast as possible.\n\nt=8: y=2, action U, y9=3\n\nt=9: y=3, action U, y10=4 → at t=10, y=4, collision.\n\nIf we do nothing or down, worse.\n\nWe need to not be on 1-8 at t=10 and t=11.\n\nOne way is to be at y=0 or y=9 at those times.\n\nSince we start at y=2, going down to y=0 might take time.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nTo minimize H, we should try to reach y=9 as soon as possible, but avoid the danger times.\n\nThe danger times are fixed: t=10 and t=11.\n\nWe need to schedule the moves so that at t=10 and t=11, we are at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is goal, better to be there.\n\nBut we might not reach by t=10.\n\nCompute the earliest possible to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2, min 7 up moves, so at turn t=8+7=15, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut at t=10 and 11, if we are on the way, we might be on 1-8.\n\nSince we have to avoid t=10 and 11, we can be at safe positions then.\n\nNow, let's list the turns: t=8,9,10,11,12,...\n\nAt t=8: we are at y=2, safe since t=8 not danger.\n\nAction a_8: can be U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up, but need to manage position at t=10 and 11.\n\nSince t=10 and 11 are consecutive, we need to be at y=0 or 9 for both turns.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at t=10, then we can stay or move, but at t=11, if we move down, we might go to 8, which is dangerous at t=11, so better to stay or move up, but y=9 is max, so can only S or D, but D to 8 is bad at t=11.\n\nSo if at y=9 at t=10, we can S at t=10 to stay at y=9 for t=11? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=10, position y_10.\n\nAction a_10 determines y_11.\n\nIf y_10=9, then at t=10, we are on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThen a_10: if we S, y_11=9, safe.\n\nIf U, cannot, since y=9, probably U does nothing or invalid, but the update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U would make y=10, but y=10 not allowed, so probably U is invalid or capped, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U might be invalid or y stays 9, but to be safe, assume that U when at 9 keeps y=9 or error, but I think it's capped, so y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), so at y=9, U: y=9, D: y=8, S: y=9.\n\nSimilarly at y=0, U: y=1, D: y=0, S: y=0.\n\nBut in this case, if at t=10, y=9, we can S to stay at 9, or D to y=8, but at t=11, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nSo better to S.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=0 at t=10, we can S to stay at 0, or U to y=1, but at t=11, y=1 is dangerous, so better to S.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 or 9 at t=10 and also at t=11.\n\nSince t=10 and 11 are adjacent, if we are at y=0 at t=10, we can S to stay at 0 for t=11.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=9 at t=10, S to stay at 9.\n\nWe cannot move between t=10 and t=11 if we are at 0 or 9, because moving might put us at 1 or 8 at t=11, which is dangerous.\n\nFor example, if at y=0 at t=10, action U: y_11=1, then at t=11, y=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=9, action D: y_11=8, collision at t=11.\n\nTherefore, the only safe actions at t=10 if at 0 or 9 are to S, to stay at the same position for t=11.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at other positions at t=10, it's dangerous.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, we must have y_10 = 0 or 9, and then a_10 = S, so that y_11 = y_10.\n\nThus, we are safe at both turns.\n\nWe could have y_10 = 0 or 9, and y_11 = 0 or 9, but since actions change y by at most 1, if y_10=0, y_11 can be 0 or 1; if y_10=9, y_11=9 or 8; but y_11=1 or 8 is bad at t=11, so only possible to have y_11 same as y_10 if we S.\n\nThus, the only safe way is to be at y=0 or 9 at t=10 and stay there at t=11 with S.\n\nNow, we start from y=2 at t=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nNow, the danger times are only at t=10 and 11, so before and after, we can move freely except for the constraints.\n\nFrom t=8 to t=9, then to t=10.\n\nt=8: y=2\n\nWe need to get to a safe position at t=10.\n\nPossible safe positions at t=10: y=0 or y=9.\n\nNow, y=9: from y=2, to reach y=9 by t=10, we need to go up 7 times in 2 steps? From t=8 to t=10, we have actions at t=8 and t=9 to change y.\n\nAt t=8, action a_8, then y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nThen at t=9, action a_9, y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\ny_10 needs to be 0 or 9.\n\ny_8=2.\n\ny_10 = (y_8 + Δy_8) + Δy_9\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSo y_10 = 2 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_10 must be 0 or 9.\n\n2 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 = 0 or 9.\n\nSince |Δy| <=1, 2 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 <= 2+1+1=4 <9, so cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, 2 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 >= 2-1-1=0.\n\nCan be 0: if both Δy = -1, then y_10=2-1-1=0.\n\nIf one -1 and one 0, y_10=1, not 0 or 9.\n\nIf both 0, y_10=2.\n\nIf one +1 and one -1, y_10=2.\n\nIf both +1, y_10=4.\n\nSo possible y_10: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAmong these, only 0 is safe (y=9 not possible).\n\ny_10=0 is possible if we go down twice: a_8=D, y9=1; a9=D, y10=0.\n\nThen at t=10, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can a10=S, so y11=0, safe at t=11.\n\nThen after that, we need to go to y=9 from y=0.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=11, we can start going up.\n\nBut t=11 is done, now safe times.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves.\n\nBut we can do it gradually.\n\nWe need to minimize H, the number of turns from t=8 to when we reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, y=0; t=11, y=0; then from t=11, we go up to y=9.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9: from y=0, need 9 up moves.\n\nAfter t=11, which is turn 11, we can start from y=0 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, after action or position?\n\nAt turn t=11, position y_11=0 (from above).\n\nThen action a_11, which can be U, to y_12=1.\n\nThen a_12=U, y13=2, ..., up to y_20=9? Let's count.\n\ny_11=0\n\na_11=U, y12=1\n\na12=U, y13=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\na17=U, y18=7\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nSo at t=20, y=9.\n\nH = number of turns from t=8 to t=20 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: turns from t=8 to t=19? Actions from t=8 to t=19 for 12 actions? Define.\n\nStart at turn t=8, position given.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=8 + H, position after H actions.\n\nThe turn indices: after k actions, at turn t=8 + k.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe need y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9.\n\nFrom above, if we go down to y=0 at t=10, then up, we reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut t=20 is late.\n\nWe could be at y=9 at t=10, but we saw it's impossible from y=2 in 2 steps.\n\nAnother option: be at y=9 at t=11.\n\nt=11 is also a safe time if we are at 9.\n\ny_11=9.\n\nNow, from y_8=2, to y_11=9.\n\nActions at t=8,9,10.\n\ny_11 = y_8 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\ny_8=2\n\nΔy_8, Δy_9, Δy_10 each in {-1,0,1}\n\ny_11 = 2 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\nSet to 9: 2 + sum =9, so sum Δy =7, but each <=1, max sum=3 with three +1, so y_11 <= 2+3=5 <9, impossible to reach y=9 by t=11.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=0 at t=11: min y_11=2-3=-1, but capped at 0, so y_11=0 possible if all down, but y_11=0 is safe only if we are at 0 at t=11.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at t=11, we need to get there.\n\nBut earlier we can be at y=0 at t=10.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a position where we skip the danger rows at the right time.\n\nSince the only danger is at t=10 and 11, and we must not be on 1-8 at those times, we can be on 1-8 at other times.\n\nFor example, we can go up to some y before t=10, then at t=10, be at 0 or 9, but 9 not possible, so only 0.\n\nBut going down to 0 costs time.\n\nWe can stay at y=2 or move to other y, but need to be at 0 at t=10.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10 and 11 we need to be at 0 or 9, and 9 is far, we can go to 0 quickly.\n\nBut from y=2, going down to 0 in two steps: t=8 D, y9=1; t=9 D, y10=0.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut then from y=0 at t=10, we stay at t=10 with S, y11=0.\n\nThen from t=11 onwards, go up to 9.\n\nBut as above, reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier? No, because at t=10 and 11 we are at 0.\n\nt=10 and 11 are fixed times we need to be safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach a higher position before t=10.\n\nFor example, from t=8 to t=9, we can go up.\n\nt=8: y=2, action U, y9=3\n\nThen at t=9, we need to go to y=0 for t=10? But y9=3, to y10=0, need to go down three times in one step? Impossible, Δy max -1 per step.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9, from y9=3, y10 <=4 or >=2, not 0.\n\nSo from y9=3, y10 can be 2,3,4.\n\nNone is 0 or 9, so at t=10, we would be on 2,3, or 4, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we go down at t=8: a8=D, y9=1\n\nThen at t=9, a9: if U, y10=2; if S, y10=1; if D, y10=0.\n\nSo y10 can be 0,1,2.\n\nOnly if a9=D, y10=0, which is safe.\n\nThen a10=S, y11=0.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nIf at t=9, we do not go down, y10=1 or 2, dangerous.\n\nSo only by going down to y=0 at t=10 we can be safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut reaching y=9 at t=20 is late.\n\nSince the danger is only at t=10 and 11, after that, no problem, so we can be on any row after t=11.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we should be as high as possible before t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=2.\n\nIf we go up at t=8: a8=U, y9=3\n\nAt t=9, y9=3, we must go down to reach y=0? But from y=3, y10 min=2 if a9=D, y10=2, which is not 0, and at t=10, y=2 is dangerous.\n\nIf we do nothing at t=8: a8=S, y9=2\n\nThen at t=9, a9=D, y10=1, not 0; or a9=S, y10=2; or a9=U, y10=3; all bad.\n\na9=D, y10=1, dangerous.\n\nOnly if we start going down earlier.\n\nFrom t=8, a8=D, y9=1\n\nThen at t=9, a9=D, y10=0, safe.\n\nThen a10=S, y11=0.\n\nNow, from t=11, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can go up as fast as possible: each turn U, from t=11 to t=20 as before.\n\nBut t=11 is turn 11, y_11=0.\n\na_11=U, y12=1\n\na12=U, y13=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 up moves, at turn t=11+9=20, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from t=8 to t=19? Let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn t | y_t | action a_t\n\nt=8: y=2, a8=D (say)\n\ny9=1\n\nt=9: y=1, a9=D\n\ny10=0\n\nt=10: y=0, a10=S (to stay)\n\ny11=0\n\nt=11: y=0, a11=U\n\ny12=1\n\nt=12: y=1, a12=U\n\ny13=2\n\nt=13: y=2, a13=U\n\ny14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, a14=U\n\ny15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15=U\n\ny16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, a16=U\n\ny17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, a17=U\n\ny18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, a18=U\n\ny19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, a19=U\n\ny20=9\n\nSo at turn t=20, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think from t=8 to t=20, that's 13 turns? Turns involved: t=8 to t=20, that's 13 positions, but the sequence of actions from t=8 to t=19, 12 actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=8, after H actions, at turn 8+H, y=9.\n\nIn the above, from t=8 to t=20, that's after 12 actions? Let's see:\n\nAfter 0 actions: at t=8, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action: at t=9, y=1 (if a8=D)\n\nAfter 2 actions: t=10, y=0\n\nAfter 3 actions: t=11, y=0 (a10=S)\n\nAfter 4 actions: t=12, y=1 (a11=U)\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=8+k.\n\nWe need y_{8+k} =9 for some k.\n\nIn the sequence, after 12 actions: at t=8+12=20, y=9.\n\nActions from a8 to a19, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut min without cars is 7, so with cars, we have extra turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at t=11 or earlier, but we saw impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=10 and 11 we need to be at 0 or 9, but we can be at 0, and then after, go up, but we are at 0 for two turns, which is waste.\n\nBut we have to.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 after t=11 faster by being higher before.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=2, if we go up to y=5 or something by t=9, but t=9 is safe, but then at t=10, we need to be at 0 or 9, but from high y, we cannot reach 0 in one step.\n\nFor instance, t=8: a8=U, y9=3\n\nBut at t=9, y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=10, all dangerous.\n\nNo way to avoid being on 1-8 at t=10 if we are not at 0.\n\nUnless we are at y=0 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for t=11.\n\nSo I think the only way is to go down to 0 at t=10, stay at 0 for t=11, then go up.\n\nBut to minimize H, we can start going up immediately after, but we have to spend two turns at 0 essentially.\n\nt=10 and t=11 we are at 0.\n\nThen from t=11, go up.\n\nBut t=11 is after action a10, position y11.\n\nIn the sequence, from y11=0, we go up.\n\nBut we can consider if we can be at a higher y at some point.\n\nSince the only constraints are at t=10 and 11, we can be at y=2 at t=8, and for example, at t=8, instead of going down, we go up or stay, but then at t=9, we are higher, but still at t=10 we are on 1-8.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 by t=10, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go all the way to 0; what about being at y=9 at t=11?\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=11, from y=2 at t=8, with 3 actions, max y=5, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo only option is to be at y=0 at t=10 and t=11.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the go up phase, from y=0 to y=9, it takes 9 turns, from t=11 to t=20.\n\nBut t=11 is position, actions start from t=11.\n\nLet's list the minimal sequence.\n\nStart: t=8, y=2\n\nTo be safe at t=10, must have y10=0.\n\nThus, need to decrease y from 2 to 0 in two steps: so a8 must be D or S, but if S, y9=2, then to y10=0 need a9=D, but y10=1? y9=2, a9=D, y10=1, not 0.\n\ny8=2\n\nIf a8=D, y9=1\n\nThen if a9=D, y10=0\n\nIf a8=S, y9=2, then a9=D, y10=1\n\nIf a8=U, y9=3, then a9=D, y10=2 or less, min y10=2.\n\nSo only by a8=D and a9=D, we get y10=0.\n\nOther sequences cannot reach y=0 at t=10.\n\nFor example, a8=D, y9=1; a9=S, y10=1; not 0.\n\na8=S, y9=2; a9=S, y10=2; etc.\n\nOnly a8=D, a9=D gives y10=0.\n\nThen at t=10, y=0, we must do a10=S to keep y11=0.\n\nThen at t=11, y=0, we do a11=U, y12=1\n\nThen a12=U, y13=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\na17=U, y18=7\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nSo actions: from t=8 to t=19: a8=D, a9=D, a10=S, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U\n\nThat's 12 actions, H=12.\n\nReach at turn t=20.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H=12, since actions from t=8 to t=19, 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=8.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not going all the way down, but we have to avoid the danger times.\n\nAnother thought: at t=10 and 11, we must be at 0 or 9, but since 9 is not reachable, only 0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, and we can be there.\n\nBut after t=11, no danger, so we can go directly up.\n\nBut from 0 to 9, it takes 9 steps, min.\n\nTotal turns: from t=8 to t=10 we go down to 0, that's two actions, then at t=10 we stay, one action, then from t=11 to t=19 we go up, 9 actions, total actions: 2 (down) + 1 (stay) + 9 (up) = 12 actions.\n\nThe stay at t=10 is necessary to avoid moving and being on 1-8 at t=11.\n\nIf at t=10, y=0, and we do U, then y11=1, then at t=11, y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D, y11=0, but at t=10, action D at y=0, y11=0, same as S.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nBut if we do D at y=0, it might be same as S, y stays 0.\n\nIn terms of action, S or D at y=0 both keep y=0, I think.\n\nBut the action is recorded.\n\nIn this case, to be safe, we need y11=0, so we must not move up or down if at 0 or 9 during danger.\n\nBut in this case, since we are at 0, S or D both keep it.\n\nBut to be consistent, we can use S.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a position where at t=10 we are at 0, but start going up earlier? But at t=9, we are at y=1, which is not high.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if we do S, y9=2, then at t=9, we must do D to get to y10=1? But y10=1 not safe.\n\nNo.\n\nSuppose we go up at t=8 to y=3, but then at t=10 we are at least y=2, dangerous.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or something, but the danger times are fixed.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=11 we also need to be safe, and if we are not at 0 at t=10, but we can be at 9 at t=11, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can be at y=0 at t=11 directly, but to be at y=0 at t=11, from y=2 at t=8, with three actions, we can be at y=2 + sum Δy, min y= -1 capped to 0, so possible, e.g., all down: a8=D, y9=1; a9=D, y10=0; a10=D, y11=0.\n\nThen at t=10, y=0, safe; at t=11, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at t=10, we did a10=D, but y10=0, a10=D, y11=0, same as S.\n\nThen from t=11, y=0, go up to y=9 in 9 steps, reach at t=20.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=10, we do S, y11=0.\n\nNo difference.\n\nStill 12 actions.\n\nBut in this case, with a10=D, it's fine.\n\nBut H same.\n\nTo save one turn, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before t=20 by being higher at some point, but we are forced to be at 0 at t=10 and 11.\n\nFor example, if at t=8, we go up, y9=3, but then at t=10 we are on 3 or so, collision, not avoidable.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nEarlier I assumed all rows have cars covering 0 only at t=10 and 11.\n\nBut let's double-check for one row.\n\nRow 1 at t=10: car A: h=-12, τ=-23, at δt=2, T=10, span [τ +12, h+12] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt t=11, δt=3, [ -23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt t=9, δt=1, [ -23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for rows 5-8, same with car A.\n\nSo no other times.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from turn 8 to turn 19.\n\na8: D\n\na9: D\n\na10: S (or D, but S is fine)\n\na11: U\n\na12: U\n\na13: U\n\na14: U\n\na15: U\n\na16: U\n\na17: U\n\na18: U\n\na19: U\n\nIn the sequence, a10 can be S to stay, since y=0.\n\nSimilarly, in the output.\n\nBut the answer should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the action, at y=0, U is to 1, etc.\n\nNow, in the format.\n\nBut we start from y=2, go down to 1, then to 0, then stay, then up to 9.\n\nIn the up part, we go through all rows, but since after t=11, no danger, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: at t=8, we are at y=2, which is row 2, but at t=8, no issue.\n\nSince we have to be at 0 at t=10, and we start at 2, we lose height.\n\nBut no choice.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, H=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so for H=12, actions at t=8 to t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the output, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for rows 5-8, there are three cars, but only the first one covers, as we saw.\n\nBut all same.\n\nSo.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) on turn 8 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars on all freeways cover position x=0 only at turns 10 and 11, meaning these are the only dangerous turns. At these turns, the player must not be on any row from 1 to 8 to avoid collision. The only safe positions at turns 10 and 11 are y=0 or y=9.\n\nGiven the starting position y=2 at turn 8, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 10 or 11 due to the limited movement per turn (at most +1 in y per action). The only feasible safe option is to reach y=0 by turn 10 and remain there until turn 11. This requires:\n- Moving down from y=2 to y=1 at turn 8 (action D).\n- Moving down from y=1 to y=0 at turn 9 (action D).\n- Staying at y=0 at turn 10 (action S) to ensure safety at turn 10.\n- Remaining at y=0 at turn 11 (action S would keep y=0, but since turn 11 must also be safe, and y=0 is safe, action S is used for consistency.\n\nAfter turn 11, there are no dangerous turns, so the player can move directly up to y=9 as quickly as possible. From y=0 at turn 11, it takes 9 up actions to reach y=9:\n- Turn 11: U to y=1\n- Turn 12: U to y=2\n- Turn 13: U to y=3\n- Turn 14: U to y=4\n- Turn 15: U to y=5\n- Turn 16: U to y=6\n- Turn 17: U to y=7\n- Turn 18: U to y=8\n- Turn 19: U to y=9\n\nThus, the sequence of actions starts at turn 8 and ends at turn 19, with y=9 reached at turn 20 after 12 actions. The minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 8: D (y decreases to 1)\n- Turn 9: D (y decreases to 0)\n- Turn 10: S (y remains 0, safe at turn 10)\n- Turn 11: U (y increases to 1; turn 11 is safe as action occurs after position check)\n- Turn 12: U (y=2)\n- Turn 13: U (y=3)\n- Turn 14: U (y=4)\n- Turn 15: U (y=5)\n- Turn 16: U (y=6)\n- Turn 17: U (y=7)\n- Turn 18: U (y=8)\n- Turn 19: U (y=9)\n\nAt turn 20, the position is (0, 9), achieving the goal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: S \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",
