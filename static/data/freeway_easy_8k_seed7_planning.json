        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is right or left, which affects how they move.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes. Collision is checked based on where I am at the beginning of the turn, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T for collision, and the car positions are for that turn.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is based on car spans at T+1.\n\nAlso, cars move continuously; their positions are updated each turn based on the initial turn t1.\n\nt1 is given as the current turn, which is 0 in this case.\n\nInitial position: (0,0) at turn t1=0.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0, and I need to go to y=9, I have to move up at least 9 times. But I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, which could take more turns.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9 if I only move up, but I might need to wait sometimes.\n\nBut I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t1=0.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is the left end, tail is right? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], then at T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], which is confusing.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left, h is right, since it's increasing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nTypically, head might be the front.\n\nFor a right-moving car, front is at higher x, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and then Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so since both increase, τ must be the left end, h the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h is left end, τ is right end? But it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\".\n\nIn the description: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it moves left, h decreasing, so h must be the left end, and τ the right end? But head is usually front.\n\nThis might be inconsistent.\n\nFor left-moving, if head is at h, and it's moving left, head should be left, tail right.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head right, tail left.\n\nBut in the span notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be [tail, head] or [left, right]?\n\nIt says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, and τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, so τ is smaller, h is larger, so τ is left end, h is right end. But head is at h, which is right, so head is the front.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, h is head, left end.\n\nIn terms of the interval, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span, which is a closed interval.\n\nNow, in the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (h, τ, d, s).\n\nSo for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so since right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But τ and h are given as (h, τ), so it's (head, tail, d, s), so for this, h = -48, τ = -59.\n\nSince direction right, Span = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span = [h, τ].\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so head and tail positions.\n\nFor collision, we need the span at time T.\n\nAlso, since the grid is infinite horizontally, but we only care about x=0.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their spans at time t, relative to t1=0.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1 = T, since t1=0.\n\nSo at turn T, for a car:\n\nIf direction right: Span(T) = [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nSince Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 ∈ Span(T) for some car on k.\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nThe player moves at each turn, so y changes.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and freeways are from 1 to 8, I don't need to worry about cars on y=0 or y=9, I think. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to y=8, so only there cars exist.\n\nAt y=0, no cars, similarly at y=9, no cars. So I can be there safely.\n\nBut at turn T, when I am on a freeway y between 1 and 8, I need to avoid cars at x=0.\n\nNow, the player position: at turn T, I am at (0, y_T), and I choose action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=4.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1=0, Span = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt turn T, Span(T) = [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -59 +4T <= 0 <= -48 +4T\n\nSolve: -59 +4T <=0 => 4T <=59 => T<=14.75, so T<=14 since integer\n\n0 <= -48 +4T => 4T >=48 => T>=12\n\nSo T from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 is in span.\n\nFor T=12: -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, before T=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4), so identical to freeway 1, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSince right, Span at t1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 +4T, 48 +4T]\n\n0 in [37+4T, 48+4T]? Since 37+4T >=37>0 for T>=0, always positive, so 0 never in this span. Safe from this car.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4) head=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +4T, 0 +4T] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n\n0 in this if -11+4T <=0 <=4T\n\nLeft: -11+4T <=0 => 4T<=11 => T<=2.75, T<=2\n\nRight: 0 <=4T always true for T>=0, but since T turn, T>=0.\n\n0 <=4T implies T>=0, but at T=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nBut -11+4T <=0 for T<=2.\n\nSo for T=0: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at T=0,1,2.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has two cars, but the first one is always safe, second one unsafe at T=0,1,2.\n\nSo overall, freeway 3 unsafe at T=0,1,2 due to second car.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), identical, so unsafe at T=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), unsafe T=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so head=48, tail=83? Left-moving, so Span at t1: [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nAt T: [48 -36T, 83 -36T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\nSo 48-36T <= 0 <= 83-36T\n\nLeft: 48-36T <=0 => 36T >=48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2\n\nRight: 0 <= 83-36T => 36T <=83 => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T<=2\n\nT>=2 and T<=2, so only T=2.\n\nAt T=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], 0 in? -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nT=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in\n\nT=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nSo only unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car (48,37,right,4): as before, always safe, since min x=37>0.\n\nSecond car (12,1,right,4): head=12, tail=1, direction right, so Span at t1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +4T, 12 +4T]\n\n0 in [1+4T,12+4T]? Since 1+4T >=1>0 for T>=0, always positive, so 0 never in. Safe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4): head=-24, tail=-35? Direction right, Span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +4T, -24 +4T]\n\n0 in this if -35+4T <=0 <= -24+4T\n\nLeft: -35+4T <=0 => 4T<=35 => T<=8.75, T<=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+4T => 4T >=24 => T>=6\n\nSo T from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nT=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=7: [-35+28,-24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=8: [-35+32,-24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=9: [-35+36,-24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at T=6,7,8 due to third car.\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 7 are safe, so overall unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe (i.e., collision possible at x=0).\n\ny=1: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\ny=2: unsafe T=12,13,14 (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=4: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=5: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=6: unsafe only T=2\n\ny=7: unsafe T=6,7,8\n\ny=8: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nNow, I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I can move U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision only when on freeway y=1 to 8 and at unsafe turn for that freeway.\n\nSince I start at y=0, T=0, and I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to increase y by 9, if no obstacles, I can do it in 9 turns by always moving up.\n\nBut I have to avoid the freeways when they are unsafe.\n\nNow, at T=0, if I stay at y=0 or move, but y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut if I move to y=1 at T=0, that means at turn T=0, I am at y=0, so no collision.\n\nThen at turn T=1, I am at y_1, which could be 1 if I moved up.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen during turn T, collision is checked based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nAfter the move, at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and collision based on that.\n\nFor example, at T=0: I am at y_0 = 0. Since y=0, no freeway, safe. I choose a_0, which sets y_1.\n\nIf I choose U, y_1 = 1.\n\nThen at T=1: I am at y_1 =1, and collision check for freeway y=1 at turn T=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe target is to be at (0,9) at some turn, say T_end, with y_{T_end} =9.\n\nAnd I need minimal H, the number of turns, but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, I am at turn H.\n\nStart at turn 0, after 0 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe position is given at turn t1=0, before any actions.\n\nThen I perform actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, I should be at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter performing a_{t1 + H-1}, I am at turn t1 + H, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, I am at position y_{t1+t}, and collision check at that turn based on y_{t1+t}.\n\nFor simplicity, since t1=0, turn T from 0 to H, with y_H =9.\n\ny_T for T=0 to H-1 are the positions during the moves, and at T=H, position y_H=9.\n\nCollision check at each T from 0 to H-1, since at T=H, if I am at y=9, no freeway, safe, so no need to check collision at T=H, only during the journey when on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and collision occurs during the turns when on freeway.\n\nBut at the turn when I reach y=9, if it was a freeway, but y=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nThe unsafe times for each y.\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=2: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\ny=3: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=4: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=5: unsafe T=0,1,2\n\ny=6: unsafe only T=2\n\ny=7: unsafe T=6,7,8\n\ny=8: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nNote that y=6 is unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSince I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nIf I move up immediately, at T=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy.\n\nSuppose I move up at T=0, so a_0 = U, then y_1 = 1.\n\nThen at T=1, I am at y=1, and need to check if unsafe.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at T=12-14, which is later, so at T=1, y=1 should be safe? Let's see.\n\nFor y=1, unsafe at T=12,13,14. At T=1, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I keep moving up, I can go to y=2,3,etc.\n\nBut problems at certain points.\n\nFor example, if I go directly up:\n\nStart T=0, y=0, safe.\n\na_0 = U, to y_1=1\n\nT=1, y=1, safe since not T=12-14\n\na_1 = U, to y_2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, safe? y=2 unsafe at T=12-14, not at T=2, so safe.\n\na_2 = U, to y_3=3\n\nT=3, y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=0,1,2. T=3>2, so at T=3, should be safe? For y=3, unsafe only T=0,1,2, so at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 unsafe only T=0,1,2, so after T=2, safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=2.\n\ny=7 unsafe T=6,7,8\n\ny=8 unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSo if I go directly up:\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\na_0=U, y=1\n\nT=1: y=1, safe (y1 unsafe only later)\n\na_1=U, y=2\n\nT=2: y=2, safe (y2 unsafe later)\n\na_2=U, y=3\n\nT=3: y=3, now y=3 unsafe only T=0,1,2, T=3>2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_3=U, y=4\n\nT=4: y=4, safe (unsafe only T=0,1,2)\n\na_4=U, y=5\n\nT=5: y=5, safe\n\na_5=U, y=6\n\nT=6: y=6, now y=6 unsafe only at T=2, not T=6, so safe.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at T=6,7,8, but I am at y=6 now.\n\nT=6, y=6, safe.\n\na_6=U, to y=7\n\nThen T=7: y=7, but y=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8. At T=7, unsafe.\n\nCollision at T=7 if on y=7.\n\nSo if I arrive at y=7 at T=7, I would collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at T=6 or T=8, also unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at T=6,7, or 8.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut let's continue the path.\n\nIn direct path:\n\nAt T=6: y=6, after a_6=U, y_7=7\n\nThen at T=7: y=7, which is unsafe since T=7 is in 6,7,8.\n\nSo collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I am slower.\n\nStart T=0 y=0\n\na_0=S, stay, y_1=0\n\nT=1 y=0 safe\n\nBut y=0 safe always.\n\nThen I can delay.\n\nBut I need to reach fast.\n\nSince y=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8, I need to avoid being on y=7 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 unsafe at T=0,1,2, but since I start at T=0 y=0, and I can move later, but T=0,1,2 are early, so if I don't go to y=3,4,5 at those turns, I am fine, since later they are safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, y=6 only unsafe at T=2, so as long as not at y=6 at T=2, safe.\n\ny=1,2,8 unsafe at T=12-14, which are late.\n\nBut I might reach before that.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, H=9, arrive at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut on the way, when I pass y=7.\n\nIf I go directly, at T=7 I am at y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nT=7 is within 6,7,8.\n\nI need to be on y=7 not at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo possible to be at T=5, or T=9 or later, but T=9 is y=9, not y=7.\n\nWhen I am on y=7, at some turn.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, unsafe at T=12-14, but if I reach early, say before T=12, it might be safe.\n\nFirst, let's find safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor y=1: safe except T=12,13,14. So safe for T<=11 or T>=15.\n\nBut T is turn, integer.\n\nSimilarly y=2: same, safe T<=11 or T>=15.\n\ny=3: unsafe T=0,1,2, safe for T>=3\n\ny=4: same, safe T>=3\n\ny=5: same, safe T>=3\n\ny=6: unsafe only T=2, so safe for T!=2, i.e., T<=1 or T>=3\n\ny=7: unsafe T=6,7,8, so safe for T<=5 or T>=9\n\ny=8: unsafe T=12,13,14, safe for T<=11 or T>=15\n\nNow, I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some T.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to reach as soon as possible, so T around 9.\n\nBut at T=7, if I am at y=7, it is unsafe, so I cannot be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 at T=6 or T=8.\n\nSo I need to either pass y=7 quickly when safe, or be there at safe time.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I have to be on each y for at least one turn, except possibly start and end.\n\nI start at y=0, end at y=9.\n\nFor each y from 1 to 8, I must be on it at some turn to cross, but I can stay or move, so I might be on a y multiple turns.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should not stay unnecessarily.\n\nNow, the critical point is y=7, which is unsafe from T=6 to 8, so I need to be on y=7 at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways may have constraints.\n\ny=6 is only unsafe at T=2, so easy to avoid.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths to reach y=9 by T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=9.\n\nThen at T=8, I must be at y=8 or y=9? When I reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I arrive at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThen at T-1, I was at y=8 or y=9? If I move up from y=8 at T-1, then y_T=9.\n\nIf I stay at y=9, but I can arrive earlier.\n\nFor min time, assume I arrive at T=9 with y=9.\n\nThen at T=8, I was at y=8, and I moved U to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7, I was at y=7 or y=8 or y=6, etc.\n\nNow, at T=8, if I am at y=8, and y=8 is unsafe at T=12-14, but T=8<12, so safe, since safe for T<=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7, if I am at y=7, but y=7 unsafe at T=7, so I cannot be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nTherefore, at T=7, I cannot be at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, cannot be at y=7; at T=8, cannot be at y=7.\n\nBut at T=7, if I am not at y=7, I could be at y=6 or y=8 or other.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=9, at T=8 I need to be at y=8 to move up, or at y=9 already, but let's assume not.\n\nSo at T=8, y=8.\n\nThen a_8=U, to y=9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=8, y=8, safe since T=8<12.\n\nNow at T=7, where was I?\n\nI could be at y=7 or y=8 or y=6.\n\nBut if I am at y=7 at T=7, unsafe, so I cannot be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nTherefore, at T=7, I must not be at y=7.\n\nSo I could be at y=6 or y=8.\n\nIf at y=8 at T=7, then I could stay or move, but to reach y=8 at T=8, if I am at y=8 at T=7, I can stay, then at T=8 y=8, then move up.\n\nBut that takes extra turn.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at T=7, then I need to go to y=7 and then to y=8, but going to y=7 at T=7 or T=8 is unsafe.\n\nAt T=7, if I am at y=6, I can move up to y=7 at T=8? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action, y_{T+1}.\n\nIf at T=7, I am at y=6, then I choose a_7.\n\nIf a_7=U, then y_8=7.\n\nThen at T=8, I am at y=7, but y=7 unsafe at T=8, since T=8 is in 6,7,8? y=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo if I am at y=7 at T=8, collision.\n\nIf at T=7, I am at y=6, and I move up, y_8=7, then at T=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I move to y=7 at T=7, but at T=7, if I go to y=7, that means at T=7 I was at y=6 or y=7, but when I move to y=7 at turn T=7, that means I was at y_T at T=7, and after action y_{T+1}=7.\n\nAt turn T=7, position is y_7, which is before the action.\n\nIf I move to y=7 at T=7, it means y_7 was say y=6, I do U, so y_8=7.\n\nThen at turn T=7, I am at y_7=6, so collision check at y=6, T=7.\n\ny=6 at T=7: y=6 safe except T=2, T=7!=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, I am at y=7, collision if unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=7 at T=6 or T=7 or T=8, all unsafe.\n\nThe only safe times for y=7 are T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut T<=5: at T=5, I could be at y=7, but let's see if possible.\n\nT=5 is early, y=7 is high, I might not reach by T=5.\n\nSimilarly, T>=9: at T=9, I am at y=9, not on y=7.\n\nSo to be on y=7, it must be at some T with T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut T>=9, if I am at y=7 at T=9, that means I arrived late, but I want to reach y=9 early, so probably not efficient.\n\nSo better to be on y=7 at T<=5.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nNow, let's find a path where I am on y=7 at T<=5.\n\nFor example, at T=5, y=7.\n\nThen I need to reach y=7 by T=5.\n\nFrom start, T=0 y=0.\n\nTo reach y=7 at T=5, I need to increase y by 7 in 5 turns, so net +7 in 5 actions.\n\nPossible if I move up 7 times, but 7 up in 5 turns? Not possible, since each action changes by at most 1, so in 5 actions, I can be at y<=5.\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, y<=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, y<=2\n\n...\nAfter k actions, y <= k.\n\nAt turn T, after t actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, I have performed T actions? No.\n\nStart: turn 0, position after 0 actions.\n\nAfter first action a_0, at turn 1, position y_1.\n\nGenerally, at turn T, position y_T, which is after T actions? At turn 0, before any actions, position y_0.\n\nAfter a_0, at turn 1, position y_1.\n\nSo after k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nTo have y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=5, so y_5=7.\n\nFrom y_0=0, to y_5=7, I need net +7 in 5 steps, but each step Δy = -1,0,+1, so maximum increase is 5, to y=5, cannot reach y=7 in 5 turns. Impossible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y<=4, etc.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=7 is T=7, with y_7=7, if I move up every turn.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo I must be on y=7 at some other time, but since I have to pass through it, and the safe times are T<=5 or T>=9, but T<=5 impossible as above, T>=9 means I am at y=7 at T>=9, but at T=9 I am at y=9 if I reach on time, or later.\n\nIf I reach y=9 at T=9, I am not on y=7 at T=9.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at T=9, that means I am late, and I need to go to y=8 and 9 later.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nSimilarly, for T=10, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid being on y=7 during unsafe times by timing.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=7 at T=6,7,8, and I must be on it at some point, I need to be on it at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut T<=5 impossible, so must be at T>=9.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at some T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, it is unsafe at T=12-14, but if I reach before, it might be ok.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSuppose I reach at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=9.\n\nAt T=8, I must have been at y=8, and moved U.\n\nAt T=8, y=8, safe since T=8<12.\n\nAt T=7, I was at some y, say y_7.\n\nThen y_8 = y_7 + Δy, so if y_8=8, then y_7 could be 7,8, or 9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nIf y_7=7, then a_7=U or S, if a_7=U, y_8=8; if S, y_8=7, not 8.\n\nBut we need y_8=8, so must have y_7=7 or 8.\n\nIf y_7=7, a_7=U, y_8=8.\n\nBut if y_7=7 at T=7, unsafe, not allowed.\n\nIf y_7=8, then a_7 could be S or D, but to have y_8=8, a_7=S, then y_8=8.\n\nThen at T=7, y_7=8, which is safe, since y=8 safe at T=7<12.\n\nThen no problem.\n\nBut how did I get to y_7=8?\n\nAt T=7, y=8.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=8 at T=7.\n\ny_0=0, to y_7=8, net +8 in 7 turns, possible with 8 up and 0 down, but in 7 actions, I can be at y=7 max, since each action at most +1.\n\nAt turn 0: y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: y<=1\n\nAfter 2: y<=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 actions: at turn 7, y<=7.\n\nSo y_7 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=8 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y<=6; T=5, y<=5, etc.\n\nSo at T=7, y_7 <=7.\n\nTo have y_8=8, we must have y_7=7 and a_7=U.\n\nBut if y_7=7 at T=7, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=9, because it requires being at y=7 at T=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I reach at T=8, y=9.\n\nThen at T=7, I must be at y=8 or y=9? If at y=8, a_7=U to y=9 at T=8.\n\nAt T=7, y=7 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut y_7 <=7, so y_7 <=7.\n\nIf y_7=7, a_7=U, y_8=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=8, I need y_8=9, so from y_7, if a_7=U, y_8=y_7+1, so if y_7=8, y_8=9.\n\nBut y_7 <=7, impossible.\n\nIf I am at y=9 at T=7, but y_7 <=7, so only if y_7=7 and I stay, but then y_8=7, not 9.\n\nSo to have y_8=9, I must have y_7=8 and a_7=U, but y_7 <=7, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for any T, to reach y=9 at turn T, I need to have been at y=8 at turn T-1 and moved up, or at y=9 and stayed, but to arrive, it's from y=8.\n\nSo at turn T-1, I must be at y=8, and a_{T-1}=U.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nAt turn T-1, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, for T=9, at T=8, I am at y=8, which requires at T=7, I was at y=7 or y=8, but y_7<=7, so must be y_7=7 and a_7=U to y_8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 unsafe, so collision.\n\nTherefore, for any T, to reach y=9 at T, I need to be at y=8 at T-1, which requires being at y=7 at T-2 or something, but specifically, at some point I must be at y=7 at a turn when it might be unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, for y=7, if T-1 is between 6 and 8, it is unsafe.\n\nBut let's find when I can be at y=7 safely.\n\nI must be at y=7 at some S with S <=5 or S>=9.\n\nS<=5 impossible, as y_S <= S.\n\nFor S>=9, at turn S, y_S=7.\n\nThen I can move to y=8 later.\n\nBut to reach y=9 quickly, I should not stay at low y.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, it is unsafe at T=12-14, so if I reach y=8 before T=12, it is safe.\n\nNow, let's find the minimal T where I can be at y=9.\n\nSuppose I go up as fast as possible but avoid being on y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nT<=5 impossible, so T>=9.\n\nThus, I must be at y=7 at some T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=6 at T=7 or something.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nI need to delay reaching y=7 until T>=9.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go fast to y=6, then wait, or something.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nI can move up to y=1 at T=1, y=2 at T=2, but at T=2, if I am at y=2, safe, but y=6 is unsafe at T=2, but I am not on y=6 yet.\n\nAt T=2, I can be at y=2.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut when I approach y=7.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=7 at T=6,7,8, I need to be there at T=5 or earlier, impossible, or T=9 or later.\n\nSo let's aim to be at y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=7.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 and y=9, so at least two more turns, reach at T=11.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, safe since T=9>=9.\n\nThen I can move up to y=8 at T=10, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nAt T=10, y=8, safe since T=10<12.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=11 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nStart turn 0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nSo if at turn 9, y=7, then a_9=U to y=10? y_10=8\n\nThen a_10=U to y_11=9.\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9, so H=11 actions.\n\nBut earlier at turn 9, y=7, which is late.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at T=9, but maybe I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=9, I need to have taken my time to reach y=7 slowly.\n\nFor example, from T=0 to T=9, I go from y=0 to y=7, which is net +7 in 9 turns, so I must have stayed or moved down some turns.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go as fast as possible to y=6, then wait until T=9 to go to y=7.\n\ny=6 is safe except at T=2.\n\nSo I can be on y=6 at any time except T=2.\n\nNow, let's see how fast I can reach y=6.\n\nStart T=0 y=0\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nAt T=2, y=2, safe.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3 y=3, safe since T=3>2 for y=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4 y=4 safe\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\nT=5 y=5 safe\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nT=6 y=6, now y=6 safe except T=2, T=6!=2, safe.\n\nSo at T=6, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=7, but if I go at T=6, to y=7 at T=7, then at T=7 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\ny=6 safe as long as not T=2.\n\nBut I need to go to y=7 at T>=9.\n\nSo at T=6, y=6, I can stay or move down, but moving down is bad.\n\nSo stay at y=6 for a few turns.\n\nThen at some point go to y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=9, for example.\n\nAt T=6, y=6\n\nI can stay: a6=S, y7=6\n\nT=7, y=6, safe\n\na7=S, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, safe\n\nThen a8=U, to y=7 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, to y=8 at T=10\n\nT=10 y=8, safe (T=10<12)\n\na10=U, to y=9 at T=11\n\nT=11 y=9\n\nSo reached at T=11 with H=11 actions.\n\nBut from T=6 to T=8, I stayed at y=6 for three turns, which is inefficient.\n\nI could go to y=6 later.\n\nSince y=7 must be after T=8, I can reach y=6 earlier and stay, or reach later.\n\nTo minimize time, I should reach y=6 as early as possible and stay until it is safe to move up.\n\nEarliest to reach y=6 is T=6, as above.\n\nThen I need to stay until T=8, so at T=9 go to y=7.\n\nStaying from T=6 to T=8, that's three turns at y=6: T=6,7,8 positions y=6.\n\nThen at T=9, y=7.\n\nBut T=8, I am at y=6, then a8=U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I reduce the waiting?\n\ny=7 is unsafe only at T=6,7,8, so at T=9 it is safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at T=5, but impossible.\n\nOr T=9 is the earliest possible to be on y=7 safely.\n\nT=9 is the first safe turn after the unsafe period.\n\nNow, during the waiting, I could move to other y, but y=5 or y=7, but y=7 not yet, y=5 is safe after T=2.\n\nBut moving down might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=6, instead of staying at y=6, I could move down to y=5, but that would make me slower.\n\nFor instance, at T=6 y=6, a6=D to y=5, then at T=7 y=5, then I need to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6.\n\nBut I can reach y=6 later to reduce waiting.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=6 at T=7, then I can stay at T=7 and T=8 at y=6, then go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut reaching y=6 at T=7 is later than T=6, so I start later, might not be better.\n\nLet's compare.\n\nFirst scenario: reach y=6 at T=6, then stay at y=6 for T=6,7,8 (three turns: T=6,7,8 positions y=6), then at T=9 y=7, T=10 y=8, T=11 y=9.\n\nT=6 y=6, T=7 y=6, T=8 y=6, T=9 y=7, T=10 y=8, T=11 y=9.\n\nArrive at T=11.\n\nIf I reach y=6 later.\n\nSuppose I delay going up.\n\nFor example, start at T=0 y=0.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for some turns, but that delays everything.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr move slower to y=6.\n\nFor example, at T=0 y=0, a0=S, stay, y1=0\n\nT=1 y=0\n\na1=U, y2=1\n\nBut at T=2, if I am at y=1 or something.\n\nTo reach y=6 at T=7.\n\nFrom start, min to y=6 is 6 actions, at T=6 y=6.\n\nIf I take more actions, I reach later.\n\nFor example, if I stay one turn: T=0 y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nT=1 y=0\n\na1=U, y2=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nSo at T=7, y=7? y7=6? After a6=U, at turn 7, y=6.\n\nT=7, y=6.\n\nThen I can stay: a7=S, y8=6\n\nT=8 y=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9 y=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10 y=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11 y=9, same as before.\n\nIf I go directly to y=6 at T=6, and stay two turns? From T=6 to T=7 and T=8.\n\nAt T=6 y=6, stay a6=S, y7=6, T=7 y=6\n\na7=S, y8=6, T=8 y=6\n\nThen a8=U, y9=7, T=9 y=7\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut at T=8, I am at y=6, then go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nNow, at T=9 y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10, safe.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier than T=11?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at T=9 or something.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=9, I need y_9=8.\n\nFrom start, to y_9=8, net +8 in 9 turns, possible with one stay or something.\n\nBut earlier, at T=7, I need to be at y=7 or 8, but y_7<=7.\n\nSuppose I go up fast to y=5 or 6.\n\nThen at some point I can jump.\n\nBut I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 must be avoided during T=6-8, I can be on y=7 at T=5, impossible, or at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, I can be at y=7, then go up.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=9, I must have spent 9 turns to gain 7 in y, so I had two extra actions where I stayed or moved down.\n\nBut in the path above, from T=6 to T=8, I stayed at y=6 for three turns, but that's from y=6, which I reached at T=6.\n\nThe net from start to T=9 y=7 is +7 in 9 turns, so I have two \"wasted\" actions where Δy=0 or -1.\n\nIn the stay at y=6, I used S actions, Δy=0.\n\nBut I could have used those actions earlier to delay, but it might not save time.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=0 for one turn: T=0 y=0, a0=S, y1=0\n\nThen from T=1 to T=6: a1 to a5 U, y2=1, y3=2, y4=3, y5=4, y6=5\n\nAfter a0=S, y1=0\n\na1=U, y2=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nAt T=7 y=6\n\nThen I need to stay until T=8: a7=S, y8=6\n\nT=8 y=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9 y=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10 y=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11 y=9, same as before, and I wasted a turn at start.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at T=6, then at T=6, I stay, T=7 y=6, stay, T=8 y=6, then T=9 y=7.\n\nBut from T=6 to T=8, I am at y=6 for three turns.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6 is safe, no problem.\n\nNow, what about other constraints?\n\nFor example, when I go to y=8 and y=9, it should be fine since T=10 and T=11 are before 12.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at T=12,13,14, but T=10 and 11 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in this path, I have to stay at y=6 for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 or other during the waiting, but y=6 is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, y=3,4,5 are unsafe at T=0,1,2, but in the path, I am not on them at those times.\n\nFor example, in the direct path to y=6 at T=6:\n\nT=0 y=0, not on freeway\n\nT=1 y=1, safe (not unsafe time)\n\nT=2 y=2, safe\n\nT=3 y=3, safe (T=3>2)\n\nT=4 y=4, safe\n\nT=5 y=5, safe\n\nT=6 y=6, safe\n\nThen stay T=7 y=6, T=8 y=6\n\nT=9 y=7\n\nT=10 y=8\n\nT=11 y=9\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut at T=9 y=7, is it safe? y=7 safe for T>=9, T=9>=9, yes.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose I go to y=7 at T=9, but can I be at y=8 at T=9? No, y_9<=9, but to be at y=8 at T=9, possible if I had down moves, but not helpful.\n\nMinimal T to reach y=9 is 11, I think.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=9.\n\nThen at T=9, I must be at y=8 and a9=U.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, which is safe since T=9<12.\n\nNow, at T=8, where am I?\n\ny_8 must be 7 or 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, then a8=S, y9=8\n\nOr y_8=7, a8=U, y9=8\n\nBut if y_8=7, at T=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nIf y_8=8, then a8=S, y9=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, how to have y_8=8.\n\ny_0=0, to y_8=8, net +8 in 8 turns, possible only if all U, y_8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y_7=7, and a7=U to y8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y_7=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I have some down, but then y_8<8, not 8.\n\nSo impossible to have y_8=8 without being at y=7 at T=7 or earlier.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_8=8, I must have been at y=7 at T=7 with a7=U, but T=7 y=7 unsafe.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at T=10 or earlier.\n\nSimilarly, T=11 is possible, as above.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the path above, I have:\n\nStart T=0, y=0\n\na0: U, to y=1\n\nT=1, y=1\n\na1: U, to y=2\n\nT=2, y=2\n\na2: U, to y=3\n\nT=3, y=3\n\na3: U, to y=4\n\nT=4, y=4\n\na4: U, to y=5\n\nT=5, y=5\n\na5: U, to y=6\n\nT=6, y=6\n\na6: S, stay y=6\n\nT=7, y=6\n\na7: S, stay y=6\n\nT=8, y=6\n\na8: U, to y=7\n\nT=9, y=7\n\na9: U, to y=8\n\nT=10, y=8\n\na10: U, to y=9\n\nT=11, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\nT=1: y=1, not unsafe time (only 12-14), safe\n\nT=2: y=2, not unsafe, safe\n\nT=3: y=3, unsafe only 0,1,2, T=3>2, safe\n\nT=4: y=4, similar, safe\n\nT=5: y=5, safe\n\nT=6: y=6, unsafe only T=2, not, safe\n\nT=7: y=6, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, safe since T=9>=9\n\nT=10: y=8, safe T=10<12\n\nT=11: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10?\n\nH=10 actions, arrive at turn 10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8 or 9, but y_9<=9.\n\nIf y_9=8, a9=U to y10=9.\n\nOr y_9=9, a9=S, but then arrived earlier.\n\nBut to have y_10=9, if not already, must have y_9=8 and a9=U.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, at T=8, y must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y_8=7, a8=U to y9=8, but at T=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nIf y_8=8, then a8=S to y9=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=8, safe.\n\nBut to have y_8=8, from start, must have y_7=7 and a7=U to y8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y_7=7, unsafe.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nIf I am at y=9 at T=9, then I arrived at T=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=9, I must have y_9=9.\n\nThen at T=8, y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, a8=U to y9=9.\n\nBut then at T=8, y=8, safe, but how to have y_8=8.\n\ny_8=8 requires y_7=7 and a7=U, but T=7 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=9, impossible since y_8<=8.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 11 actions to reach at T=11.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions from t1=0.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from a0 to a10.\n\na0 to a10 is 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so H=11.\n\nNow, but in the waiting, I stayed at y=6 for three turns: a6=S, a7=S, but at T=6,7,8 I am at y=6.\n\nT=6,7,8 positions y=6.\n\nThen a8=U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nI could reduce the waiting if possible, but I need to avoid T=6,7,8 for y=7, so I have to be on y=6 until T=8.\n\nAt T=8, I am at y=6, then move to y=7 at T=9.\n\nIf I move to y=7 at T=8, but then at T=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo must wait.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 or other during that time, but moving down and up takes more actions.\n\nFor example, at T=6 y=6, instead of stay, I move down to y=5 at T=7, then at T=7 y=5, then I can move up to y=6 at T=8, but then at T=8 y=6, same as before, then I still need to go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut I used extra down and up, which cost actions, and I arrive later.\n\nFor instance: T=6 y=6, a6=D, to y=5 at T=7\n\nT=7 y=5, a7=U, to y=6 at T=8\n\nT=8 y=6, a8=U, to y=7 at T=9\n\nThen same as before, but I have one extra action: a6=D and a7=U instead of a6=S and a7=S? In the first, I had a6=S, a7=S, a8=U.\n\nHere a6=D, a7=U, a8=U, so to reach y=7 at T=9, same, but I used D and U instead of S and S, which is the same number, but I was at lower y, not better.\n\nAnd I had to go down and up, no gain.\n\nSo staying is fine.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the car states, I think I covered all.\n\nBut let's confirm y=6 at T=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=2, so T=6,7,8 all safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in freeway 7, there is a car, but since I am not on y=7 during unsafe times, ok.\n\nNow, the action sequence:\n\nTurn t1=0: a0 = U\n\nTurn 1: a1 = U\n\nTurn 2: a2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a6 = S  (stay at y=6)\n\nTurn 7: a7 = S  (stay at y=6)\n\nTurn 8: a8 = U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 9: a9 = U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 10: a10 = U  (to y=9)\n\nAfter a10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nAnswer format: list for each turn.\n\nBut t1=0, so:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I go to y=7 at T=9, but can I reach y=9 faster from there?\n\nNo, because from y=7 at T=9, I need two more up to y=9 at T=11.\n\nUnless I can be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nBut y_9 <=9, if y_9=8, then I can go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut how to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\ny_9=8.\n\nFrom y_0=0 to y_9=8, net +8 in 9 turns, so I must have one action with Δy=0 or -1.\n\nFor example, if I have one stay.\n\nThen I can reach y=8 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=8, safe.\n\nThen a9=U to y=10=9 at T=10.\n\nNow, to have y_9=8, I need to avoid being at y=7 during unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, at some point I must be at y=7.\n\nSuppose I am at y=7 at T=S.\n\nS must be <=5 or >=9.\n\nS<=5 impossible.\n\nS>=9.\n\nSo at T=9, I could be at y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf at y=7 at T=9, then I go to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf at y=8 at T=9, I go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=9, how?\n\ny_9=8.\n\nSince S>=9 for y=7, if I am at y=8 at T=9, I must have been at y=7 at some T<9, but T<9, during T=6-8, unsafe.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at T=9, I must have come from y=7 or y=8 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=8, y=7, then a8=U to y9=8, but at T=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=8, y=8, then a8=S to y9=8.\n\nBut to have y8=8, similarly, requires y7=7 at T=7, unsafe.\n\nThus, it is impossible to be at y=8 at T=9 without having been at y=7 during T=6-8.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=7 at T=9, then proceed.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, I have three S? In my sequence, I have two S at turn 6 and 7, and actions up otherwise.\n\nIn the sequence: a0 to a5: U (6 actions), a6 and a7: S (two actions), a8 U, a9 U, a10 U.\n\nAfter a10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nI could have only one S, but I need to stay at least two turns? From T=6 to T=8, I need to be at y=6 for T=6,7,8, which requires three positions, but since I am at y=6 from after a5, at T=6, and I need to be there until T=8, so I need to stay at T=6 and T=7, meaning actions a6 and a7 S, so that at T=6,7,8 y=6.\n\nIf I do only one S, say a6=S, then at T=7 y=6, then if a7=U, to y=7 at T=8, but T=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I need both a6 and a7 to be S to stay at y=6 for T=7 and T=8.\n\nAt T=6, after a5=U, y=6.\n\nThen a6: if S, y7=6\n\na7: if S, y8=6\n\na8: U, y9=7\n\nYes.\n\nIf I do a6=S, then at T=7 y=6, if I do a7=S, y8=6, etc.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nSo two S actions necessary.\n\nThus, the sequence is minimal.\n\nNow, write in the answer format.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd after turn 10, at turn 11, position y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to 10, H=11.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 6 or others.\n\nFor example, at T=2, I was at y=2, not y=6, so no issue with y=6 unsafe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by moving up as quickly as possible to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 6, then staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 6 and 7 to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) during its unsafe turns (6, 7, and 8), and finally moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 0**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- **Turn 1**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- **Turn 6**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) (avoids \\(y = 7\\) at turn 7, which is unsafe).\n- **Turn 7**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) (avoids \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8, which is unsafe).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(T = 9 \\geq 9\\)).\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(T = 10 < 12\\)).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAfter turn 10, at turn 11, the position is (0, 9), and no collisions occur, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 0**: \\(y = 0\\), no freeway, safe.\n- **Turn 1**: \\(y = 1\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 12–14).\n- **Turn 2**: \\(y = 2\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 12–14).\n- **Turn 3**: \\(y = 3\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 0–2).\n- **Turn 4**: \\(y = 4\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 0–2).\n- **Turn 5**: \\(y = 5\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 0–2).\n- **Turn 6**: \\(y = 6\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 2).\n- **Turn 7**: \\(y = 6\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 2).\n- **Turn 8**: \\(y = 6\\), safe (unsafe only at turn 2).\n- **Turn 9**: \\(y = 7\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 6–8, and \\(T = 9 \\geq 9\\)).\n- **Turn 10**: \\(y = 8\\), safe (unsafe only at turns 12–14).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 11\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,3) at turn t1 = 3. The goal is to reach (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car whose span includes 0 at that exact turn. The player's position is updated after the action, so when you move to a new y at turn T+1, you're not on that y at turn T, so you only check for collisions on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their positions, right-moving increase.\n\nGiven the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-36,-47, right, 4). Since it's right-moving, the span is from τ to h, so tail -47 to head -36. At turn t1=3, position is [-47, -36] for a right-moving car? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4). But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think? -36 is greater than -47, yes, since -36 > -47.\n\nSo for right-moving car, head is the right end, tail is left end? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFrom the update: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] with h and τ, but it says head at h, tail at τ, and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] which might be decreasing if h > τ or what? I need to clarify.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease. And [h, τ] might imply h is left or right? It says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but for left-moving, head should be the front when moving left, so if moving left, head is smaller position? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to direction.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is the front, so higher position number, tail is lower position.\n\nFor left-moving, head is front, so lower position number, tail is higher? But let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSince positions decrease, if h and τ are such that for left-moving, h should be greater than τ? Let's take an example.\n\nIn freeway 6, there's a left-moving car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nAt t1=3, Span = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nSince left-moving, positions decrease over time.\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-60 - 36(T-3), -25 - 36(T-3)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in [left, right] for that car at turn T when player is on that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nBack to freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36] since τ = -47, h = -36.\n\nAt time T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t1=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on y=1 to y=8 when we are on those rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no freeways there, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once we are at (0,9), we are done, and no collision there.\n\nNow, the player can stay or move up/down, but since we start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, moving down might not help, but could be used to avoid cars, but since cars are only on the freeways, and we need to go up, probably moving down delays, so minimal turns likely involve moving up as much as possible, but avoiding cars when on y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=3 has no car? Let's see the car states: freeways 1 to 8 have cars, but freeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, so for each row y=1 to 8, there are cars.\n\nBut at y=3, is there a car? Freeway 3 has cars: (60,49, right,4) and (12,1, right,4)\n\nAt turn t, collision if player on y=k and for some car on that row, 0 in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSo for y=3 at time T, if 0 in span of any car on freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3) at turn t1=3.\n\nSo at turn 3, player is on y=3. Need to check if there is collision at turn 3 on y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 has two cars: (60,49, right,4) and (12,1, right,4)\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,4). Since right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)]? t1 is the current turn, which is 3.\n\nIn the car update, it's from t1 to T, but for a given time, we need the span at that time.\n\nSet t as the absolute turn number.\n\nAt turn t, for a car with initial at t1=3, span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(t-3), h + s(t-3)]\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s(t-3), τ - s(t-3)]\n\nNow for freeway 3 at turn t=3:\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,4), so h=60, τ=49, s=4\n\nSpan at t=3: [49 + 4(3-3), 60 + 4(0)] = [49,60]? Since t-3=0.\n\n[τ + s(t-3), h + s(t-3)] = [49 + 0, 60 + 0] = [49,60]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1, right,4), h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\nSpan at t=3: [1 + 0, 12 + 0] = [1,12]\n\nNow, 0 is not in [49,60] nor in [1,12], so at turn 3, on y=3, no collision. Good, player can start.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 turns, all up moves, if no cars block.\n\nBut there might be cars, so we need to check for each row at each time if moving there causes collision.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, we can plan the sequence.\n\nBut the cars move, so we need to simulate when the player is on each row.\n\nAlso, since we start at turn 3, and we want min H, so we need to find actions from turn 3 to turn 3+H-1 such that at turn 3+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet T be the turn number, starting from T=3.\n\nPlayer y at T=3 is 3.\n\nWe need to choose actions a_T for T=3,4,5,... such that after H actions, y_{3+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position is for that turn.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen, after choosing action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, player is on row y_T, and we check collision for that row at turn T.\n\nIf not collided, we proceed.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at T=3, y_3 =3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=3+H, y_{3+H} should be 9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at T=3, y=3.\n\nAfter first action at T=3, we go to y_4.\n\nGenerally: after k actions, we are at turn 3+k, with y_{3+k}.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at T=3, y=3, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 6, so minimum H=6 if we always move up.\n\nBut with possible stays or down moves to avoid, H might be larger.\n\nFirst, let's list all car positions over time for each row, to see when 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, we can find for each row, the times when there is a car covering position 0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on row k, and for some car on row k, 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nSo for each row k=1 to 8, we need the set of times T where no car covers 0, so that it is safe to be on that row at that time.\n\nIf for a row, at certain times, 0 is covered, it is unsafe at those times.\n\nWe need to find a path from T=3, y=3 to some T, y=9, with actions in between.\n\nSince min H, we aim for H=6, reaching at T=9 with y=9.\n\nT=3 to T=8? Let's calculate turns.\n\nAt start: turn T=3, y=3\n\nAfter action a_3, at turn T=4, y= y3 + Δy3\n\nSimilarly, after a_4, T=5, y= y4 + Δy4, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn T=3+H, with y_{3+H}.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAnd we start from y_3=3.\n\nThe number of turns is H, meaning H actions from T=3 to T=3+H-1? I think I have confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"current turn is t1\" so t1=3.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nSo actions at time t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so times: t1, t1+1, t1+2, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is at time t1 + H.\n\nAt time t1 + H, y_{t1+H} should be 9.\n\nAnd we start at time t1, y_{t1} =3.\n\nSo from time t1 to time t1+H, y changes from 3 to 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H.\n\nMinimum possible H is 6, if we move up each time.\n\nNow, let's check for each row y=4,5,6,7,8 when it is safe to be there, since we need to pass through them.\n\ny=3 and y=9 are safe, as y=3 at T=3 is safe, and y=9 has no cars.\n\nBut when moving, we might be on y=3 at other times, but y=3 has cars, so we need to check when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car (-36,-47, right,4)\n\nRight-moving, so at time T, span: [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3)]\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 4(T-3) <= 0 <= -36 + 4(T-3)\n\nSolve:\n\n-47 + 4(T-3) <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 4(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 4(T-3) <= 0 => 4(T-3) <= 47 => T-3 <= 47/4 = 11.75, so T <= 14.75, so T <= 14 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 4(T-3) => 36 <= 4(T-3) => 9 <= T-3 => T >= 12\n\nSo 0 in span when T >=12 and T<=14.\n\nT from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nFor T=12,13,14, 0 is covered on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-36,-47, right,4), so same, unsafe for T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (60,49, right,4) and (12,1, right,4)\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,4), span at T: [49 + 4(T-3), 60 + 4(T-3)]\n\n0 in span? 49 + 4(T-3) <= 0 <= 60 + 4(T-3)\n\nFirst: 49 + 4(T-3) <= 0 => 4(T-3) <= -49, impossible since T-3 >=0, 4(T-3) >=0, 49>0, so never <=0.\n\nSecond part: 0 <= 60 + 4(T-3) always true for T>=3.\n\nBut since first inequality false, 0 not in [49,60] for any T, so this car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1, right,4), span [1 + 4(T-3), 12 + 4(T-3)]\n\n0 in [1 +4(T-3), 12 +4(T-3)]\n\n1 +4(T-3) <= 0 <= 12 +4(T-3)\n\nFirst: 1 +4(T-3) <=0 => 4(T-3) <= -1, impossible.\n\nSecond: 0 <=12 +4(T-3) always true.\n\nSo 0 never in span for this car either. So on y=3, no car covers 0 at any time? But at T=3, span [1,12] and [49,60], both away from 0.\n\nFor example, at T=3, min position is 1, which is >0, so 0 not covered. And as time increases, positions increase, so always above 0, so y=3 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nCar 1: positions from 49+4(T-3) to 60+4(T-3), which at T=3 is 49 to 60, all positive, increasing, so always >0.\n\nCar 2: 1+4(T-3) to 12+4(T-3), at T=3:1 to12, all positive, increasing, so min at T=3 is 1>0, so 0 never covered. Yes, y=3 is always safe.\n\nBut we start at T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: similar to freeway 3, cars (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4), same as y=3, so always safe, 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same cars, (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4), same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (-60,-25, left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at T: [h - s(T-3), τ - s(T-3)] = [-60 -36(T-3), -25 -36(T-3)]\n\nh=-60, τ=-25, direction left.\n\nFrom update: left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-3), τ - s(T-3)] = [-60 -36(T-3), -25 -36(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36(T-3) <= 0 <= -25 -36(T-3)\n\nSince the car is moving left, positions decreasing.\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36(T-3) <= 0\n\n-36(T-3) <= 60\n\nMultiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-3) >= -60\n\nBut -60 is negative, T-3 >=0, so 36(T-3) >=0 > -60, so always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -36(T-3)\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-3)\n\nThis is -25 -36(T-3) >=0\n\n-36(T-3) >= 25\n\nMultiply by -1: 36(T-3) <= -25\n\nBut 36(T-3) >=0, -25<0, so impossible.\n\nThus, 0 never in the span for this car. Because the span is from a large negative to less negative, but both negative, so 0 not covered.\n\nFor example, at T=3, span [-60, -25], both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, positions decrease, so more negative, never reach 0. So y=6 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4), span [49 +4(T-3), 60 +4(T-3)], always positive, min 49>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4), span [13 +4(T-3), 24 +4(T-3)], at T=3: [13,24], always positive, increasing, so 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,4), span [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] = [-23 +4(T-3), -12 +4(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +4(T-3) <= 0 <= -12 +4(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +4(T-3) <=0 => 4(T-3) <=23 => T-3 <= 23/4=5.75 => T<=8.75, so T<=8\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +4(T-3) => 12 <=4(T-3) => 3 <= T-3 => T>=6\n\nSo 0 in span when T>=6 and T<=8, i.e., T=6,7,8.\n\nFor T=6,7,8, this car covers 0 on y=7.\n\nOther cars don't cover, so y=7 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (-36,-47,right,4) same as y=1 and y=2.\n\n(-36,-47,right,4), span [ -47 +4(T-3), -36 +4(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span when -47 +4(T-3) <=0 <= -36 +4(T-3)\n\nFirst: -47 +4(T-3)<=0 => 4(T-3)<=47 => T-3<=11.75 => T<=14.75, T<=14\n\nSecond: 0<= -36 +4(T-3) => 36<=4(T-3) => 9<=T-3 => T>=12\n\nSo T=12,13,14 unsafe for y=8.\n\nNow, summarize safe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=12,13,14; else safe\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe T=12,13,14; else safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe (similar to y=3)\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe T=6,7,8; else safe\n\ny=8: unsafe T=12,13,14; else safe\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, but we start at y=3, end at y=9.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 at T=3 to y=9 at some T=3+H.\n\nMinimum H=6, so arrive at T=9.\n\nCheck the path with all up moves.\n\nStart T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: move up to y=4 at T=4? After action at T=3, y_{4} = y_3 + Δy, if a_3=U, y_4 =4.\n\nAt turn T=4, player is on y=4.\n\ny=4 is always safe, as above.\n\nAction at T=4: U, then y_5=5.\n\nT=5, on y=5, safe.\n\nAction U, y_6=6.\n\nT=6, on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U, y_7=7.\n\nT=7, on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=7, y=7, unsafe! Collision.\n\nBecause at T=7, on y=7, and y=7 unsafe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at T=6 or T=8, also unsafe.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=7, we are on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision if we move up directly at T=7.\n\nNow, T=6: if we were on y=7 at T=6, also unsafe.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at T=6 we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen after action U at T=6, we go to y_7=7 at turn T=7.\n\nAt T=7, we are on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at T=6,7, or 8.\n\nWith min path, we would be on y=7 at T=7 if we start at T=3 y=3, and move up each turn:\n\nT=3: y=3\n\na=U, T=4: y=4\n\na=U, T=5: y=5\n\na=U, T=6: y=6\n\na=U, T=7: y=7 → unsafe\n\na=U, T=8: y=8\n\nBut at T=8, y=8, is it safe? y=8 unsafe at T=12,13,14, not at T=8, so at T=8, y=8 should be safe? y=8 unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so at T=8, it is safe.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, we get stuck at T=7.\n\nIf we go to y=7 later or earlier.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe from T=6 to T=8, we need to be on y=7 before T=6 or after T=8.\n\nT=6,7,8 unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo safe times for y=7 are T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, we start at T=3, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to delay or advance when we are on y=7.\n\nBut since we can only move one step per turn, we need to adjust.\n\nFirst, the direct path in 6 moves: arrive at T=9 with y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=9, we must have been at y=8 at T=8, and action U at T=8 to go to y=9 at T=9.\n\nAt T=8, if we are on y=8, it is safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at T=8, we need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo from y=7 at T=7.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nConflict.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=9:\n\nAt T=9, y=9, safe.\n\nTo get there, at T=8, we must have y_8, and action U to go to y_9=9.\n\nSo y_8 must be 8, since U increases to 9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, we are on y=8, which must be safe.\n\ny=8 is safe at T=8, since unsafe only T=12-14.\n\nNow, at T=8, y=8, how did we get there? From T=7, y_7, with action U or S or D.\n\nIf we moved U from y_7=7 to y_8=8.\n\nBut at T=7, we are on y=7, which is unsafe at T=7.\n\nIf we moved S, from y_7=7 to y_8=7, but then at T=8, y=7, which is still unsafe (since unsafe T=6,7,8).\n\nThen at T=8, if y=7, unsafe, and we need to move to y=8 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=9, we need y_8=8 or 9, but if y_8=9, we are done earlier, but let's see.\n\ny_8 could be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, then action U to y_9=9.\n\nIf y_8=9, then action S or something, but we can be done.\n\nBut min time, probably y_8=8 then U.\n\nBut at T=7, if we are on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe can be on y=7 at T=5 or earlier, or at T=9 or later.\n\nT=5 is before, T=9 is later.\n\nNow, we start at T=3, y=3.\n\nWe can move slower or faster.\n\nFirst, let's list the times we need to be on each row if moving directly, but with delay.\n\nSince y=3,4,5,6 are always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\ny=8 is safe except T=12-14, but T=8 is early, safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe T=6-8.\n\nWe need to cross y=7 when it is safe, i.e., not at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo at T=5 or before, or T=9 or after.\n\nBut T=5 is turn 5, we are at T=3, so we can reach y=7 by T=5 if we move up quickly.\n\nFrom T=3 y=3 to y=7: need to increase by 4, so can be at y=7 as early as T=7? Let's see.\n\nAt T=3, y=3\n\nAfter actions: at time T, y_T.\n\nTo be at y=7 at time T, we need to have increased by 4 from start.\n\nSince we start at T=3 y=3, after k up moves, y_{3+k} =3+k.\n\nSet y_T = T - 3 + 3? At time T, y_T.\n\ny_3 =3\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy3\n\nIf we always move up, y_T = 3 + (T-3) for T>=3.\n\ny_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nIf Δy=1 each time, y_T = 3 + (T-3) for T=3,4,5,...\n\nSo at T, y= T - 3 + 3 = T? y_3=3, y_4=4, y_5=5, y_6=6, y_7=7, etc.\n\nSo at time T, y=T for T from 3 to 9? y_3=3, y_4=4, ..., y_7=7, y_8=8, y_9=9.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at safe time, e.g., T=5 or T=9.\n\nT=5: y_5=7? But at T=5, if y_5=7, but from start, at T=3 y=3, to T=5 y=7, that requires two moves: from T=3 to T=4, y to 4 or5, etc.\n\nAt T=3, y=3\n\nAfter one action: at T=4, y=4 if U, or 3 if S, or 2 if D.\n\nSimilarly, after two actions: at T=5, y could be 3,4,5, or 2,3,4, etc., depending on actions.\n\nTo have y_5=7, we need to have moved up 4 times in two turns? Impossible, since max move is +1 per turn.\n\nMax y at T=5: from T=3 to T=4: U to y=4, then T=4 to T=5: U to y=5. So y_5=5 max.\n\nCannot be y=7 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, min y=1 or something, but not relevant.\n\nAt T=5, y can be from 1 to 5, I think, but not 7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, y could be up to 9.\n\nBut y=7 at T=9: if we delay.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9, not stay at y=7.\n\nTo cross y=7 safely, we need to be on y=7 at a safe time, i.e., T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut T<=5: at T=5, max y=5, as above, so y=7 not possible at T<=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y<=4, etc.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=7 is T=7, with all up moves: y_7=7.\n\nBut T=7 is unsafe.\n\nWith slower moves, later, but y=7 at T=7 is earliest possible.\n\nAt T=6, y=6 max; T=7, y=7 max.\n\nSo y=7 cannot be achieved before T=7.\n\nNow, after T=8, we can be at y=7 later.\n\nFor example, at T=9, we can be at y=7 if we moved down or stayed.\n\nBut we want to go to y=9, so we might not need to be on y=7 at all if we go directly, but we have to pass through y=7 to go to y=8, unless we jump, but we move step by step.\n\nTo go from y=6 to y=8, we must go through y=7 at some point.\n\nWhen we move from y=6 to y=7, we are on y=7 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7 to y=8.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 for at least one turn when moving up.\n\nUnless we stay on y=6 and then go directly to y=8, but we can only change by 1, so we must visit y=7.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at some turn T, and at that T, it must be safe, so T not 6,7,8.\n\nBut T cannot be <=5, as y=7 impossible before T=7.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=7 at T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, T=9 or later.\n\nNow, we start at T=3, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nMinimal T for y=9 is T=9 with all up, but we have delay at y=7.\n\nSo we need to arrive later.\n\nLet us be on y=7 at T=9 or later.\n\nFirst, safe for y=7 at T=9: since unsafe T=6,7,8, so T=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=10, etc.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want the earliest possible arrival at y=9.\n\nSince we must be on y=7 at T>=9, the earliest is T=9.\n\nSo let us be on y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 at T=9.\n\nWe start at T=3, y=3.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=7 in 6 turns? From T=3 to T=9 is 6 turns? Time from T=3 to T=9 is 6 steps: actions at T=3 to T=8, to reach position at T=9.\n\nNumber of actions to go from start to turn T.\n\nFrom time T=3 to time T=9, there are 6 actions: at T=3,4,5,6,7,8 to determine y at T=9.\n\ny_9 depends on actions from T=3 to T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y at time T is after actions up to T-1.\n\nWe want y_9 =9.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=9, we need y_9=7.\n\nBut we want y_9=9, not 7.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at T=9, then we can go to y=8 at T=10, etc., but that would be later.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 earlier than T=9, but we can't before T=7, and T=7,8 unsafe, so T=9 is first possible.\n\nBut at T=9, we can be at y=7, then move up to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11, so arrive at T=11.\n\nBut min with no delay is T=9, so H=6 actions? Let's see.\n\nOriginal: with H actions, we arrive at time t1 + H.\n\nt1=3, arrive at 3+H.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nStart y_3=3.\n\nIf all up, y_{3+H} =3+H, so for y=9, 3+H=9, H=6, arrive at T=9.\n\nBut with obstacle, we may need more turns.\n\nSince we must be on y=7 at safe time, earliest T=9.\n\nSo at T=9, we can be at y=7.\n\nThen from there, to go to y=9, need two more up moves.\n\nSo arrive at T=11 with y=9.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=9, if we can be at y=9 directly, but to be at y=9 at T=9, we need to have moved faster, but impossible since max y at T=9 is 9, but to be at y=9 at T=9, with all up, but we have the y=7 problem.\n\nAt T=9, y=9 is possible only if we were at y=8 at T=8 and moved up.\n\nBut at T=8, if we are on y=8, it is safe, but to be on y=8 at T=8, we need to come from y=7 at T=7 or something.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at T=7.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=8 at T=8 by moving from y=7, because to move from y=7 to y=8 at turn T=8, we need to be on y=7 at T=8 to take action U, but at T=8, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are on y=8 at T=8 directly, but how? From below, we must come from y=7 or y=9.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo it is impossible to be on y=8 at T=8, because to be there, we must have been on y=7 at T=7 or T=8 and moved, but both unsafe times for y=7.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn T, at turn T we are on y=7, take action U, go to y_{T+1}=8.\n\nBut at turn T, we are on y=7, so if T=7 or T=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or move down, but to be on y=8, we must have arrived from y=7 or above.\n\nBut since we start below, from y=7.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at T=8 without having been on y=7 at an unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be on y=8 is after T=8.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, earliest safe is T=9.\n\nSo let's plan to be on y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen we can go to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nArrive at T=11.\n\nNow, from start to T=9 at y=7.\n\nStart T=3 y=3.\n\nNeed to reach y=7 at T=9.\n\nThe difference in y: from 3 to 7, increase by 4.\n\nNumber of turns from T=3 to T=9: 6 actions (at T=3 to T=8) to reach y at T=9.\n\nWe have 6 actions to increase y by 4, so we can have some stay actions or even down, but to minimize time, probably stay or slow down.\n\nSince we have extra time, we can have two stay actions in between.\n\nFor example, from T=3 to T=9, 6 actions, need net +4 in y, so we can have four U and two S, for example.\n\nThen y from 3 to 7 in 6 turns.\n\nNow, we need to place these actions so that we don't have issues with other rows, but other rows are always safe except the times we care.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6 are always safe at all times, as per earlier.\n\ny=3,4,5,6 always safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe only at T=12-14, which is later than T=9, so not a problem.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe later.\n\nSo for T<=9, only y=7 has unsafe times, but we are not on y=7 until T=9.\n\nIn the path to T=9 y=7, we are on y=3,4,5,6 which are safe.\n\nSo we can go directly with some stays.\n\nFor example, we can move up most of the way but stay twice to delay.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=9.\n\nSince we start at y=3 T=3.\n\nIf we move up immediately, we can be at y=6 at T=6, for example.\n\nT=3 y=3\n\na=U, T=4 y=4\n\na=U, T=5 y=5\n\na=U, T=6 y=6\n\nNow at T=6, y=6, safe.\n\nWe need to stay or move until T=9 to be at y=7? At T=9 y=7.\n\nFrom T=6 y=6, we can stay for two turns or move down, but better to stay.\n\nActions:\n\nAt T=6, we can do S, then T=7 y=6 (still)\n\nThen at T=7, if we do S, T=8 y=6\n\nThen at T=8, do U? But we need y_9=7.\n\ny_9 depends on action at T=8.\n\nIf at T=8 we do U, and y_8=6, then y_9=7.\n\nBut at T=8, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nThen y_9=7.\n\nBut we want to be at y=7 at T=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=9, y=7.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut at T=7 and T=8, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, at T=9, y=7, safe because T=9 >=9, not unsafe.\n\nThen from there, action at T=9: U, to y_{10}=8\n\nAt T=10, on y=8.\n\nNow y=8 is safe at T=10? y=8 unsafe at T=12,13,14, so T=10 is safe.\n\nThen action at T=10: U, to y_{11}=9\n\nAt T=11, on y=9, which is safe and goal.\n\nSo we arrived at T=11.\n\nNow, actions: from T=3 to T=10, we have actions for t=0 to 7? Let's list.\n\nt1=3.\n\nActions for t=0 to H-1, times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWe arrive at time t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, we arrive at T=11, so t1 + H =11, t1=3, so H=8.\n\nActions at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 =3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nWith the sequence:\n\nAt T=3: action? Start at y=3.\n\nTo reach y=7 at T=9, and we have to specify actions.\n\nIn the plan above:\n\nT=3: y=3, we need to move, but to delay, we might not move up immediately.\n\nIn the sequence I thought:\n\nAt T=3: say action S, so y_4 = y_3 +0 =3? Action at T=3 determines y_4.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1}.\n\nStandard: at start of turn T, position y_T, choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, we are on y_T, check collision.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn T=3: y_3=3, safe. We can choose a_3.\n\nIf a_3 = S, then y_4 =3\n\nIf a_3 = U, y_4=4, etc.\n\nIn the path to y_9=7:\n\nWe need y_9=7.\n\ny_9 depends on actions from T=3 to T=8.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\n...\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_3=3\n\nSo y_9 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 8} Δy_t\n\n= 3 + number of U minus number of D from t=3 to 8.\n\nSince we want y_9=7, so 3 + U_count - D_count =7, so U_count - D_count =4.\n\nFrom T=3 to T=8, 6 actions (t=3,4,5,6,7,8), each can be U,D,S.\n\nNet +4, so U_count - D_count =4.\n\nSince S has Δy=0.\n\nTo minimize time, but we are delaying, so we might have S or D to waste time.\n\nBut with net +4 in 6 actions, we can have, for example, 4 U and 2 S, or 5 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nBut since we want to be safe, and rows below are safe, we can do the stays early or late.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nAt T=3: action U, then y_4=4\n\nT=4: action U, y_5=5\n\nT=5: action U, y_6=6\n\nNow at T=6: y_6=6, safe. Action? We need to have y_9=7, so from here, we need to increase by only 1 in three actions? From T=6 to T=9.\n\ny_6=6\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nWe want y_9=7.\n\nSo 6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 =7, so Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 =1.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSo sum=1, possible with one U and two S, or one U, one D, one S but net zero? Sum of Δy =1.\n\nFor example, two S and one U: if Δy_6=0, Δy_7=0, Δy_8=1, then y_9=6 +0+0+1=7.\n\nOr Δy_6=1, Δy_7=0, Δy_8=0, then y_7=7, y_8=7, y_9=7.\n\nBut if y_7=7, at turn T=7, we are on y=7, which is unsafe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=7, at T=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, in the sequence from T=6, we must not be on y=7 until T=9.\n\nSo at T=6, we are on y=6.\n\nIf we do U at T=6, then y_7=7, and at T=7, we are on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at T=6, y_7=6\n\nThen at T=7, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen if we do U at T=7, y_8=7, and at T=8, on y=7, unsafe (since T=8 unsafe for y=7).\n\nIf we do S at T=7, y_8=6, then at T=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, if we do U, y_9=7, and at T=9, on y=7, safe.\n\nThis works.\n\nActions:\n\nT=6: action S, so y_7 =6\n\nAt turn T=7: position y_7=6, safe (y=6 always safe). Action: S, so y_8=6\n\nAt turn T=8: position y_8=6, safe. Action: U, so y_9=7\n\nAt turn T=9: position y_9=7, safe (T=9 not unsafe time).\n\nThen from here, we go up.\n\nT=9: action U, so y_{10}=8\n\nAt turn T=10: position y_{10}=8, now y=8 at T=10, safe (unsafe only T=12-14). Action U, so y_{11}=9\n\nAt turn T=11: position y_{11}=9, safe, goal.\n\nNow, we need the actions from T=3 onwards.\n\nAt T=3: we need to get to y=6 at T=6.\n\nStart T=3 y=3.\n\nTo have y_6=6.\n\nWith actions at T=3,4,5.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_3=3\n\nWant y_6=6, so 3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 =6, so Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 =3.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, must have all three actions U: Δy=1 each.\n\nSo actions:\n\nT=3: U, y_4=4\n\nT=4: U, y_5=5\n\nT=5: U, y_6=6\n\nThen as above.\n\nNow, full sequence:\n\nTurn T=3: position y=3, safe. Action a_3=U, so y_4=4\n\nTurn T=4: position y=4, safe. Action a_4=U, so y_5=5\n\nTurn T=5: position y=5, safe. Action a_5=U, so y_6=6\n\nTurn T=6: position y=6, safe. Action a_6=S, so y_7=6 (stay)\n\nTurn T=7: position y=6, safe. Action a_7=S, so y_8=6 (stay)\n\nTurn T=8: position y=6, safe. Action a_8=U, so y_9=7\n\nTurn T=9: position y=7, safe (T=9). Action a_9=U, so y_{10}=8\n\nTurn T=10: position y=8, safe. Action a_{10}=U, so y_{11}=9\n\nAt T=11, y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=10, that's 8 actions: a_3 to a_{10}.\n\nH=8, arrive at T=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nEarlier I thought min H=6, but not possible due to obstacle.\n\nCan we reach y=9 faster than T=11?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at T=9, then go to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11, same.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=10, for example.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nThen y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, and y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then action U at T=9.\n\nIf y_9=9, action S or something.\n\nBut y_9 must be safe.\n\ny_9=8 or 9.\n\nBut to have y_9=8, we need to be on y=8 at T=9.\n\nBut y=8 at T=9 is safe.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at T=9, we must come from y=7 or y=9.\n\nIf from y=7 at T=9, but at T=9, if we are on y=7, we take action to go to y=8.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at T=9, we need to arrive there at turn T=9.\n\nAt turn T=9, position y_9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then we are on y=8 at T=9.\n\nHow did we get y_9=8?\n\nFrom y_8 and action at T=8.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf y_9=8, then y_8 + Δy_8 =8.\n\ny_8 could be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y_8=7, then Δy_8=1 (U)\n\nBut at T=8, if y_8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=8, then Δy_8=0 (S)\n\nThen at T=8, on y=8, safe.\n\nIf y_8=9, then Δy_8=-1, but we are going up, not down.\n\nBut to have y_9=8, if y_8=8, S, or y_8=7,U but unsafe, or y_8=9,D down.\n\nBut we don't want to go down.\n\nNow, similarly, y_8 must be set.\n\nTo have y_8=8 without being on y=7 at unsafe time.\n\ny_8=8: must have come from y=7 at T=7 or earlier, but T=7 unsafe.\n\nEarliest safe for y=7 is T=9, so at T=8, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 if it requires previous unsafe.\n\nAt T=8, we can be on y=8 only if we were on y=8 at T=7 or moved from y=7 or y=9.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at T=8, if we moved from y=7 at T=8, we are on y=7 at T=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we were on y=8 at T=7, then y_7=8, but to be at y=7 at T=7, unsafe? y_7=8 means at T=7 we are on y=8.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at T=7.\n\nFrom below, must go through y=7.\n\nAt T=6, y=6, action U to y_7=7, but at T=7, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we move directly, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at T=8 or earlier without being on y=7 at unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, earliest we can be on y=8 is T=10, for example.\n\nAt T=9, we can be on y=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action U to y_{10}=8.\n\nThen at T=10, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen action U to y_{11}=9.\n\nArrive T=11.\n\nIf we go faster to higher y earlier, but we have to pass y=7.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=5, y=5 (max), then we can stay or something, but still, to go to y=6 at T=6, then we need to go to y=7 at some point.\n\nIf we go to y=6 at T=6, then we have to stay until T=8 to go to y=7 at T=9, as before.\n\nNo shorter way.\n\nPerhaps we can move down to avoid, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, go down to y=2 or something, but y=2 has unsafe times later, but we are at early times, safe, but going down increases distance, so more turns, worse.\n\nSo the above path with H=8 actions seems minimal.\n\nH=8 actions from t1=3 to t1+7=10, arrive at t1+8=11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from T=3 to T=10.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions starting from turn t1=3.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nTurn t1: T=3, action U\n\nTurn t1+1: T=4, action U\n\nTurn t1+2: T=5, action U\n\nTurn t1+3: T=6, action S\n\nTurn t1+4: T=7, action S\n\nTurn t1+5: T=8, action U\n\nTurn t1+6: T=9, action U\n\nTurn t1+7: T=10, action U\n\nAfter that, at T=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=8.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt T=6: position y=6, safe.\n\nAction S, so y_7=6\n\nAt T=7: position y=6, safe (y=6 always safe)\n\nAction S, y_8=6\n\nAt T=8: position y=6, safe\n\nAction U, y_9=7\n\nAt T=9: position y=7, now T=9, which is not in unsafe {6,7,8}, so safe.\n\nThen action U, y_{10}=8\n\nAt T=10: position y=8, T=10 not in {12,13,14}, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{11}=9\n\nAt T=11: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7?\n\nSuppose H=7, arrive at T=10 with y=9.\n\nThen actions at T=3 to T=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nSet y_{10}=9, so y_9 + Δy_9 =9.\n\ny_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then Δy_9=1 (U)\n\nIf y_9=9, Δy_9=0 (S)\n\ny_9 must be safe.\n\ny=8 or 9 at T=9.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\ny=8 at T=9 safe.\n\nTo have y_9=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=9, then we are at goal at T=9, but with H=7 actions? Actions from T=3 to T=9, that's 7 actions, arrive at T=10.\n\ny_{10} =9.\n\nIf y_9=9, then action at T=9 must be S to keep y_{10}=9, but we can arrive earlier.\n\nBut y_9=9 at T=9.\n\nTo have y_9=9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_9=9, so y_8 + Δy_8 =9.\n\ny_8 could be 8,9,10 but y<=9, so y_8=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, Δy_8=1\n\nIf y_8=9, Δy_8=0\n\ny_8 must be safe.\n\nNow, to have y_8=8 or 9.\n\nBut y_8=8 requires being on y=8 at T=8 or moving from y=7.\n\nBut at T=8, y=7 unsafe, so cannot move from y=7 to y=8 at T=8.\n\nIf y_8=8 directly, but must come from y=7 earlier.\n\nEarliest y=7 safe is T=9, but T=9 is after T=8.\n\nAt T=8, if y_8=8, how?\n\nIf we were on y=8 at T=7, then y_7=8.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=7, unsafe, to go to y=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to have y_8=8 or y_8=9 without passing through unsafe y=7.\n\nThus, minimal arrival is at T=11 with H=8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we used two stays at T=6 and T=7.\n\nWe could have stayed earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we could stay, but that might delay more, but since we need to arrive at T=11 anyway, it might not save time.\n\nSuppose we stay at T=3: action S, y_4=3\n\nThen T=4: U, y_5=4\n\nT=5: U, y_6=5\n\nT=6: U, y_7=6? y_6=5, U to y_7=6\n\nThen T=7: need to stay, etc., same as before, but we start later, so y_6=6 at T=7? Let's see.\n\nT=3: S, y_4=3\n\nT=4: U, y_5=4\n\nT=5: U, y_6=5\n\nT=6: U, y_7=6\n\nNow at T=7: y=6, same as before, then S, S, U to y_9=7, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut now actions: T=3 to T=10, same number, but we have an extra stay at beginning, so we might reach y=6 later, but in this case, at T=7 we are at y=6, whereas previously at T=6 y=6.\n\nBut then from T=7 y=6, we need to stay or move to have y_9=7.\n\nIf at T=7: S, y_8=6\n\nT=8: S, y_9=6? Then need U to y_{10}=7, later.\n\nTo have y_9=7.\n\nAt T=7: y=6, if U, y_8=7, but at T=8, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y_8=6\n\nThen at T=8: U, y_9=7\n\nAt T=9, y=7 safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we arrived at y=7 at T=9, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nt1=3.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter action at T=10, at T=11 y=9.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t1+H-1=3+7=10, and arrive at t1+H=11.\n\nIn the output, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = U for T=3\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U for T=4\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +7: U for T=10\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from T=3 to T=10.\n\nt from 0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if at any point we are on a row with collision, but we checked.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we move, we are not on the new row yet.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=6 to y=7 at T=8, action U at T=8, we are on y=6 at T=8, take action, go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=6, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 has a car that covers 0 at T=6,7,8, which we avoided.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? Suppose we go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nThen y_{10}=9.\n\nNow, y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nSet y_{10}=9, so y_9 + Δy_9 =9.\n\ny_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nCase 1: y_9=8, then Δy_9=1 (U)\n\nThen at T=9, position y_9=8, safe.\n\nBut y_9=8, how?\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_9=8, so y_8 + Δy_8 =8.\n\ny_8 could be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y_8=7, then Δy_8=1, but at T=8, if y_8=7, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=8, Δy_8=0, then at T=8, y=8 safe.\n\nIf y_8=9, Δy_8=-1, not desirable.\n\nSo possible if y_8=8 and Δy_8=0.\n\nThen y_9=8.\n\nThen we need y_8=8 at T=8.\n\ny_8=8, at T=8 safe.\n\nHow to get y_8=8.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\ny_8=8, so y_7 + Δy_7 =8.\n\ny_7 could be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y_7=7, Δy_7=1, but at T=7, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf y_7=8, Δy_7=0, then at T=7, y=8, which is safe? y=8 unsafe only at T=12-14, so T=7 safe.\n\nIf y_7=9, Δy_7=-1, not good.\n\nSo if y_7=8 and Δy_7=0, then y_8=8.\n\nBut y_7=8 at T=7.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at T=7.\n\ny_7=8.\n\nNow, from start, T=3 y=3 to T=7 y=8.\n\nIncrease by 5 in 4 turns? Actions at T=3,4,5,6 to determine y_7.\n\ny_7 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 6} Δy_t = 3 + net change from 4 actions.\n\nMax y_7 = 3+4=7, if all U: y_4=4, y_5=5, y_6=6, y_7=7.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at T=7, since max y=7 at T=7.\n\ny_7 <=7, so y_7=8 impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y_7=8.\n\nThus, the only possibility is y_8=8 with y_7=7 or other, but y_7=7 unsafe, or y_7=8 impossible.\n\nSo cannot have y_8=8 without unsafe or impossible.\n\nHence, impossible to reach y=9 by T=10 with H=7.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7: U \\end{array} }\n\nWith t1=3.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn t1 +3 is T=6, action S\n\nt1+4 is T=7, action S\n\nt1+5 is T=8, action U\n\nt1+6 is T=9, action U\n\nt1+7 is T=10, action U\n\nYes.\n\nH=8.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at turns 6, 7, 8; safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; safe otherwise.\n\nThe direct path to reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 9 (with 6 up actions) is blocked because \\(y=7\\) is unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8.

Since it's right-moving, span at T is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving cars: span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nt1=6, so T-t1 is the offset.\n\nAlso, collision if y_T = k and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, starting from y_6 = 0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, and we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimum number of turns is at least 9, if we go up every turn. But we might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when a car's span includes 0 at a given turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care about when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, note that for right-moving cars, the span moves to the right, so if head and tail are both negative at t1, it will take some time for the span to cover 0.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t1 = T - 6.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-59 + 4*Δt, -48 + 4*Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4*Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4*Δt\n\nSo -59 + 4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so Δt <= 14 since turn integer.\n\nΔt integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT integer, Δt integer.\n\n-59 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 14.75, so Δt <= 14\n\n0 <= -48 + 4Δt => 48 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nΔt=12: -59 + 48 = -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, and 0 <= -48 + 48 =0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔt=13: -59+52= -7 <=0 true, 0<= -48+52=4, 0<=4 true.\n\nΔt=14: -59+56= -3 <=0 true, 0<= -48+56=8, 0<=8 true.\n\nΔt=15: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo on freeway 1, 0 covered at Δt=12,13,14, i.e., turns T=6+12=18, 19,20.\n\nT=18,19,20.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, head=-48,tail=-59,right,s=4, so same, 0 covered at T=18,19,20.\n\nFreeway 3: has two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, s=4? Head=48, tail=37, but for right-moving, if head=48, tail=37, that means tail is less than head? Typically for right, head is right end, tail left, so if head=48, tail=37, that's fine, span [37,48] at t1.\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [37 + 4*Δt, 48 + 4*Δt]\n\n0 in span? 37 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 4Δt\n\n37 + 4Δt <=0? 4Δt <= -37, but Δt >=0, left side positive, 37+4Δt >=37>0, so never <=0. So 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-11 + 4*Δt, 0 + 4*Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 0 + 4Δt\n\n0 <= 4Δt always true for Δt >=0\n\n-11 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <=11 => Δt <= 2.75, so Δt <=2\n\nBut also 0 <= 4Δt, always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo -11 +4Δt <=0 and 0 <=4Δt\n\nFirst: -11+4Δt <=0 => Δt <= 11/4=2.75, Δt<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=4Δt, Δt>=0, always true.\n\nSo for Δt=0,1,2\n\nΔt=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, 0 <=0 true.\n\nΔt=1: -11+4= -7<=0 true, 0<=4 true.\n\nΔt=2: -11+8= -3<=0 true, 0<=8 true.\n\nΔt=3: -11+12=1<=0? False.\n\nSo at Δt=0,1,2, i.e., turns T=6,7,8\n\nT=6,7,8\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car same as above, 0 never covered.\n\nSecond car same, covered at T=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 4: | 4 | (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4) | same as freeway 3.\n\nSo freeway 4 also has car covering 0 at T=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), so same as 3 and 4, covered at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head=48, tail=83? For left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, but if left-moving, and head=48, tail=83, that would mean head=48, tail=83, so at t1, span [48,83]? But for left-moving, it should be moving left, so if head=48, tail=83, tail>head, which might be inconsistent.\n\nCheck the notation.\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nAnd in the update: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nWith direction left, so h and τ, with h being the left end at t1?\n\nIn the example, for left-moving, it says: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nNow, if it's left-moving, and span moves left, so at t1, h is left end, τ is right end? But in the span, [h, τ], if h < τ, it would be increasing, but moving left, so positions decreasing.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined with head being the front when moving.\n\nIn the right-moving case, for freeway 1, head=-48, tail=-59, so head > tail since -48 > -59, and it's moving right, so head is right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head should be left end, so smaller number.\n\nBut here for freeway 6, head=48, tail=83, and direction left, so if head=48, tail=83, then head < tail, which is consistent for left-moving? 48 < 83, so left end is 48, right end is 83.\n\nThen span at t1: [48,83]\n\nMoving left, so at T, span [48 - 36*Δt, 83 - 36*Δt]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36*Δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36Δt <= 0 => 48 <= 36Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36Δt => 36Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <= 2\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2\n\nΔt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2? 83/36=2.305, floor is 2.\n\nBut Δt integer.\n\nFirst: 48 - 36Δt <= 0 => 36Δt >=48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so Δt >= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 83 - 36Δt => 36Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nThus Δt=2\n\nCheck: Δt=2, 48-72= -24 <=0 true, 0 <= 83-72=11, 0<=11 true.\n\nΔt=1: 48-36=12 <=0? 12<=0 false.\n\nΔt=3: 0 <=83-108= -25? 0<= -25 false.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=6+2=8\n\nSo freeway 6, 0 covered only at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 7: cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at T: [37+4Δt, 48+4Δt], both positive, min 37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, dir=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span? 1+4Δt <=0 <=12+4Δt\n\n1+4Δt <=0? 4Δt <= -1, impossible since Δt>=0, so never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 4Δt, -24 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4Δt <=0 <= -24 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -35+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4=8.75, Δt<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +4Δt => 24 <=4Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt=6,7,8\n\nΔt=6: -35+24= -11<=0 true, 0<= -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔt=7: -35+28= -7<=0 true, 0<= -24+28=4, 0<=4 true.\n\nΔt=8: -35+32= -3<=0 true, 0<= -24+32=8, 0<=8 true.\n\nΔt=9: -35+36=1<=0 false.\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 covered at Δt=6,7,8, T=12,13,14.\n\nT=6+6=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nSo covered at T=18,19,20.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, times when 0 is covered (unsafe to be on that freeway):\n\n- y=1: T=18,19,20\n\n- y=2: T=18,19,20\n\n- y=3: T=6,7,8\n\n- y=4: T=6,7,8\n\n- y=5: T=6,7,8\n\n- y=6: T=8\n\n- y=7: T=12,13,14\n\n- y=8: T=18,19,20\n\ny=6 has only T=8 unsafe.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at T=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is the top, and since no cars on y=9, it's always safe, I assume.\n\ny=0 to y=9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, we start at T=6, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 asap.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 9 moves to go from 0 to 9, all up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nThe sequence of actions determines the path and the times when we are on each y.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to choose actions for T=6,7,8,... until we reach y=9.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAfter action at T, we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of turn T, I think? Let's see.\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note the point: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat means at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T, so only cars on y_T matter at that turn.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, and after action, you go to y_{T+1}, which is your position at turn T+1.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at time T.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of y positions, starting y_6=0, ending at some y_{6+H-1}=9, with |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1, and for each t, when on y_t = k between 1 and 8, it must not be unsafe at time t.\n\nUnsafe times as above.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and must pass through y=1 to 8, but we can stay or move down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nMinimum turns: if no cars, we can go up each turn: y6=0, y7=1, y8=2, ..., up to y15=9, that's 10 turns? Let's see:\n\nT=6: y=0\n\nAfter action, T=7: y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at T=14, y=8? Sequence:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart T=6, y=0.\n\nAfter action a6, y7 = y6 + Δy, depending on a6.\n\nSimilarly, after a7, y8, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, suppose at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe last action is at T-1, which sets y_T.\n\ny_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nWe need y_T=9 for some T.\n\nThe smallest T is when we go up every step: from T=6 y=0, to T=7 y=1, T=8 y=2, ..., T=14 y=8, then at T=14, y=8, we need to go to y=9 at T=15.\n\nSo y15=9, with actions from T=6 to T=14, all U, 9 actions, H=9 turns? H is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, with y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=6, so actions a_{6} to a_{6+H-1}, and position after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9? Not.\n\nDefine.\n\nAt turn t1, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we get y_{t1 +1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1 +1}, y_{t1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we start at y_{t1} =0.\n\nSo the number of actions H to go from y_{t1} to y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, minimum H=9 if we go up every time.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{6 + H} =9\n\ny6=0, so to reach 9, need at least 9 steps up.\n\nBut with possible down or stay, H could be larger.\n\nNow, with cars, we need to avoid being on unsafe y at unsafe t.\n\nNow, list the unsafe (y,t) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor y=1: unsafe at t=18,19,20\n\nBut t=18,19,20 are future times.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: same, t=18,19,20\n\ny=3: unsafe t=6,7,8\n\ny=4: t=6,7,8\n\ny=5: t=6,7,8\n\ny=6: unsafe only t=8\n\ny=7: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe t=18,19,20\n\nNow, we start at t=6, y=0.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go through y=1 to 8 to reach 9.\n\nBut at t=6, y=3,4,5 are unsafe, since t=6 is unsafe for them.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 unsafe for y=3,4,5, t=8 unsafe for y=3,4,5,6.\n\nAlso, later times have unsafe for other rows.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe positions.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 are unsafe from t=6 to t=8, we cannot be on them during those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is unsafe only at t=8.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe at t=18,19,20, but since we start from y=0 and need to go up, we should pass y=1 and y=2 early, before t=18, since t=18 is far.\n\nt=18 is 12 turns after t=6, so we might be past that if we go fast.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14, which is closer.\n\nLet me list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor y=1: safe except t=18,19,20. Since t=18 is late, for early times, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 same.\n\ny=3: unsafe t=6,7,8, so safe for t<6 or t>8, but t starts from 6, so safe for t>=9.\n\nSimilarly y=4 and y=5 same, safe for t>=9.\n\ny=6: unsafe only t=8, so safe for t<8 or t>8, i.e., t<=7 or t>=9.\n\nt=8 unsafe, so safe at t=6,7,9,10,... but not t=8.\n\ny=7: unsafe t=12,13,14, so safe for t<12 or t>14, i.e., t<=11 or t>=15.\n\ny=8: unsafe t=18,19,20, so safe for t<18 or t>20, i.e., t<=17 or t>=21.\n\nWe start at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nThe critical part is between t=6 to t=8, where y=3,4,5 are unsafe, and y=6 is unsafe at t=8.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=6, we can go to y=1 at t=7, or stay at y=0.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should move up as soon as possible.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nAfter action a6, we go to y7.\n\ny7 can be 0 (if S), or 1 (if U), cannot go down since y=0 min.\n\nSimilarly, from y=0, actions: S or U, to stay or go up.\n\nNow, at t=7, we need to be at a safe y.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at t=7, is y=1 safe at t=7?\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=18,19,20, so at t=7, it is safe. Similarly y=2 safe.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 unsafe at t=7.\n\nSo at t=7, safe y are y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9? y=6 at t=7: y=6 safe at t<=7 or t>=9, t=7<=7, so safe. Similarly y=7 at t=7: y=7 unsafe only at t=12,13,14, so at t=7 safe.\n\nBut we are at low y, so options.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=3,4,5,6 unsafe? y=6 unsafe at t=8, and y=3,4,5 unsafe.\n\nSo safe at t=8: y=0,1,2,7,8,9? y=7 at t=8: unsafe only t=12,13,14, so safe at t=8. y=8 safe since t=8<18.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nOne way: go up directly, but at t=7, if we go to y=1, safe.\n\nAt t=8, we need to go to y=2 or stay or down, but to go up, y=2.\n\ny=2 safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=9, we can go to y=3, but y=3 safe only for t>=9, t=9 is >=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at t=8, if we are at y=2, safe.\n\nNow, the problem is that from t=6 to t=8, we cannot be on y=3,4,5, and at t=8, we cannot be on y=6.\n\nBut since we start low, we might not reach y=3 by t=9.\n\nLet's plan the path step by step.\n\nStart: t=6, y=0\n\nNow, action a6: can be S or U.\n\nIf U, then y7=1\n\nIf S, y7=0\n\nSince we want to go up, better to go U, to y7=1.\n\nt=7, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, at t=7, action a7: can go to y8=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y8 must be safe at t=8.\n\nPossible y8: 0,1,2 (since from y=1, can go down to 0, stay 1, up to 2)\n\nAll of these are safe at t=8: y=0,1,2 all safe at t=8.\n\nIf we go to y8=2, then at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action a8: can go to y9=1,2,3.\n\nNow, y9 must be safe at t=9.\n\ny=3 at t=9: since t=9>=9, safe.\n\ny=2 at t=9 safe, y=1 at t=9 safe.\n\nIf we go to y9=3, then at t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, but there are later constraints.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go up fast.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nt=6: y=0, a6=U → y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, a7=U → y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, a8=U → y9=3\n\nt=9: y=3, a9=U → y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, a10=U → y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, a11=U → y12=6\n\nNow at t=12, y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=12?\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=8, so at t=12>8, safe. Yes.\n\nBut now, we need to go to y=7.\n\nAt t=12, action a11? Let's index properly.\n\nAfter action at t=11, we have y12=6.\n\nNow at t=12, y=6, safe.\n\nAction a12: can go to y13=5,6, or7.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 at t=13? Collision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=13, then at t=13, we are on y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=13 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at t=13, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, if we are on y=7, unsafe.\n\nIn this path, at t=12, we are at y=6.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at t=13, then at t=13, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nWe could delay or something.\n\nAt t=12, y=6, safe.\n\nWe can choose to go to y=7 at t=13, but t=13 unsafe for y=7.\n\nGo to y=5 or stay y=6, but that delays.\n\nGo to y=7 later.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14, so safe only at t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nAt t=12, we are at y=6.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 for some turns until t=15, but that would take more turns.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe from t=12 to 14, we need to be on y=7 only at t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nt=11 is before, t=15 or later.\n\nIn the current path, at t=12, we are at y=6, which is after t=11.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=7 before t=15, because if we go at t=13,14,15? t=13 and 14 unsafe, t=15 safe.\n\nAt t=12, y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=13, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=6 until t=14, then at t=14, go to y=7? But t=14, if we are on y=7, unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=14.\n\nSo to be on y=7, must be at t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nt<=11: but at t=11, in the earlier path, we were at y=5? Let's see timeline.\n\nIn the fast up path:\n\nt=6: y=0\n\nt=7: y=1\n\nt=8: y=2\n\nt=9: y=3\n\nt=10: y=4\n\nt=11: y=5\n\nAt t=11, y=5, safe? y=5 unsafe only at t=6,7,8, so at t=11>8, safe.\n\nAction at t=11: a11, to y12=6, as before.\n\nBut at t=11, we are at y=5, we could go directly to y=6? From y=5, action to y=6, but that would be at t=12.\n\nAt t=11, y=5, action a11: if U, y12=6\n\nIf S, y12=5\n\nBut y=5 safe at t=11.\n\nTo reach y=7 safely, we need to be on y=7 at t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nBut at t=11, we are at y=5, so we can be at y=7 only at t=13 or later, which is after t=11, so t=13,14 unsafe, t=15 safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=7 is t=15.\n\nThus, from y=5 at t=11, we need to go to y=6 at some point, then to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=11, y=5.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, we need to stay at y=6 until we can go to y=7.\n\ny=7 safe at t=15.\n\nSo at t=12, y=6, we can stay: action S, so y13=6\n\nt=13, y=6, safe, action S, y14=6\n\nt=14, y=6, safe, action U to y15=7\n\nThen at t=15, y=7, now t=15>=15, safe.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut we lost some turns.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=14, we stayed at y=6 for three turns, then to y=7 at t=15.\n\nThen to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut y=8 has constraints.\n\nFirst, let's write the sequence so far.\n\nStart:\n\nt=6: y=0, a6=U → y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, a7=U → y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, a8=U → y9=3\n\nt=9: y=3, a9=U → y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, a10=U → y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, a11=U → y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6, a12=S → y13=6  (stay to avoid y=7 unsafe)\n\nt=13: y=6, a13=S → y14=6\n\nt=14: y=6, a14=U → y15=7\n\nt=15: y=7, a15=U → y16=8\n\nNow at t=16, y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=18,19,20, so at t=16<18, safe.\n\nThen action a15? t=15 action to y16=8.\n\nt=16: y=8, action a16: can go to y17=7,8,9\n\nIf go U to y17=9, then done.\n\nBut is y=9 safe? Yes, no cars.\n\nSo a16=U → y17=9\n\nThen we reach y=9 at t=17.\n\nt=17, y=9.\n\nNow, from start to end: started at t=6 y=0, ended at t=17 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a6 to a16, that's 11 actions? Let's list turns.\n\nActions: a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16 → 11 actions.\n\nH such that y_{6+H} =9.\n\ny6=0, y7=1, ..., up to y17=9, so from t=6 to t=17, that's 11 steps? t=6 to t=7 is one action, etc.\n\nPosition at turn T: after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=6, after 0 actions, at t=6.\n\nAfter first action a6, at t=7.\n\nAfter k actions, at t=6+k.\n\nWe want y_{6+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions.\n\nIn this case, y17=9, so 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nBut minimum is 9, so perhaps we can do better by not staying so long.\n\nEarlier we stayed from t=12 to t=14 at y=6, to avoid y=7 unsafe times.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 earlier? Only at t<=11, but at t=11 we were at y=5, which is too low.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher y earlier by not going up immediately.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, since y=3,4,5 are unsafe from t=6 to t=8, we might stay low or go to higher y directly, but we can only change by 1.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 or y=7 early, since they are safe at early times.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=0.\n\nWe can go to y=1 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, instead of going to y=2, we could go down or stay, but that seems worse.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=7, we can go to y=2 at t=8, as before.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nt=6: y=6 safe? At t=6, if we were on y=6, but we start at y=0, cannot be at y=6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y=6 safe.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=7, to reach y=6 at t=7 is impossible, since we can only move one step.\n\nSo we cannot jump.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=6, stay: a6=S, y7=0\n\nThen at t=7, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=1\n\nBut at t=8, y=1 safe.\n\nThen a8=U, y9=2\n\nThen same as before, but we delayed by one turn, worse.\n\nAt t=7, from y=0, go U to y8=1.\n\nt=8 y=1.\n\nThen we need to go to y=2, etc.\n\nBut we are behind.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=11, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=11, to be at y=7.\n\nSince y=7 safe at t=11.\n\nt=11 <=11, safe.\n\nNow, from start, how to reach y=7 by t=11.\n\nt=6: y=0\n\nt=7: at least y=1\n\nt=8: y=2 max? From t=7 y=1, can go to y=2 at t=8.\n\nt=9: y=3\n\nt=10: y=4\n\nt=11: y=5\n\nCannot reach y=7 by t=11, since from y=0 to y=7 in 5 steps? From t=6 to t=11 is 5 actions: a6 to a10, y11.\n\ny6=0, after a6 y7, a7 y8, ..., a10 y11.\n\nIn 5 actions, max y=5, if all U.\n\nSo at t=11, max y=5, cannot be at y=7.\n\nThus, impossible to be on y=7 at t=11 or earlier.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=7 at t=15 or later.\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nIn the previous path, we have to stay at y=6 from t=12 to t=14, then go to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=12, we are at y=6, and we stayed until t=14.\n\nt=12,13,14: three turns at y=6.\n\nBut we could go to y=7 later, but we have to wait until t=15.\n\nIs there a way to be at a higher position when waiting?\n\nFor example, after reaching y=5 or something.\n\nIn the path, at t=11 we are at y=5, we go to y=6 at t=12.\n\nBut y=5 is safe, we could stay at y=5 for some time.\n\nBut y=5 is safe after t=8, so at t=11,12,etc safe.\n\nBut if we stay at y=5, we are not progressing.\n\nWorse than staying at y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe except t=8, which is past.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=8 or something earlier, but we need to go through y=7.\n\nAnother thing: y=8 has unsafe at t=18,19,20, which is late, so if we reach early, no problem.\n\nIn the current plan, we go to y=8 at t=16, which is before t=18, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=17.\n\nNow, H=11 actions.\n\nBut can we reduce?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay all three turns at y=6.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14, so we need to avoid being on y=7 at those turns.\n\nBut we can be on other rows.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=12, instead of staying, we could go down to y=5 or up to y=7, but up to y=7 at t=13 is unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=5 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, y=5, safe.\n\nBut y=5 is lower, and we need to go back up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=12: y=6, a12=D → y13=5  (down to y=5)\n\nt=13: y=5, a13=U → y14=6? Or what.\n\nBut at t=14, if we are at y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=15.\n\nBut we went down and up, wasted actions.\n\nWorse than staying at y=6.\n\nGo to y=7 at t=15 directly from y=6 at t=14.\n\nIn the stay case, we have three actions: at t=12 S, t=13 S, t=14 U to y15=7.\n\nBut we could do fewer actions if we can reach y=7 at t=15 from elsewhere, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is unsafe from t=12 to 14, but y=8 might be an option? But to go to y=8, we need to be on y=7 first.\n\nUnless we can skip, but we can only move one step, so must go through y=7.\n\nSo no way around.\n\nPerhaps start by going to a different row early.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=0, go U to y7=1.\n\nt=7, y=1, instead of going to y=2, we could go down to y=0 or stay, but not helpful.\n\nOr go up to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is fine.\n\nThe only issue is the y=7 constraint.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nIn the initial path, we reached y=6 at t=12.\n\nt=12 is from the sequence: t=6:0, t=7:1, t=8:2, t=9:3, t=10:4, t=11:5, t=12:6.\n\nSo we reached y=6 at t=12.\n\nBut could we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we start at t=6 y=0, we go U to y7=1.\n\nAt t=7, go U to y8=2.\n\nAt t=8, we go U to y9=3, but at t=9 y=3, which is safe since t=9>=9.\n\nBut we cannot go faster because from y=0 to y=3 in 3 actions: t=6 to t=9, y=3.\n\nMinimum.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6, it would take 6 actions: from t=6 to t=12, y=6.\n\nt=6:0, t=7:1, t=8:2, t=9:3, t=10:4, t=11:5, t=12:6, yes 6 actions to y=6.\n\nSince we start at t=6 y=0.\n\nNo way to reach before t=12.\n\nThen we have to wait until t=15 to go to y=7.\n\nSo the waiting is necessary.\n\nBut in the path, we stayed at y=6 from t=12 to t=14, which is three turns, then y=7 at t=15.\n\nt=12,13,14 at y=6, so positions: t=12 y=6, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=6.\n\nThen t=15 y=7.\n\nWe could go to y=7 at t=15 from t=14 y=6.\n\nNow, back to y=8.\n\nAfter y=7 at t=15, we go U to y16=8 at t=16.\n\nThen U to y17=9 at t=17.\n\ny=8 at t=16 is safe, since t=16<18.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nNow, is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at t=15, but go to y=8 earlier? No.\n\nAnother point: at t=8, we are at y=2, and y=6 is safe at t=8? No, y=6 unsafe at t=8.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=6 at t=8 anyway.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 or y=8 at early times when they are safe.\n\nFor example, y=7 safe at t<=11.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=7 by t=11, as max y=5 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at t<=17, which we are at t=16<18.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the middle rows during unsafe times by taking a different path.\n\nFor example, at t=8, instead of going to y=3, we could stay at y=2 or go down.\n\nBut that would delay reaching higher rows.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=6: y=0, U to y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, U to y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, now at t=8, we could stay: a8=S, y9=2\n\nThen at t=9, y=2, go U to y10=3\n\nBut y=3 safe at t=10, etc., but we delayed by one turn, so reach y=6 later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, not helpful.\n\nGo down at some point, but worse.\n\nSo the initial path seems efficient except for the waiting at y=6.\n\nBut we have to wait somewhere.\n\nPerhaps we can wait at a different row.\n\nFor example, instead of going to y=6 and waiting, we could stay at y=5 for some time, but y=5 is lower, and we need to go to y=6 eventually, so it might take more turns.\n\nFor example: suppose at t=11, y=5, instead of going up, we stay: a11=S, y12=5\n\nt=12, y=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13, y=6, but now at t=13, we need to wait until t=15 to go to y=7.\n\nSo at t=13, y=6, we can stay: a13=S, y14=6\n\nt=14, y=6, a14=U, y15=7\n\nBut now we reached y=7 at t=15 same as before, but we stayed at y=5 at t=12? t=11 y=5, a11=S, y12=5 (t=12 position)\n\nThen a12=U, y13=6 (t=13)\n\nThen a13=S, y14=6 (t=14)\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\nCompared to original: original had y12=6, y13=6, y14=6, y15=7\n\nHere y12=5, y13=6, y14=6, y15=7, so we reached y=6 later, and y=7 same time, but we have an extra lower position, so it takes one more action to reach y=7? In this case, y15=7 same, but we used an action to stay at y=5, so more actions.\n\nOriginal: from t=11 y=5, a11=U to y12=6\n\nThen a12=S to y13=6, a13=S to y14=6, a14=U to y15=7\n\n4 actions to from y=5 at t=11 to y=7 at t=15.\n\nIn this alt: t=11 y=5, a11=S to y12=5, a12=U to y13=6, a13=S to y14=6, a14=U to y15=7, same number, but we are at y=5 for one turn, which is not progress, so same H to y=7.\n\nBut to reach y=9, same.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, in the sequence, we go to y=8 and y=9 later.\n\nBut in both cases, y=7 at t=15, then y16=8, y17=9.\n\nH same.\n\nBut in the alt, we have an extra turn at low y, but H to y=9 might be same or worse.\n\nIn original sequence, y17=9.\n\nIn alt sequence: let's list\n\nt=6:0 a6=U y7=1\n\nt=7:1 a7=U y8=2\n\nt=8:2 a8=U y9=3\n\nt=9:3 a9=U y10=4\n\nt=10:4 a10=U y11=5\n\nt=11:5 a11=S y12=5  (stay)\n\nt=12:5 a12=U y13=6\n\nt=13:6 a13=S y14=6  (or U? but cannot, since y=7 unsafe)\n\na13=S y14=6\n\nt=14:6 a14=U y15=7\n\nt=15:7 a15=U y16=8\n\nt=16:8 a16=U y17=9\n\nSame as before, y17=9, 11 actions.\n\nBut we have a stay at y=5, whereas original had all up to y=6 then stay.\n\nBut same H.\n\nTo save, we need to reduce waiting.\n\nBut we must wait until t=15 to be on y=7.\n\nSince we reach y=6 at t=12, we have to wait 3 turns: t=12,13,14 not on y=7.\n\nBut during these turns, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nWe could be at other rows, but since y=6 is safe and we need to be there to go up, it's fine.\n\nIf we go down, it might cost more.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on y=7 at t=15 directly.\n\nAnother thing: at t=14, we are at y=6, go U to y15=7.\n\nt=15 y=7 safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at t=18,19,20, t=16<18, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=17.\n\nNow, is there a constraint on y=8? Only at late times, so fine.\n\nBut we have y=8 at t=16, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster to y=8 or y=9, but no.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go to y=8 at t=16, we could go directly to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut minimum.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions.\n\nIn this sequence, we have:\n\nActions from a6 to a16.\n\na6: U\n\na7: U\n\na8: U\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: U  (to y12=6)\n\na12: S\n\na13: S\n\na14: U  (to y15=7)\n\na15: U  (to y16=8)\n\na16: U  (to y17=9)\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{6+H} =9, so 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nBut let's list the positions to verify safety.\n\nt=6: y=0, safe\n\nt=7: y=1, safe (y=1 unsafe only t=18-20)\n\nt=8: y=2, safe\n\nt=9: y=3, safe (t=9>=9)\n\nt=10: y=4, safe\n\nt=11: y=5, safe\n\nt=12: y=6, safe (t=12>8)\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\nt=14: y=6, safe\n\nt=15: y=7, safe (t=15>14)\n\nt=16: y=8, safe (t=16<18)\n\nt=17: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nCan we do with H=10?\n\nSuppose y_{16}=9.\n\nThen started from y6=0, in 10 actions, must have net +9, so all U, no down or stay.\n\nSequence: y6=0, y7=1, y8=2, y9=3, y10=4, y11=5, y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9? y_{6+H} = y_{16} for H=10.\n\ny_{16}=9.\n\nWith all U: after a6 U, y7=1; a7 U, y8=2; ... up to a15 U, y16=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=6: y=0 safe\n\nt=7: y=1 safe\n\nt=8: y=2 safe\n\nt=9: y=3 safe (t=9>=9)\n\nt=10: y=4 safe\n\nt=11: y=5 safe\n\nt=12: y=6 safe\n\nt=13: y=7? But y=7 at t=13 is unsafe! Because t=13 is one of the unsafe times for y=7.\n\nCollision would occur.\n\nIf we stay or something, but with all U, we must be at y=7 at t=13, which is unsafe.\n\nThus impossible with all U in 10 actions.\n\nWith H=10, we might have some down or stay, but net +9 in 10 actions, so we must have one down or stay, meaning we are at lower y at some point.\n\nFor example, suppose we have one stay or down.\n\nThen max y at t=13 would be less than 7.\n\ny12 must be at least 6 to reach y=9 by t=16? y16=9.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=16, 4 actions, can gain up to 4, so y12 must be at least 5.\n\nBut at t=13, if y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=13, we need y13 ≠7.\n\nSimilarly, y12 and y14.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose at t=13, we are not at y=7.\n\nPossible y13=6 or 8, but from y12, if y12=6, y13=5,6,7; if y12=7, y13=6,7,8, etc.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=13.\n\nIf y13=6, then we can go to y14=7, but t=14 y=7 unsafe.\n\ny13=8, but to reach y=8 at t=13, from y=0 in 7 actions, max y=7 at t=13? y6=0, after 7 actions y13.\n\ny13: after 7 actions, max y=7 if all U.\n\nBut y=7 at t=13 unsafe.\n\nIf we go slower, y13<7.\n\nThen to reach y=9 by t=16, from y13<7, say y13=6, then need to go to y16=9, in 3 actions, min y16=6+3=9 if all U, so possible.\n\nBut at t=14, if y14=7, but t=14 unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's try to set y13=6.\n\nThen y13=6 at t=13.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y16=9.\n\nActions: a13 to set y14, etc.\n\ny14 could be 5,6,7.\n\nIf y14=7, unsafe at t=14.\n\nSo cannot be y14=7.\n\nThus y14 must be 6 or 5 or something else.\n\nIf y14=6, then a14 to y15=5,6,7.\n\ny15=7 unsafe if t=15? t=15 y=7 safe.\n\nBut y15=7 at t=15 safe.\n\nThen y16=8, etc.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart from t=6.\n\nTo have y13=6.\n\ny6=0\n\nIn 7 actions, to y13=6.\n\nNet +6 in 7 actions, so we must have one down or stay.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up but with one delay.\n\nSay, t=6: y=0, a6=U y7=1\n\nt=7: y=1, a7=U y8=2\n\nt=8: y=2, a8=U y9=3\n\nt=9: y=3, a9=U y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, a10=U y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, now to have y13=6, we need to go from y11=5 to y13=6 in two actions.\n\ny12 could be 4,5,6.\n\nIf a11=S, y12=5, then a12=U, y13=6\n\nOr a11=D, y12=4, then a12=U, y13=5, not 6.\n\na11=U, y12=6, then y13=6 or something.\n\nBut we want y13=6.\n\nSo possible: at t=11, a11=S, y12=5\n\nThen t=12: y=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\nNow t=13: y=6, safe.\n\nNow we need y16=9.\n\nActions: a13, a14, a15 to set y14, y15, y16.\n\ny14 must not be 7, because if y14=7, t=14 unsafe.\n\nSo from y13=6, a13 can be D to y14=5, S to y14=6, or U to y14=7.\n\nBut U to y14=7 unsafe, so not.\n\nS to y14=6, or D to y14=5.\n\nIf S, y14=6\n\nThen a14 to y15=5,6,7.\n\ny15=7 at t=15 safe.\n\nThen a15=U to y16=8, but we need y16=9.\n\ny16=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf a14=U to y15=7, t=15 y=7 safe.\n\nThen a15=U to y16=8, still not 9.\n\ny16=8, but we need y16=9.\n\nTo reach y16=9 from y13=6 in three actions: max y16=6+3=9 if all U.\n\nBut if we go all U: a13=U to y14=7, but t=14 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go to y14=6 (by a13=S), then a14=U to y15=7 (t=15 safe), then a15=U to y16=8.\n\nBut y16=8, not 9. Need y16=9.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y17=9.\n\nBut with H=10, we want y16=9.\n\nHere y16=8, so not.\n\nAfter y13=6, if we go a13=D to y14=5, then a14=U to y15=6, a15=U to y16=7, worse.\n\nNot reaching.\n\nSuppose we have y13=7, but unsafe at t=13.\n\nCannot.\n\nOr y13=8, but impossible to reach from y=0 in 7 actions.\n\nMax y13=7.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nThus, impossible to have y16=9 with H=10 actions without collision.\n\nTherefore, minimum H=11.\n\nAnd the sequence I have is valid.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=14, we go from y=6 to y=7 at t=15.\n\nIn the action list.\n\nNow, for the output, we need to list actions starting from a6.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\na6: U\n\na7: U\n\na8: U\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: U  (to y12=6)\n\na12: S  (stay at y=6 for t=13? After a12, y13=y12 + Δy, if S, Δy=0, so y13=6)\n\nPosition after action.\n\nAfter a12, which is at turn t=12, we set y13.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t=6, action a6=U, then y7=1\n\nTurn t=7, action a7=U, y8=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t=14, action a14=U, then y15=7\n\nThen turn t=15, action a15=U, y16=8\n\nTurn t=16, action a16=U, y17=9\n\nNow, the last action is a16, and y_{t1 + H} = y_{6+H} = y17=9, so H=11.\n\nActions from a6 to a16.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is a6=U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = a7=U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 10: a_{t_1 +10} = a16=U\n\nt1=6, so actions from a6 to a_{6+10} = a16.\n\nH=11 actions, from t=0 to H-1=10, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + 10}\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to 10, that's 11 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence I have a12=S and a13=S, which are stay actions.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid staying? For example, if we can be on a different row during the waiting period, but since we need to be on y=6 to go up, and other rows might be unsafe or not helpful.\n\nFor instance, at t=12, from y=6, we could go down to y=5, but then at t=13 y=5, then we need to come back, costing extra actions.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, but in the car state, there is freeway 6 with a car, but we handled it.\n\nAnother thing: at t=8, y=6 is unsafe, but in our path, we are not on y=6 at t=8; we are at y=2.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nFor turn t=6 (t1): action U\n\nTurn t=7 (t1+1): action U\n\nTurn t=8 (t1+2): action U\n\nTurn t=9 (t1+3): action U\n\nTurn t=10 (t1+4): action U\n\nTurn t=11 (t1+5): action U  // to y12=6\n\nTurn t=12 (t1+6): action S  // stay, y13=6\n\nTurn t=13 (t1+7): action S  // stay, y14=6\n\nTurn t=14 (t1+8): action U  // to y15=7\n\nTurn t=15 (t1+9): action U  // to y16=8\n\nTurn t=16 (t1+10): action U  // to y17=9\n\nH=11, actions from t=0 to 10 relative to t1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6: we were on y=6 at t=12,13,14, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster by skipping some, but not possible.\n\nAnother point: the player can go down to y=0 and wait, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for a few turns, then go up later when rows are safe, but since y=3,4,5 are safe after t=8, we can go up from t=9, but starting later, so reach higher later.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=6, S, y7=0\n\nt=7, S, y8=0? Then at t=8, y=0, go U to y9=1, then t=9 y=1, U to y10=2, etc., much slower.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is H=11.\n\nThus, the action sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by staying at safe positions during unsafe times, particularly waiting at \\(y = 6\\) from turn 12 to 14 to avoid the unsafe period for \\(y = 7\\) at turns 12, 13, and 14.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 6\\), move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9 (safe since \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turns 6-8).\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13 (safe and avoids \\(y = 7\\) during unsafe turn 13).\n- At turn 13, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14 (safe and avoids \\(y = 7\\) during unsafe turn 14).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15 (safe since \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at turns 12-14).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16 (safe since \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at turns 18-20).\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17 (\\(t_1 + H = 6 + 11 = 17\\)) with no collisions, as verified against the car movement and unsafe times for each freeway.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, with y clamped between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=2 and want to go to y=9, we need to move up, so actions will mostly be U, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn. The player is on y_T at turn T, meaning that at the end of turn T, after moving, the position is (0, y_T), and that's when we check for collision on freeway y_T.\n\nImportant point: when you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are considered to be on y_T during turn T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So, if you move to a new freeway, you only check the car on the freeway you're leaving or staying on, not the one you're entering, until the next turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=8, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway at t=8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=-40, tail=-51, direction=right, speed=4. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? The notation says: for right-moving, [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head h=-40, tail τ=-51, direction right. But it says head and tail, and for right-moving, it should be increasing, so τ should be less than h? Here τ=-51, h=-40, so τ < h, yes, so [τ, h] = [-51, -40] at t_1.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-51 + 4(T-8), -40 + 4(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T, we need that for that y_T, 0 is not covered by any car on that row at that turn.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=2, turn t_1=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=9. y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars. Similarly y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, probably no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway and each turn when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince t_1=8, let t be the turn number relative to t_1, so at turn T = t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, where at turn t_1 + t, we take action a_{t_1+t}, then position at turn t_1 + t +1 is set? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, position is (0, y_T), then we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, with clamp to [0,9].\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1=8, position is (0,2), so we are on freeway 2 at turn 8, so we need to check if 0 is covered by cars on freeway 2 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each turn around t_1 when 0 is covered.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ is the offset from current turn.\n\nFor freeway k, we have cars, and for each car, we can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so for each freeway, we need the union of times when 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen for the player to be safe on freeway k at turn T, it must not be covered at that T.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-40, tail τ=-51, dir right, speed 4.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-51 + 4(τ), -40 + 4(τ)] where τ = T - t_1\n\nSet δ = T - t_1, so δ=0 at current turn.\n\nSpan: [-51 + 4δ, -40 + 4δ]\n\n0 is in this span if -51 + 4δ ≤ 0 ≤ -40 + 4δ\n\nSo -51 + 4δ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -40 + 4δ\n\nFirst inequality: -51 + 4δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4δ ≤ 51 ⇒ δ ≤ 51/4 = 12.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -40 + 4δ ⇒ 40 ≤ 4δ ⇒ δ ≥ 10\n\nSo δ between 10 and 12.75, since δ integer, δ=10,11,12\n\nδ=10: span [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\nδ=11: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4], -7 ≤ 0 ≤ 4, yes\n\nδ=12: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8], -3 ≤ 0 ≤ 8, yes\n\nδ=13: [-51+52, -40+52] = [1,12], 1 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 1? 0 not >=1, so 0 not in [1,12], no\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 covered at δ=10,11,12\n\nThat is turns T= t_1 +10, t_1+11, t_1+12\n\nBut t_1=8, so T=18,19,20\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (-40, -51, right, 4) \" only one car, same as freeway 1.\n\nSo similarly, 0 covered at δ=10,11,12, T=18,19,20\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars: (56, 45, right, 4) and (8, -3, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=56, tail=45, dir=right? tail=45, head=56, so since right, [τ, h] = [45,56] at t_1? But in notation, it says head h, tail τ, so for right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nThen at T, [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [45 + 4δ, 56 + 4δ]\n\n0 in span: 45+4δ ≤ 0 ≤ 56+4δ\n\nBut 45+4δ >0 for all δ≥0, since min at δ=0 is 45>0, so 0 never ≤ 45+4δ? 45+4δ ≤ 0 is impossible since 45+4δ ≥45>0, so 0 not <= lower bound? Let's see the inequality.\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nHere L=45+4δ, R=56+4δ, both >0, so L >0, so 0 < L <= R, so 0 not >= L, so 0 not in [L,R] for any δ. So first car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (8, -3, right, 4), so head=8, tail=-3, dir=right, so [τ, h] = [-3,8] at t_1\n\nAt T, [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-3 + 4δ, 8 + 4δ]\n\n0 in span: -3 +4δ <= 0 <= 8 +4δ\n\nFirst: -3 +4δ <=0 ⇒ 4δ <=3 ⇒ δ <= 0.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= 8+4δ always true for δ>=0\n\nSo δ <= 0.75, since δ integer >=0, δ=0\n\nδ=0: L= -3 +0 = -3, R=8+0=8, -3 <=0<=8, yes\n\nδ=1: L= -3+4=1, R=8+4=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false\n\nSo only at δ=0, which is T=t_1=8, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=t_1, we are at turn t_1, position y=2, which is freeway 2, not freeway 3. So for freeway 3, at δ=0, T=8, 0 is covered, but if player is on freeway 3 at that time, collision. But at T=8, player is on y=2, so for freeway 3, we only care if player is on it at some turn.\n\nNow similarly, other cars on freeway 3.\n\nFirst car doesn't cover, second covers only at δ=0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, 0 covered only at δ=0, T=8.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"4 | (56,45,right,4), (8,-3,right,4) \" same cars, so same as freeway 3: 0 covered only at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, \"5 | (56,45,right,4), (8,-3,right,4) \" so 0 covered only at δ=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: \"6 | (-24,11,left,36) \"\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, update: span at T is [h - sδ, τ - sδ]\n\nIn the rule: left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd at t_1, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] for left-moving? Let's see.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sδ, τ - sδ]\"\n\nHere head h=-24, tail τ=11? But for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and h should be the front, which for left is decreasing, so if moving left, head should be larger than tail? Inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sδ, τ - sδ]\"\n\nBut in this case, h=-24, τ=11, so [h, τ] = [-24,11], which is from left to right? But moving left, so the head is at -24, tail at 11? That doesn't make sense because if moving left, head should be on the right, decreasing.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are labeled based on direction.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6: (-24,11,left,36), and it says head h, tail τ.\n\nFor left-moving, the head is the leading part, so if moving left, head is at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nBut here h=-24, τ=11, so h=-24, τ=11, so τ=11 > h=-24, so if moving left, head should be at larger x, but -24 < 11, so x=-24 is left of x=11, so if moving left, from higher x to lower x, head should be at 11, tail at -24? I think there's confusion.\n\nLet's read the update rule carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\".\n\nIn the example, for freeway 6: head h=-24, tail τ=11, left direction.\n\nSince moving left, the head is the front, which is at the rightmost position, so x should be decreasing.\n\nBut here h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, so [h, τ] = [-24,11], which is increasing, but for left-moving, the span should be from high to low, but in interval notation, it's usually min to max.\n\nThe collision condition is about the span containing 0, so the interval [min, max] is what matters, not the order.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(T) = [h - sδ, τ - sδ], but since h and τ, with h < τ or what?\n\nIn this case, h=-24, τ=11, so min is h, max is τ, so [min, max] = [-24,11] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [h - sδ, τ - sδ] = [-24 - 36δ, 11 - 36δ]\n\nNow, 0 in this span if -24 -36δ <= 0 <= 11 -36δ\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36δ <= 0 ⇒ -36δ <= 24 ⇒ δ >= -24/36 = -2/3, always true for δ>=0\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36δ ⇒ 36δ <= 11 ⇒ δ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for integer δ>=0, only δ=0 possible.\n\nδ=0: L= -24, R=11, -24 <=0<=11, yes\n\nδ=1: L= -24-36= -60, R=11-36= -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in this, since 0 > -25? -25 <=0? -25 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -25? false, so 0 not <= upper bound.\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L <= 0 and 0 <= R.\n\nHere for δ=1, L=-60, R=-25, L<=0 true, but 0 <= R? 0 <= -25 false, so no.\n\nSimilarly for δ>1, R more negative, so only δ=0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, 0 covered only at δ=0, T=8.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4), as before, [45+4δ,56+4δ], min 45>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4), head=20, tail=9, so [τ, h] = [9,20] at t_1, then at T [9+4δ,20+4δ]\n\n0 in span: 9+4δ <=0 <=20+4δ? 9+4δ <=0? 4δ <= -9, impossible for δ>=0, so never.\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, so [τ, h] = [-27,-16] at t_1, then at T [-27+4δ, -16+4δ]\n\n0 in span: -27+4δ <=0 <= -16+4δ\n\nFirst: -27+4δ <=0 ⇒ 4δ <=27 ⇒ δ <= 6.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16+4δ ⇒ 4δ >=16 ⇒ δ >=4\n\nSo δ from 4 to 6.75, integer δ=4,5,6\n\nδ=4: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0], -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nδ=5: [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4], -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nδ=6: [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8], -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nδ=7: [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 1<=0? false\n\nSo for freeway 7, 0 covered at δ=4,5,6 → T= t_1 +4=12, t_1+5=13, t_1+6=14\n\nNow freeway 8: \"8 | (-40,-51,right,4) \" same as freeway 1, so 0 covered at δ=10,11,12 → T=18,19,20\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when 0 is covered (unsafe):\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=18,19,20 (δ=10,11,12)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=18,19,20 (same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=8 (δ=0)\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=18,19,20\n\nAt T=8, which is current turn, player is at y=2. At T=8, y=2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe at T=18,19,20, but at T=8, freeway 2 is safe? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 2, we have unsafe at T=18,19,20, but at T=8, is it safe?\n\nFrom above, for y=2, cars: only one car similar to y=1, which we said unsafe at δ=10,11,12, so at δ=0, which is T=8, for freeway 2, span is [-51,-40]? At t_1=8, for freeway 2, car span [τ, h] = [-51,-40], so [ -51, -40], which is from x=-51 to x=-40, so 0 is not in this interval since 0 > -40? -40 <= 0? -40 <=0 true, but 0 <= -40? false, so 0 not <= upper bound.\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L<=0 and 0<=R.\n\nL=-51, R=-40, L<=0 true, but 0<=R? 0<= -40 false, so 0 not in [-51,-40]. So at T=8, freeway 2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=8:\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=8? For y=3, at δ=0, second car span [-3,8], which includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nBut player is not on y=3 at T=8, so no problem.\n\nNow, player starts at T=8, y=2, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once we reach, it's fine.\n\nThe path is from y=2 to y=9, moving through y=3 to y=8, but avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and we can move U, D, S.\n\nMinimal moves to go from 2 to 9 is 7 steps of U, but we may need to wait or detour.\n\nBut moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nFirst, let's list for each y, the times it is unsafe.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=18,19,20\n\ny=2: unsafe T=18,19,20\n\ny=3: unsafe only T=8\n\nBut T=8 is now, so for future turns, y=3 is safe except at T=8 which has passed? At T=8, it is unsafe, but we are not on it, so for t>8, y=3 is always safe? At T=8, unsafe, but for T>8, from above, only unsafe at T=8, so for T=9,10,... it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: unsafe only T=8, so for T>8 safe.\n\ny=5: same, unsafe only T=8, so T>8 safe.\n\ny=6: unsafe only T=8, so T>8 safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=18,19,20\n\ny=9: always safe.\n\nWe start at T=8, y=2 (safe).\n\nWe need to be at some turn at y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up directly, but we need to check for each step if we can be on that y at that turn without collision.\n\nSince we start at T=8, y=2.\n\nAt turn T=8, we choose action a_{t_1} = a_8.\n\nThen y_{9} = y_8 + Δy, depending on action.\n\nThen at T=9, position y_9, and we check collision on freeway y_9 at turn T=9.\n\nSimilarly for next turns.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal H: H is the number of turns, so from start to end, after H turns, we are at y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, we take action, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have position y_T, and we need no collision at T for y_T.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, we take action a_T, then move to y_{T+1}, and at turn T, we check collision based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe last turn: when we reach y_{t_1 + H} =9, and since y=9 has no cars, it's always safe, and we don't need to take action after that, I think.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, leading to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, we start with position (0,y_{t_1}), take action a_{t_1}, then go to position (0,y_{t_1+1}) at turn t_1+1.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, position is (0,y_{t_1+1}), take action, and so on, until at some turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have a position y_T, and we need to ensure that at that turn T, on freeway y_T, no collision, meaning 0 not covered by cars on y_T at T.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe, no action taken or no need to check? The collision is only when on freeway y=1 to 8, so at y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe start at T=8, y=2, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up each turn.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\ny=3,4,5,6 are only unsafe at T=8, which is past, so for T>8, they are always safe.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8 is unsafe at T=18,19,20\n\nBut T=18,19,20 are later, and we might reach before that.\n\nSince we start at T=8, y=2.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nAt T=8, y=2, safe. Take a_8 = U, then y_9 = 3 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, position y=3, freeway 3. Now, y=3 is safe for T>8, so at T=9, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, take U, y_{10} =4 at T=10.\n\ny=4 safe at T=10.\n\nT=10, take U, y_{11}=5 at T=11.\n\nSafe.\n\nT=11, take U, y_{12}=6 at T=12.\n\nNow T=12, y=6, freeway 6. y=6 is only unsafe at T=8, so at T=12, safe.\n\nThen T=12, take U, y_{13}=7 at T=13.\n\nT=13, position y=7, freeway 7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=13, which is unsafe, so if we are on y=7 at T=13, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, at T=12, we are at y=6, if we take U, go to y=7 at T=13, which is unsafe.\n\nWe could stay or move down to avoid.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=6 (if we went up directly).\n\nThen instead of going up to y=7 at T=13, we could stay at y=6 or go down, but going down delays.\n\ny=6 is safe at all times except T=8, so at T=12 and later, safe.\n\nBut if we stay at T=12, action S, then y_{13} = y_{12} =6, so at T=13, position y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut we are still at y=6, not closer to 9.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=12,13,14, so we need to avoid being on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at T=18,19,20, but that might be later.\n\nFirst, let's handle y=7.\n\nUnsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at T=12,13, or 14.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, unsafe at T=18,19,20.\n\nNow, since we start at T=8, y=2.\n\nIf we go up directly:\n\nT=8: y=2, safe, take U\n\nT=9: y=3, safe, take U\n\nT=10: y=4, safe, take U\n\nT=11: y=5, safe, take U\n\nT=12: y=6, safe. Now at T=12, we are at y=6.\n\nIf we take U, we go to y=7 at T=13, but T=13 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf we take S, stay at y=6, then at T=13, position y=6, safe, but not progress.\n\nIf we take D, go to y=5 at T=13, which is safe, but worse.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 during T=12-14, we need to either be not on y=7 at those turns, or if we are, it must be safe, but it's not.\n\nSo we must skip y=7 during those turns.\n\nThat means we should reach y=7 before T=12 or after T=14.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, but T=18-20 is later, we might reach before.\n\nNow, T=12 is turn 12, t_1=8, so T=12 is 4 turns from now.\n\nFrom start, after 4 actions: at T=12, position y_{12}.\n\nStart at T=8, y=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=8, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action: T=9, y=?\n\nAfter k actions, at turn T=8+k, position y_{8+k}\n\nWe want y_{8+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each k from 0 to H-1, at turn T=8+k, position y_{8+k} must be safe.\n\nNow, at T=12, which is 8+4, so k=4, turn T=12.\n\nIf we go up directly, at T=12, y=6, as above.\n\nThen we need to be at y=7 at some turn not in {12,13,14}.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 not in {18,19,20}, but that may be ok.\n\nFirst, let's see the earliest we can reach y=9.\n\nIf no obstacles, min H=7, to go from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\nBut with y=7 unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nT=12 is turn 12.\n\nIf we go up faster? We start at y=2, T=8.\n\nAfter one up: T=9, y=3\n\nAfter two: T=10, y=4\n\nAfter three: T=11, y=5\n\nAfter four: T=12, y=6\n\nAfter five: T=13, y=7 but y=7 unsafe at T=13\n\nAfter six: T=14, y=8 if we go up, but T=14 y=7 to y=8, at T=14 position y=7? At turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt T=13, if we take U from y=6? Let's sequence.\n\nAt T=12: y=6, if take U, then y_{13}=7, so at turn T=13, position y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf at T=12, we take S, y_{13}=6, position at T=13 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=13, we can take U, y_{14}=7, position at T=14 y=7.\n\nBut T=14 is also unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we take U at T=13 to y=7 at T=14, unsafe.\n\nOr take S again, stay at y=6.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be at y=7 before T=12 or after T=14.\n\nBefore T=12: T=11 or earlier.\n\nCan we reach y=7 by T=11?\n\nStart T=8, y=2.\n\nT=8: take U, y_9=3\n\nT=9: take U, y_{10}=4\n\nT=10: take U, y_{11}=5\n\nT=11: take U, y_{12}=6\n\nAt T=11, position y=5.\n\nTo reach y=7 by T=11, that means at T=11, position y=7.\n\nBut from T=8 to T=11, we have 3 actions: at T=8,9,10.\n\nStart y=2 at T=8.\n\nAfter 3 actions: at T=11, y_{11}.\n\nIf we take U each time: y_9=3, y_{10}=4, y_{11}=5, so y=5 at T=11.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=11, we need to have moved up faster, but we can only move +1 per turn, so from y=2 to y=7 in 3 turns? 2 to 3,4,5,6,7? 5 steps? From T=8 to T=11, we take actions at T=8,9,10, so three actions, can increase y by at most 3, so y from 2 to 5 max, cannot reach y=7 by T=11.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=7: start y=2 T=8, after 5 actions: T=13 y=7 if all U.\n\nBut T=13 is unsafe.\n\nAfter 4 actions: T=12 y=6 or less.\n\ny=7 at T=12 would require at T=12 position y=7, which needs from T=8 to T=12, 4 actions, max y=2+4=6, so y=6 at T=12, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T, it takes at least 5 actions from start: since from y=2 to y=7, delta 5, so min 5 actions.\n\nAfter 5 actions: at turn T=8+5=13, position y_{13} = y_8 + sum of 5 Δy, each <=1, so y<=7, and if all U, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at earlier turn: at T=12, position y=12? Turn T=12, after actions at T=8,9,10,11, so 4 actions, y <= 2+4=6, so impossible to be at y=7 before T=13.\n\nSimilarly, after T=14: at T=15 or later.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at T=12,13,14 because:\n\n- Cannot be at y=7 before T=13 min\n\n- At T=13: possible, but unsafe\n\n- At T=14: possible, unsafe\n\n- After T=14: T=15 or later, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, but let's first handle y=7.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at T=15 or later.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=6 or other.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's see the timeline.\n\nStart T=8, y=2.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\ny=6 is safe at all times except T=8, so after T=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5,4,3 safe after T=8.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=6 if we went up.\n\nThen we need to stay or move until we can go to y=7 after T=14.\n\nSo at T=12: y=6, safe.\n\nWe need to not go to y=7 until after T=14.\n\nSo at T=12, we can take S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen T=13: position y=6, safe (since y=6 safe for T>8).\n\nThen at T=13, take S again, y_{14}=6, position at T=14 y=6.\n\nThen at T=14, take U, y_{15}=7, position at T=15 y=7.\n\nNow T=15, y=7: is it safe? y=7 unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so at T=15, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can proceed.\n\nBut we wasted two turns staying at y=6.\n\nFrom T=12 to T=14, we stay, then at T=15 go to y=7.\n\nThen we need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\ny=8 has unsafe at T=18,19,20.\n\nT=15 is before that, so we can go to y=8 quickly.\n\nAt T=15: y=7, take U, y_{16}=8, position at T=16 y=8.\n\nT=16, y=8: is it safe? y=8 unsafe at T=18,19,20, so at T=16, should be safe.\n\nThen T=16, take U, y_{17}=9, position at T=17 y=9, done.\n\nNow, check the turns.\n\nStart: T=8, y=2\n\nAction at T=8: U, to y=3 at T=9\n\nT=9: position y=3, take U, to y=4 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=4, take U, to y=5 at T=11\n\nT=11: y=5, take U, to y=6 at T=12\n\nT=12: y=6, take S (stay), to y=6 at T=13\n\nT=13: y=6, take S, to y=6 at T=14\n\nT=14: y=6, take U, to y=7 at T=15\n\nT=15: y=7, take U, to y=8 at T=16\n\nT=16: y=8, take U, to y=9 at T=17\n\nAt T=17, position y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\nT=8: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at T=18,19,20, so safe.\n\nT=9: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only at T=8, so for T=9>8, safe.\n\nT=10: y=4, similar, safe.\n\nT=11: y=5, safe.\n\nT=12: y=6, safe (only unsafe at T=8)\n\nT=13: y=6, safe\n\nT=14: y=6, safe\n\nT=15: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=12,13,14, T=15>14, so safe.\n\nT=16: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=18,19,20, T=16<18, so safe.\n\nT=17: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH = number of turns from start to end. Start at T=8, end at T=17, so number of actions: from T=8 to T=16, actions at T=8 to T=16, that's 9 actions? Turns: actions at turn T for T=8 to T=16, that's 9 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=8, so actions at turn 8,9,10,..., up to turn 8 + H -1.\n\nThen position at turn 8 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn 8+H to be 9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 17, y=9, so 8 + H = 17, so H=9.\n\nActions: at turn 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: that's 9 actions.\n\nList: t=0: turn 8, a_{t_1} = a_8\n\nt=1: turn 9, a_9\n\n...\n\nt=8: turn 16, a_{16}? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=9, t=0 to 8, turns 8 to 16.\n\nPosition at turn 17.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions from T=8 to T=16, and position at T=17 is 9.\n\nNow, but we stayed at y=6 for three turns: at T=12,13,14 we were at y=6, but actions: at T=12: S, T=13: S, T=14: U to y=7 at T=15.\n\nIn terms of position at turn: T=12: y=6, T=13: y=6, T=14: y=6, T=15: y=7, etc.\n\nBut we wasted two turns staying.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 earlier or later, but earlier not possible.\n\nAfter T=14, we can go.\n\nBut at T=11, we are at y=5 if we go up directly.\n\nAt T=11: y=5, safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at T=12, we could stay at y=5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps go to a different y.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is unsafe from T=12 to 14, we could be on y=7 before, but impossible, or after.\n\nBut after T=14, we go at T=15.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at T=17.\n\nMinimal without obstacles is T=15: from T=8 y=2, after 7 actions: T=15 y=9? Actions at T=8 to T=14, 7 actions, position at T=15.\n\nWith all U: T=8 to T=14 actions: y from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9? After first U at T=8, y9=3; T=9 U, y10=4; ... T=13 U, y14=8? Let's see:\n\nStart T=8 y=2\n\nAfter a8=U, T=9 y=3\n\na9=U, T=10 y=4\n\na10=U, T=11 y=5\n\na11=U, T=12 y=6\n\na12=U, T=13 y=7\n\na13=U, T=14 y=8\n\na14=U, T=15 y=9\n\nSo position at T=15 y=9.\n\nBut at T=13, position y=7, which is during unsafe period T=13, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14, position y=8, but y=8 is safe at T=14, since unsafe only at T=18-20.\n\nBut the problem is at T=13 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot have that.\n\nTo avoid, we need to delay being on y=7.\n\nIn the first plan, we stayed at y=6 from T=12 to T=14, then moved.\n\nBut at T=14, we are at y=6, take U to y=7 at T=15.\n\nIn that case, we reached at T=17.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier if we don't stay as long.\n\nSince we need to be on y=7 after T=14, earliest T=15.\n\nThen from y=7 at T=15, we can go to y=8 at T=16, y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=15, we need to have moved from y=2 to y=7 in some turns.\n\nFrom T=8 to T=15, there are 7 turns: T=8 to T=14 actions? Positions.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T=15, that means after actions up to T=14.\n\ny_{15} is set after action at T=14.\n\nIf we want position at T=15 to be y=7, that means at T=14, we were at some y, took action to go to y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe time to go from y=2 to y=7 is min 5 steps, so earliest at T=13 y=7, but unsafe.\n\nNext possible T=14 y=7: but to be at y=7 at T=14, need at T=13 position y=6 or 7 or 8, but if at y=6, take U to y=7; or at y=7 take S; or at y=8 take D, but that's worse.\n\nBut at T=14, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=7 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15: if at T=14, position y=6, take U to y=7 at T=15; or y=7 take S to y=7; but y=7 at T=15 is safe.\n\nBut to have y=7 at T=15, we can have from y=6 at T=14, take U.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 at T=15 by other ways.\n\nBut the point is, we cannot be at y=7 at T=13 or 14.\n\nAt T=15 is ok.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=7 at T=15, take U to y=8 at T=16, then U to y=9 at T=17.\n\nSo minimal seems to be at T=17.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=14, if we are at y=8, but to be at y=8 at T=14, from y=2, min 6 steps: T=8 to T=13 actions, position at T=14 y=8.\n\nBut at T=13, position would be y=7 or something.\n\nStart: T=8 y=2\n\na8=U, T=9 y=3\n\n...\n\na12=U, T=13 y=7? Actions: a8 to a12: 5 actions? T=8 to T=12 actions: a8,a9,a10,a11,a12: 5 actions.\n\nAfter a8: T=9 y=3\n\nAfter a9: T=10 y=4\n\nAfter a10: T=11 y=5\n\nAfter a11: T=12 y=6\n\nAfter a12: T=13 y=7  (if a12=U)\n\nPosition at T=13 y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=14: need at T=13 position y=7 or 8, and take action to y=8.\n\nIf at T=13 y=7, take U to y=8 at T=14.\n\nBut at T=13 y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at T=13, but from y=2 to y=8 in 5 actions? Min 6 actions to increase by 6, from y=2 to y=8, delta 6, min 6 actions.\n\nAfter 6 actions: at turn T=8+6=14, position y_{14}.\n\nWith all U, y=2+6=8.\n\nBut at T=14, position y=8.\n\ny=8 is unsafe only at T=18-20, so at T=14 safe.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at T=14, we must have been on y=7 at some point.\n\nSpecifically, at T=13, position must be y=7, to take U to y=8 at T=14.\n\nBut at T=13, y=7 is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=8 at T=14 because it requires being on y=7 at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T=15: possible if at T=14 position y=7, take U to y=8 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15 y=8, safe since T=15<18.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nIn any case, to avoid y=7 during T=12-14, we must not be on y=7 at T=13 or T=14, so the earliest we can be on y=7 is T=15.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at T=17.\n\nIn the first plan, we have H=9, reaching at T=17.\n\nBut can we reach earlier than T=17?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 earlier and wait less, but we are at y=6 at T=12, which is the earliest possible, since from T=8 to T=12, 4 actions, y=6.\n\nThen we need to wait until T=14 to take action to go to y=7 at T=15? At T=14, we take action to set y_{15}.\n\nIf at T=14 we take U from y=6, y_{15}=7.\n\nBut we have to be at T=14 position y=6, which we are from T=12 to T=14 if we stay.\n\nWe could have been at other positions, but y=6 is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 has unsafe later, but we might reach before T=18.\n\nIn this case, with the waiting, we reach y=9 at T=17, before T=18.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can save a turn.\n\nSuppose at T=11, we are at y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at T=12, we go down or stay, but that would make us slower.\n\nFor example, at T=11 y=5, take D to y=4 at T=12, but then we are lower, worse.\n\nNot useful.\n\nPerhaps we can spend time on other freeways, but all lower freeways are safe, so staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nBut we need to reach y=7 at T=15.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=7 in 7 steps? But with waiting.\n\nThe minimal H: since we must take at least 7 actions to increase y by 7, but we start at y=2, end at y=9, delta y=7, so min 7 actions if all U.\n\nBut due to obstacle, we need extra actions to wait.\n\nIn this case, we added 2 extra actions: two S at T=12 and T=13.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions: U,U,U,U (to go to y=6 by T=12), then S,S,U (to go to y=7 at T=15), then U,U to y=9 at T=17.\n\nActions: 4U + 2S + 3U? From T=8 to T=16: actions: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U\n\nThat's 9 actions: 6U and 2S, one less U? a8 to a16 is 9 actions.\n\nList:\n\n- a8: U\n\n- a9: U\n\n- a10: U\n\n- a11: U  // now at T=12 y=6\n\n- a12: S  // stay y=6\n\n- a13: S  // stay y=6\n\n- a14: U  // to y=7 at T=15\n\n- a15: U  // to y=8 at T=16\n\n- a16: U  // to y=9 at T=17\n\na16 is the last action at turn 16, position at turn 17 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 9.\n\nBut we have 6 U and 2 S, and one more? a8 to a16: 9 actions, but y from 2 to 9, net +7, but we have two S, so effective moves: 7U and 2S, with 2S not changing y, so y increases by 7 in 9 turns.\n\nMinimal possible: since we must avoid being on y=7 at T=13 and T=14, and we must be on y=7 at some point, the earliest safe is T=15.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=15, we need to have taken 5 up moves to increase from 2 to 7, but in the timeline.\n\nFrom start T=8 y=2 to T=15 y=7, we have 7 turns: T=9 to T=15 positions.\n\nAt T=15 y=7, which requires that at T=14, we were at y=6 and took U, or at y=7 and took S, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should be at y=6 as early as possible and wait until T=14 to take U.\n\nEarliest at y=6 is T=12, as before.\n\nThen at T=12,13,14 we are at y=6, but at T=14 we take U to go to y=7 at T=15.\n\nBut at T=14, position is y=6, we take action to set y_{15}.\n\nSo we are at y=6 for turns T=12,13,14.\n\nThen T=15 y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=16, y=9 at T=17.\n\nNo way to save a turn, because if we could be at y=7 at T=15 with fewer actions, but min actions to y=7 is 5, at T=13, but unsafe.\n\nT=15 is later.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: what about y=8 unsafe at T=18-20, but since we reach before, no issue.\n\nIn this plan, we reach y=9 at T=17, before T=18.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at T=16.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=16, position at turn 16 y=9.\n\nThat means after action at T=15, we set y_{16}=9.\n\nSo at T=15, we must be at y=8 and take U.\n\nSo need position at T=15 y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=15.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at T=15.\n\nThis requires at T=14, position y=7 or 8, and take action to y=8.\n\nIf at T=14 y=7, take U to y=8 at T=15.\n\nBut at T=14, position y=7 is unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf at T=14 y=8, take S to y=8 at T=15.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=14, which requires at T=13 position y=7 or 8, take action to y=8.\n\nBut at T=13, if position y=7, take U to y=8 at T=14, but at T=13 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf position at T=13 y=8, but to be at y=8 at T=13, from y=2 at T=8, min 6 actions to T=13, y=8, but at T=13 position y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=18-20, so T=13 safe.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at T=13?\n\nStart y=2 T=8.\n\nAfter 5 actions: at turn T=13, position y_{13}.\n\nWith all U: after a8 U, T=9 y=3; ... after a12 U, T=13 y=7? Actions: a8 to a12: 5 actions, position at T=13 y=7 if all U.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=13, need 6 up moves, but from T=8 to T=13, we have actions at T=8,9,10,11,12: 5 actions, can increase y by at most 5, from 2 to 7, cannot reach y=8 at T=13.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is T=14 with 6 actions.\n\nAt T=14, position y=8, safe, as earlier.\n\nBut to reach that, we need to be at y=7 at T=13 to take U, but T=13 y=7 unsafe.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=8 at T=14 or y=9 at T=16 because it requires being on y=7 at an unsafe time.\n\nThus, the minimal is to reach at T=17 as in the first plan.\n\nBut in that plan, we have two stay actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one stay or something, but I think not.\n\nAnother idea: we could move down to y=1 or something to wait, but y=1 is unsafe at later times, but we can avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=12, instead of staying at y=6, we go down to y=5 or something, but that might not help and could be worse.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at T=18-20, but we are not there at that time, no issue.\n\nIn our current plan, we don't go to y=1 or 2.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7.\n\nEarlier for y=7, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nT=12,13,14 relative to t_1=8, so T=20,21,22? No.\n\nt_1=8, δ=T-t_1.\n\nFor y=7, unsafe at δ=4,5,6 which is T=8+4=12, 8+5=13, 8+6=14, yes.\n\nAnd we avoid being on y=7 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have:\n\nTurn t_1 =8: action U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd position at turn 17: y=9.\n\nBut turn 16 action U to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=9, so turns 8 to 16.\n\nActions: a8 to a16.\n\nIn the sequence above, a14 is U to y=7? Let's list the actions and positions clearly.\n\nTurn | position at start | action | new position\n\nTurn 8: pos (0,2), take a8=U, then position at turn 9: (0,3)\n\nTurn 9: pos (0,3), take a9=U, position turn 10: (0,4)\n\nTurn 10: pos (0,4), take a10=U, position turn 11: (0,5)\n\nTurn 11: pos (0,5), take a11=U, position turn 12: (0,6)\n\nTurn 12: pos (0,6), take a12=S, position turn 13: (0,6)\n\nTurn 13: pos (0,6), take a13=S, position turn 14: (0,6)\n\nTurn 14: pos (0,6), take a14=U, position turn 15: (0,7)\n\nTurn 15: pos (0,7), take a15=U, position turn 16: (0,8)\n\nTurn 16: pos (0,8), take a16=U, position turn 17: (0,9)\n\nAt turn 17, position (0,9), reached.\n\nAll positions during turns 8 to 16 are safe, as checked.\n\nNow, the actions are from turn 8 to 16, that is t from 0 to 8, H=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 8: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 16: a_{t_1 + 8}\n\nt_1=8, so turns 8 to 16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce H.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at T=15, but then to y=8 at T=16, y=9 at T=17.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 at T=15, but as before, requires y=7 at T=14 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can skip y=7 or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the player can move down to y=1 or 0, but y=0 is safe, and y=1 is unsafe only at T=18-20, but if we go down, it takes more time to go up, so not helpful.\n\nFor example, at T=11, y=5, instead of U, go D to y=4 at T=12, then we are lower, then need more steps to go up, worse.\n\nSo not beneficial.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have two S actions, which are necessary to wait.\n\nPerhaps we can have one S if we time differently, but I think not.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=6 later, but we can't, since we reach at T=12 earliest.\n\nIf we stay at y=5 for one turn, but that would make us reach later.\n\nFor instance: suppose at T=11, y=5, take S, then at T=12 position y=5, then take U to y=6 at T=13, then at T=13 position y=6, take U to y=7 at T=14, but T=14 y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nThen we need to stay or something.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first plan is optimal.\n\nTherefore, H=9, actions as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 14 action U, from y=6 to y=7 at turn 15.\n\nThen turn 15 U to y=8 at turn 16.\n\nTurn 16 U to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 7, we have cars, but we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nAlso, for y=8, unsafe at T=18-20, but we are at y=8 at T=16, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 2 at T=8, we are safe, as we checked.\n\nSo, the minimal number is H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns relative to t_1.\n\nt_1=8, actions from t=0 to 8: turns 8 to 16.\n\nPosition at turn 17.\n\nH=9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the optimal sequence requires 9 turns (\\(H = 9\\)). The sequence of actions avoids the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 18, 19, 20\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 8\\) (which has passed).\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 18, 19, 20\\).\n\nThe player starts at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe. Moving up directly would place the player on \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(T = 13\\) or \\(T = 14\\), which is unsafe. To avoid this, the player stays on \\(y = 6\\) (which is safe for \\(T > 8\\)) during turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\) by using \"S\" actions. Then, the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 15\\) (safe), \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 16\\) (safe), and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 17\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 8, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, action \"S\" stays at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 13.\n- At turn 13, action \"S\" stays at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 14.\n- At turn 14, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the vertical direction. The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the horizontal position of the player). Note: the player's horizontal position is always 0.\n\nImportant: When moving from freeway y at turn T to freeway y' at turn T+1, at turn T the player is only on freeway y and at turn T+1 only on freeway y'. Therefore, we only check the freeway we are currently on at that turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 10). The cars are moving at constant speed. For a car at freeway k:\n\n- If direction is 'right', then the car moves to the right. The span at time T (>= t1) is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since initially at t1: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]). But note: the example input has head and tail, and for right-moving the head is the front (so at t1, the car covers [tau, h] and then moves right so the entire segment shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\n- If direction is 'left', then the car moves to the left. The span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (since at t1 the car is from h to tau, and then moves left by s*(T-t1)).\n\nHowever, note the representation in the input:\n\nFor freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36). This is a left-moving car. At t1=10, the car spans from 48 to 83? But that would be a positive length? Actually, for a left-moving car, the head is the front which is at the larger coordinate? But when moving left, the head (front) is at 48 and tail at 83? That seems backwards. Let me read the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36). So h=48, tau=83? Then the initial span is [48, 83]. But that would be a car of length 35? And moving left, so at time T, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-10), 83 - 36*(T-10)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, freeway) and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the times T (>=10) at which the car's span covers 0.\n\nHowever, the problem is to find a sequence of actions that avoids collisions and gets to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe start at y=4 at turn 10.\n\nWe need to plan a path from y=4 to y=9. The minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 5 (by going up 5 times). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must check for each turn and each freeway we are on whether at that turn the freeway we are on has a car that covers 0.\n\nLet's compute the time intervals (if any) during which a car covers 0 for each freeway.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving at constant speed. For a car, we can compute the time interval when 0 is in its span.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  Let the initial head = h, tail = tau (at t1=10). Then at time T, the head is at h + s*(T-10) and the tail at tau + s*(T-10).\n  The span is [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)] (since tau <= h? Actually, in the input for right-moving cars, we see negative numbers and positive. But note: the representation: for example, freeway 1: (-32, -43, right, 4). Here, h=-32, tau=-43. Then the span at T is [ -43 + 4*(T-10), -32 + 4*(T-10) ].\n\n  We require 0 to be in [ -43 + 4*(T-10), -32 + 4*(T-10) ].\n\n  So: \n      -43 + 4*(T-10) <= 0 <= -32 + 4*(T-10)\n\n  Solve:\n      -43 + 4T - 40 <= 0  => 4T <= 83 => T <= 20.75\n      and \n      0 <= -32 + 4T - 40 => 4T >= 72 => T>=18\n\n  So for freeway 1, the car covers 0 from T=18 to T=20 (inclusive? since T are integers?).\n\n  But note: T must be integer? The turns are discrete. So T=18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same car: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> same as freeway 1: T=18,19,20.\n\nFor freeway 3: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n  Span at T: [-59+4*(T-10), -48+4*(T-10)]\n  Condition: -59+4T-40 <= 0 <= -48+4T-40\n      => 4T <= 99 -> T<=24.75\n      and 4T>=88 -> T>=22\n  So T=22,23,24.\n\nCar2: (16, 5, right, 4) -> wait, head=16, tail=5? But then the span at T is [5+4*(T-10), 16+4*(T-10)].\n  Condition: 5+4*(T-10) <= 0 <= 16+4*(T-10)\n  => 5+4T-40 <=0 => 4T<=35 => T<=8.75 -> but T>=10, so no solution? \n  Actually, at T=10: [5+0, 16+0] = [5,16] -> doesn't cover 0. And as T increases, the car moves to the right so it will never cover 0. So this car is safe.\n\nThus freeway 3 is dangerous only at T=22,23,24 (from the first car).\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as above: T=22,23,24.\n  Car2: (16,5,right,4) -> same as above: safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4: T=22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n  For left-moving: span at T: [48 - 36*(T-10), 83 - 36*(T-10)]\n  Condition: 48 - 36*(T-10) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-10)\n\n  First part: 48 -36T + 360 <=0 -> -36T <= -408 -> T>=408/36 = 11.333 -> so T>=12 (since integer) \n  Second part: 0<=83-36*(T-10) -> 36*(T-10)<=83 -> T-10 <= 83/36 ~ 2.305 -> T<=12.305 -> so T<=12.\n\n  Therefore, T must be in [12,12] -> only T=12.\n\n  So freeway 6 is dangerous at T=12.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as before: T=22,23,24.\n  Car2: (28,17,right,4) -> head=28, tail=17? Then the span at T is [17+4*(T-10), 28+4*(T-10)].\n        Condition: 17+4T-40<=0<=28+4T-40\n        => 4T<=23 -> T<=5.75 (so never for T>=10) -> safe.\n  Car3: (-8,-19,right,4) -> span: [-19+4*(T-10), -8+4*(T-10)]\n        Condition: -19+4T-40<=0<=-8+4T-40\n        => 4T<=59 -> T<=14.75\n        and 4T>=48 -> T>=12\n        So T=12,13,14.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 7 is dangerous at:\n        Car1: T=22,23,24\n        Car3: T=12,13,14\n\n  So overall, freeway 7 is dangerous at T=12,13,14,22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 8: (-32,-43,right,4) -> same as freeway 1: T=18,19,20.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: T=18,19,20\nFreeway 2: T=18,19,20\nFreeway 3: T=22,23,24\nFreeway 4: T=22,23,24\nFreeway 5: T=22,23,24\nFreeway 6: T=12\nFreeway 7: T=12,13,14,22,23,24\nFreeway 8: T=18,19,20\n\nWe start at turn 10 at y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 5 (if we go up 5 times). But we have to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nLet me denote the player's position at turn T (for T>=10) as y_T.\n\nWe must have:\n  For each T from 10 to the end, if the player is at freeway k (which is y_T) and k is between 1 and 8, then T must not be a dangerous turn for freeway k.\n\nWe start at T=10, y=4 (freeway 4? but note: freeways are y=1 to 8. The player is at y=4, so freeway 4? Actually, the freeway index is the y-coordinate. So at turn 10, we are on freeway 4.\n\nBut freeway 4 is dangerous at T=22,23,24. At T=10, we are safe? because 10 is not in {22,23,24}. So we are safe at T=10.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves from y=4 to y=9 without stepping on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe are allowed to move vertically by at most 1 per turn. We can also stay.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn T = 10 + (H-1) (since the first action at turn 10 moves us to turn 11 at a new y? Actually, note: the actions are taken at turn t, and then the position updates for the next turn.\n\nBut note: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t. Then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nTherefore, at the moment of turn t, we are at y_t. We are concerned with the car on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn 10: we are at (0,4). We choose a_10 -> then at turn 11, we are at y_11 = y_10 + Delta y_10.\n\nBut at turn 10, we are on freeway 4. And at turn 10, freeway 4 is safe (since 10 not in [22,23,24]).\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  - At turn 10: freeway 4 is safe.\n\n  - Then we move to turn 11: we are at y_11. We must check freeway y_11 at turn 11.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The direct way is to go up 5 times: \n  T=10: y=4 -> action U -> T=11: y=5 -> U -> T=12: y=6 -> U -> T=13: y=7 -> U -> T=14: y=8 -> U -> T=15: y=9.\n\nBut we must check for collisions:\n\n  T=10: y=4 -> safe (as above)\n  T=11: y=5 -> freeway 5: dangerous at T=22,23,24 -> safe at T=11.\n  T=12: y=6 -> freeway 6: dangerous at T=12 -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot go straight up at turn 12 because freeway 6 is dangerous at T=12.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 6 at turn 12.\n\nOptions:\n  - Avoid being on freeway 6 at turn 12 by either:\n        a) Delaying the move to freeway 6 until after turn 12.\n        b) Being on freeway 6 at a different turn? But note: freeway 6 only has one dangerous turn: 12. So if we are on freeway 6 at any turn other than 12, it is safe.\n\nBut we are currently at y=4 at T=10. We need to get to y=9. We can try to take a detour? Or wait.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to skip freeway 6 at turn 12 by not moving to y=6 at turn 12.\n\nFor example, at turn 11 (when we are at y=5) we could do something else.\n\nBut note: at turn 11, we are at y=5 (safe because freeway5 is only dangerous at 22,23,24). Then at turn 11, we can choose:\n\n  Option 1: Stay at y=5 (action S) at turn 11 -> then at turn 12 we are still at y=5 (so freeway5 at turn12: safe). Then at turn12 we can move up to y=6? But then at turn12 we are at y=5 (so safe) and then at turn13 we move to y=6? But we must check at turn13: freeway6 at turn13 is safe (since dangerous only at 12).\n\nSo let's try:\n\n  T=10: start at y=4 -> action U -> T=11: y=5 (freeway5 at T=11: safe)\n  T=11: action S -> T=12: y=5 (freeway5 at T=12: safe) \n  T=12: action U -> T=13: y=6 (freeway6 at T=13: safe because dangerous only at 12)\n  Then continue: T=13: U -> T=14: y=7 -> freeway7 at T=14: dangerous! (because freeway7 is dangerous at 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> T=14 is dangerous)\n\nSo at T=14 we are at y=7 -> collision.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at T=14 as well.\n\nWe can try to adjust:\n\n  We need to avoid being on freeway7 at T=14. How?\n\n  We can try to get to freeway7 earlier or later? \n\n  The dangerous turns for freeway7: 12,13,14,22,23,24.\n\n  So if we can avoid freeway7 at T=14, we might:\n\n        Option A: Be on freeway7 at a safe turn? The safe turns for freeway7 are all turns except 12,13,14,22,23,24. So for example, T=15 is safe.\n\n        Option B: Skip freeway7 entirely? But we have to go from 6 to 8, so we must pass through 7.\n\nSo we can try to delay the move to freeway7 until after T=14.\n\nBut note: we are at T=13: we are at y=6. Then at T=13 we want to go to y=7? That would put us at y=7 at T=14 -> which is dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, at T=13 we stay at y=6? Then at T=14 we are at y=6 (safe for freeway6 at T=14? freeway6 is only dangerous at 12 -> safe). Then at T=14 we move to y=7? Then we are at y=7 at T=15 -> which is safe for freeway7? because 15 is not in {12,13,14,22,23,24}.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\n  T=15: move to y=8 -> T=16: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=16: dangerous? freeway8 is dangerous at 18,19,20 -> safe at 16.\n  T=16: move to y=9 -> T=17: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut note: at T=17 we are at y=9 -> and the goal is reached? The problem says: we must reach (0,9). And the freeways that we worry about are y=1..8. So once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  T=10: at y=4 -> action U -> T=11: y=5\n  T=11: action S (stay) -> T=12: y=5\n  T=12: action U -> T=13: y=6\n  T=13: action S (stay) -> T=14: y=6\n  T=14: action U -> T=15: y=7\n  T=15: action U -> T=16: y=8\n  T=16: action U -> T=17: y=9\n\nTotal turns: from T=10 to T=17 -> that's 7 actions? But note: at T=10 we take the first action, then we have positions at T=11 to T=17. The goal is reached at T=17? The problem says: we want the sequence of actions from t1 (10) until the turn when we are at (0,9). And at T=17 we are at (0,9). So H=7? But note: the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at the end of these actions we are at (0,9). The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. So we require that at turn t1+H we are at y=9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\n  We take actions at turns: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16 -> 7 actions. Then at turn 17 we are at y=9. So H=7? But the minimal without obstacles is 5, and we are taking 7.\n\nBut let's verify the collisions:\n\n  T=10: y=4 -> safe (as above)\n  T=11: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 safe at T=11)\n  T=12: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 safe at T=12)\n  T=13: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=13: safe (only dangerous at T=12)\n  T=14: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=14: safe\n  T=15: y=7 -> freeway7 at T=15: safe (dangerous only at 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> 15 is safe)\n  T=16: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=16: safe (dangerous at 18,19,20 -> safe)\n  T=17: y=9 -> goal, no freeway check (since y=9 is not a freeway with cars)\n\nBut wait: at T=17 we don't check because we are at y=9 and the cars are on freeways 1-8.\n\nSo this plan seems safe.\n\nBut can we do better? For example, avoid the two stays? \n\nWe had to avoid freeway6 at T=12 and freeway7 at T=14. We did that by staying at T=11 (to avoid being at y=6 at T=12) and then staying at T=13 (to avoid being at y=7 at T=14). \n\nAlternatively, we might go down? But that would be moving away from the goal.\n\nAnother idea: at T=10, we could go down? But that would be moving away from 9, so probably not minimal.\n\nWe could try to move faster in the beginning? \n\nBut we are at T=10 at y=4. We want to get to y=9. We have to go up 5 times. The minimal steps is 5. But we have to avoid two dangerous times: T=12 at y=6 and T=14 at y=7.\n\nWe must not be at y=6 at T=12 and not at y=7 at T=14.\n\nWe can try to shift the entire path so that we are at y=6 at a turn other than 12 and y=7 at a turn other than 14.\n\nWe start at T=10 at y=4.\n\nIf we go up without delay:\n\n  T=10: y=4 -> U\n  T=11: y=5 -> U\n  T=12: y=6 -> collision (freeway6 at T=12)\n\nSo we must delay the arrival at y=6 until after T=12. The next chance is T=13. So we must be at y=6 at T=13 at the earliest.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid being at y=7 at T=14. So we must be at y=7 at T=15 at the earliest.\n\nThen:\n\n  We must have:\n      T=13: y=6\n      T=15: y=7\n\nBut then we can do:\n\n      T=10: y=4 -> U -> T=11: y=5\n      T=11: U -> T=12: y=6 -> but we cannot be at y=6 at T=12 -> so we must not do U at T=11.\n\nInstead, we can do:\n\n      T=10: U -> T=11: y=5\n      T=11: S -> T=12: y=5\n      T=12: U -> T=13: y=6  [good]\n      T=13: U -> T=14: y=7 -> but we cannot be at y=7 at T=14 -> so we must avoid.\n\nSo we do:\n\n      T=13: S -> T=14: y=6\n      T=14: U -> T=15: y=7  [good]\n      T=15: U -> T=16: y=8\n      T=16: U -> T=17: y=9\n\nThis is the same as above: 7 actions.\n\nBut can we avoid one of the stays? For example, can we be at y=7 at T=15 without having to stay at T=13? \n\nWe could try to go faster from T=13 to T=15? But we can only move one step at a time. So from T=13 (y=6) we can only get to y=7 at T=14. But T=14 is dangerous for y=7. So we have to wait until T=14 to move from y=6 to y=7, arriving at T=15.\n\nAlternatively, we might take a detour? For example, go down at some point? But that would cost more steps.\n\nFor instance, at T=10: go down to y=3? Then we have to cover 6 steps to get to 9 -> that would be at least 6 moves, and we still have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut let's see: if we go down to y=3 at T=11, then we can go:\n\n  T=10: D -> T=11: y=3\n  T=11: U -> T=12: y=4\n  T=12: U -> T=13: y=5\n  T=13: U -> T=14: y=6 -> but freeway6 is safe at T=14? yes (only dangerous at 12) -> safe\n  T=14: U -> T=15: y=7 -> but freeway7 at T=15: safe? yes (dangerous at 12,13,14 -> 15 is safe)\n  T=15: U -> T=16: y=8\n  T=16: U -> T=17: y=9\n\nBut that also takes 7 moves. And we went down then up, which is the same number.\n\nBut we started at y=4 and went down to 3, which is one extra move? Actually, the sequence:\n\n  T=10: D -> T=11: y=3 (1 move)\n  Then from 3 to 9: 6 moves -> total 7 moves.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we avoided the two stays? Actually, we replaced two stays with a down and then an up? But the down at T=10 and up at T=11: that's two moves to go from 4 to 3 to 4? But we went from 4 to 3 at T=11, then to 4 at T=12? So we are at 4 at T=12. Then we have to go up to 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 moves: total 7 moves.\n\nBut we still end at T=17.\n\nSo same total turns.\n\nBut note: we avoided the dangerous times: \n  T=12: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: dangerous at 22,23,24 -> safe at T=12.\n  T=14: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: safe at T=14.\n  T=15: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: safe at T=15.\n\nSo that also works.\n\nBut is it minimal? Both take 7 moves. The minimal without obstacles is 5, but we have two obstacles that force at least two delays? Because we have to avoid two specific (turn, freeway) pairs. Since we can only move one step per turn, we cannot jump over. So we have to wait until the dangerous turn passes. \n\nIn the first plan we waited at T=11 (so we lost one turn) and at T=13 (another lost turn) -> total 5+2=7.\n\nIn the second plan we did a down and then an up, which is effectively two moves that don't make progress (actually, we went down and then came back, so net zero progress) and then we did the 5 moves up -> 5+2=7.\n\nSo both are 7.\n\nBut note: we might be able to do it in 6? \n\nHow? We have to get from 4 to 9 in 6 moves? That would be 5 moves up and one extra move? But what extra move? We have to avoid two obstacles.\n\nWe must not be at y=6 at T=12 and not at y=7 at T=14.\n\nWe start at T=10 at y=4.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at T=16 (if we take 6 actions: at T=10,11,12,13,14,15 -> then at T=16 we are at y=9).\n\nWe must assign the positions for T=10 to T=16.\n\n  T=10: y=4 (fixed)\n  T=11: can be 3,4,5\n  T=12: can be 2,3,4,5,6 (but we must avoid y=6 at T=12)\n  T=13: ... and so on.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 at T=16.\n\nWe need a sequence of moves that goes from 4 to 9 in 6 moves? That is 5 net up moves. So we can have 5 up moves and one non-up move? The non-up move can be a down or a stay.\n\nBut if we do a down, then we have to make up for it with an extra up -> so we end up with 6 moves: 6 up and one down? That would be 5 net up moves? Actually, 6 up minus one down = 5 net up moves. So that would work. But then we have 6 up moves and one down? That would be 7 moves? \n\nWait: we have 6 moves (actions) from T=10 to T=15. Then at T=16 we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at T=10: y=4.\n\nWe take 6 actions: a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15.\n\nThe net displacement must be +5 (from 4 to 9).\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo if we let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S, then:\n   u - d = 5\n   u + d + s = 6\n\nThen: \n   u = 5 + d\n   => 5+d + d + s = 6 -> 5 + 2d + s = 6 -> 2d+s=1.\n\nSo either d=0 and s=1 -> then u=5 -> but then we have one stay and five ups: total 6 moves? But then we are at 4 + 5 = 9? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, d=1 and s=-1? not possible. Or d=0.5? not integer.\n\nSo the only possibility is: 5 ups and 1 stay.\n\nSo we must have one stay and five ups in 6 moves.\n\nNow we must assign the moves so that:\n\n  We avoid being at y=6 at T=12 and at y=7 at T=14.\n\nLet the moves be:\n\n  T=10: a10\n  T=11: a11\n  T=12: a12\n  T=13: a13\n  T=14: a14\n  T=15: a15\n\nAnd the positions:\n\n  T=10: y=4\n  T=11: y=4 + a10 (where a10: U->+1, D->-1, S->0)\n  T=12: y_{11} + a11\n  T=13: y_{12} + a12\n  T=14: y_{13} + a13\n  T=15: y_{14} + a14\n  T=16: y_{15} + a15 = 9\n\nWe require:\n\n  At T=12: we are at y_{12} and must not be 6? -> so y_{12} != 6.\n  At T=14: we are at y_{14} and must not be 7? -> so y_{14} != 7.\n\nAnd we have exactly one stay and five ups.\n\nWe start at 4 and end at 9: so we must go up 5 times and stay once.\n\nWe need to assign the stay at one of the moves.\n\nLet me denote the position at each T:\n\n  T=10: 4\n  T=11: 4 + d10\n  T=12: 4 + d10 + d11\n  T=13: 4 + d10 + d11 + d12\n  T=14: 4 + d10 + d11 + d12 + d13\n  T=15: 4 + d10 + d11 + d12 + d13 + d14\n  T=16: 4 + d10 + d11 + d12 + d13 + d14 + d15 = 9\n\nSo the sum of the deltas (d10 to d15) is 5.\n\nAnd each delta is in {-1,0,1} but we know that we have five +1 and one 0.\n\nSo the cumulative sum at T=12 (after 2 moves) is: d10+d11 = y12 - 4.\n\nWe require y12 != 6 -> so d10+d11 != 2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14 (after 4 moves): d10+d11+d12+d13 = y14-4, and we require y14 !=7 -> so d10+d11+d12+d13 != 3.\n\nWe have:\n\n  d10, d11, d12, d13, d14, d15: five 1's and one 0.\n\nWe must assign the 0 to one of the six positions.\n\nCase 1: the stay is at T=10: then d10=0.\n  Then:\n      T=11: y=4\n      T=12: 4 + d11 -> if d11=1, then y12=5; if d11=0? but we have only one stay -> but then we have five ups to assign to the remaining five moves -> so d11 must be 1 -> then y12=5 (safe, not 6)\n      Then T=13: 5 + d12 -> if d12=1 -> 6; if d12=0 -> 5; but we have only one stay -> so d12 must be 1? then y13=6.\n      T=14: 6 + d13 -> if d13=1 -> 7 (dangerous at T=14? we are at T=14 at y=7 -> collision) -> so we must have d13=0? but we already used the stay -> contradiction.\n\n  So if we assign the stay at T=10, we get stuck at T=14.\n\nCase 2: stay at T=11: d11=0.\n  Then:\n      T=11: y=4+d10 -> d10 must be 1 (since we have to assign five ups) -> so T=11: y=5.\n      T=12: 5 + d11=5+0=5 -> safe (not 6).\n      T=13: 5 + d12 -> if d12=1 -> 6; if d12=0 -> but we already used the stay -> so d12=1 -> y13=6.\n      T=14: 6 + d13 -> we need to avoid 7 -> so we must have d13=0 -> but we have already used the stay -> contradiction.\n\nCase 3: stay at T=12: d12=0.\n  Then:\n      T=11: y=4+d10 -> d10 must be 1 (to use one up) -> T=11: y=5.\n      T=12: 5 + d11 -> we have not used d11: must be 1 (since we have five ups) -> then T=12: y=5+1=6 -> but we are at T=12 at y=6 -> collision.\n\n  So not possible.\n\nCase 4: stay at T=13: d13=0.\n  Then:\n      T=11: 4+d10 -> d10=1 -> y11=5.\n      T=12: 5+d11 -> d11=1 -> y12=6 -> collision at T=12? because we are at y=6 at T=12 -> not allowed.\n\n  So not possible.\n\nCase 5: stay at T=14: d14=0.\n  Then:\n      T=11: 4+d10 -> d10=1 -> y11=5.\n      T=12: 5+d11 -> d11=1 -> y12=6 -> collision at T=12.\n\nCase 6: stay at T=15: d15=0.\n  Then we have to assign five ups in the first five moves? but we have six moves? and the last move is the stay. Then the position at T=16 is 4 + (five ups) = 4+5=9 -> so that's the goal.\n\n  Now the moves:\n      T=10: d10 must be 1 -> y11=5.\n      T=11: d11 must be 1 -> y12=6 -> collision at T=12.\n\nSo in all cases, we get either a collision at T=12 or at T=14.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible in 6 moves.\n\nSo the minimal is 7 moves.\n\nNow we have two valid 7-move plans.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. We found that H=7.\n\nNow we must output a sequence.\n\nWe have two sequences:\n\nPlan A (with two stays):\n\n  T=10: U\n  T=11: S\n  T=12: U\n  T=13: S\n  T=14: U\n  T=15: U\n  T=16: U\n\nPlan B (with a down and then up):\n\n  T=10: D\n  T=11: U\n  T=12: U\n  T=13: U\n  T=14: U\n  T=15: U\n  T=16: U\n\nBut wait, in Plan B:\n\n  T=10: D -> from 4 to 3 at T=11.\n  T=11: U -> to 4 at T=12.\n  T=12: U -> to 5 at T=13.\n  T=13: U -> to 6 at T=14.\n  T=14: U -> to 7 at T=15.\n  T=15: U -> to 8 at T=16.\n  T=16: U -> to 9 at T=17.\n\nBut that is 7 moves, and we end at T=17. But we only took 7 actions? Actually, we took 7 actions: T=10 to T=16. Then at T=17 we are at 9.\n\nBut in the sequence we have 7 actions. So we must write:\n\n  Turn 10: D\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n  Turn 16: U\n\nBut note: at T=13 we are at y=5? Then at T=13 we move U to y=6 at T=14 -> freeway6 at T=14 is safe. Then at T=14 we move to y=7 at T=15 -> freeway7 at T=15 is safe. Then we move to y=8 at T=16 and then to y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut we have to check T=16: at T=16 we are at y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at 18,19,20 -> safe.\n\nSo Plan B is safe.\n\nBut which one to choose? Both are minimal (7 moves). We can choose either.\n\nHowever, note that in Plan A we have two stays, and in Plan B we have a down and then a series of ups. \n\nBut the problem does not specify a preference. So we can choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose the one without going down? Plan A doesn't go below the starting point.\n\nBut the problem says minimal number of turns. Both take 7 turns. So both are minimal.\n\nWe'll choose Plan A because it doesn't go down.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: S\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: S\n  Turn 14: U\n  Turn 15: U\n  Turn 16: U\n\nBut wait: let me write the positions:\n\n  T=10: start at y=4 -> action U -> T=11: y=5\n  T=11: action S -> T=12: y=5\n  T=12: action U -> T=13: y=6\n  T=13: action S -> T=14: y=6\n  T=14: action U -> T=15: y=7\n  T=15: action U -> T=16: y=8\n  T=16: action U -> T=17: y=9\n\nWe are at y=9 at T=17, which is after 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1. Here H=7, so we take actions at turns 10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn 16, and then at turn 17 we are at 9.\n\nIs there a sequence that ends earlier? We argued that 6 is impossible. So this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we have to check the freeway at every turn we are on the freeway.\n\nAt T=10: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (T=10 not in 22,23,24)\nAt T=11: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (T=11 not in 22,23,24)\nAt T=12: y=5 -> freeway5: safe\nAt T=13: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (only dangerous at T=12)\nAt T=14: y=6 -> freeway6: safe\nAt T=15: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (T=15 not in 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> safe)\nAt T=16: y=8 -> freeway8: safe (T=16 not in 18,19,20)\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7. And the sequence has 7 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could have chosen the other plan. But this one is also valid and minimal.\n\nOne more thing: are there any other dangers? For example, at T=10, we are at y=4 and freeway4 has two cars? But at T=10, freeway4 is safe. And we are not on freeway4 at any other dangerous time? We are only at freeway4 at T=10 -> safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by strategically staying at safe positions during dangerous turns.\n\n- At turn 10, moving up to \\(y = 5\\) avoids freeway 4 at future dangerous turns (22, 23, 24).\n- At turn 11, staying at \\(y = 5\\) avoids freeway 6 at turn 12 (dangerous).\n- At turn 12, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) occurs after the dangerous turn 12 for freeway 6.\n- At turn 13, staying at \\(y = 6\\) avoids freeway 7 at turn 14 (dangerous).\n- At turn 14, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) occurs after the dangerous turn 14 for freeway 7.\n- At turns 15 and 16, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) and \\(y = 9\\) respectively, as these positions and turns are safe.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17 (after 7 actions) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,5) at turn t_1 = 12. I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis is from y=0 to y=9, and we're starting at y=5.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions that move over time. The collision rule is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you're at y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you only check for collision on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=12, and for future turns, I need to compute their spans based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway at t=12:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 4. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at t=12.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4). But head and tail: it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it should be head > tail since it's moving right, but here h=-24, τ=-35, so -24 > -35, so head is at -24, tail at -35, so the car extends from -35 to -24, which is from left to right, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at t=12: span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [-35 + 4*(T-12), -24 + 4*(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24, -35, right, 4), so same span [-35, -24] at t=12, and [ -35 + 4(T-12), -24 + 4(T-12) ] at T.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars. First: (-40, -51, right, 4), so at t=12, span [-51, -40]\n\nSecond: (24, 13, right, 4), head 24, tail 13, so span [13,24] at t=12.\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nSo at T, first car: [ -51 + 4(T-12), -40 + 4(T-12) ]\n\nSecond car: [13 + 4(T-12), 24 + 4(T-12)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, two cars: (-40,-51,right,4) and (24,13,right,4), same as above.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24,11,left,36). Left-moving, so head and tail: (-24,11,left,36), but for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and since it's left-moving, h should be greater than τ? Head -24, tail 11, but -24 < 11, so if it's left-moving, the head is at the left, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFor left-moving cars: it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and \"Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\". For left-moving, since it moves left, the head is at the left end, so h should be less than τ? In this case, h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, which makes sense for left-moving, because as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nAt t=12, span [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nThen at T, [ -24 - 36(T-12), 11 - 36(T-12) ]\n\nSince it's moving left, both coordinates decrease.\n\nSpeed is 36, which is fast.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars. First: (-40,-51,right,4), span at t=12: [-51,-40]\n\nSecond: (36,25,right,4), head 36, tail 25, so span [25,36]\n\nThird: (0,-11,right,4), head 0, tail -11, span [-11,0] at t=12.\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nAt T, first: [ -51 +4(T-12), -40 +4(T-12) ]\n\nSecond: [25 +4(T-12), 36 +4(T-12)]\n\nThird: [-11 +4(T-12), 0 +4(T-12)] = [-11 +4(T-12), 4(T-12)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-35,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2, span [-35,-24] at t=12.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at t=12. We need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=5 to y=9 is 4 turns, if we move up each time: U,U,U,U. But we have to avoid collisions on the freeways we're on at each turn.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars there, so at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible. But we start at y=5, which is freeway 5, and we need to end at y=9, which is safe.\n\nIn the path, when we are at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, we need to ensure no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nNow, for the minimum path, 4 ups would be ideal, but we need to check if at each position and turn, it's safe.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down would take more turns, so probably we want to move up as much as possible, but might need to avoid some freeways at certain times.\n\nWe start at t=12, y=5.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, and we need to check for collision on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nFor y=5 at t=12: freeway 5 has two cars: first [-51,-40] and second [13,24] at t=12.\n\n0 is not in [-51,-40] nor in [13,24], so 0 not in span, so safe at t=12.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S. But D or S would delay, so probably U is best, but we need to see future positions.\n\nSince min turns is 4, let's try to see if we can go directly up: U at t=12 to y=6 at t=13, then U to y=7 at t=14, U to y=8 at t=15, U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nNow, check safety at each point.\n\nAt t=12: y=5, as above, safe.\n\nAt t=13: player at y=6. Freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has one car: left-moving, at t=12, span [-24,11]\n\nAt turn T=13, since t_1=12, T-t_1=1, so span [ -24 -36(1), 11 -36(1) ] = [ -24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25]\n\n0 not in [-60,-25], so safe.\n\nAt t=14: player at y=7. Freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=14.\n\nFirst, compute car spans at T=14, t_1=12, Δt=2.\n\nCars on freeway 7:\n\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) → at T=14, span [ -51 +4(2), -40 +4(2) ] = [ -51+8, -40+8] = [-43, -32]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4) → [25 +4(2), 36 +4(2)] = [25+8, 36+8] = [33,44]\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,4) → [-11 +4(2), 0 +4(2)] = [-11+8, 0+8] = [-3,8]\n\nNow, at t=14, y=7, check if 0 in any span.\n\nFirst span [-43,-32], 0 not in.\n\nSecond [33,44], 0 not in.\n\nThird [-3,8], 0 is in [-3,8]? -3 <= 0 <= 8, yes, 0 is in the interval.\n\nSo collision! At t=14, if player is on y=7, there is a car with span [-3,8] which includes 0.\n\nSo unsafe.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=7 at t=14.\n\nIn the direct up path, at t=14, y=7, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways: either not be on y=7 at t=14, or be there but not when the car is at 0.\n\nBut at t=14, the car is at [-3,8], which includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9, so we have to pass through y=7 at some point, but not at t=14.\n\nPerhaps delay or something.\n\nSince min turns is 4, but direct not possible, might need more turns or different path.\n\nWe could go to y=7 at a different time.\n\nt=14 is fixed for the sequence if we go up directly, but we can choose to stay or move down to change the timing.\n\nFor example, at t=12, instead of moving up, we could stay or move down to be at different y at different times.\n\nBut moving down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's list the critical points.\n\nFirst, freeway 7 is dangerous at certain times because of the third car.\n\nThe third car on freeway 7: at t=12, span [-11,0], so at t=12, it is at position that includes 0, but at t=12, player is at y=5, not y=7, so no issue.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway k, collision if player on k and 0 in span of some car on k at T.\n\nFor freeway 7, the car spans:\n\nThird car: initial at t=12: [-11,0]\n\nAt time T, span: [-11 + 4(T-12), 4(T-12)] since head becomes 4(T-12)\n\nThe span includes 0 when -11 + 4(T-12) <= 0 <= 4(T-12)\n\nSince 4(T-12) >=0 for T>=12, the lower bound is -11 +4Δt, upper is 4Δt, where Δt = T-12.\n\n0 <= 4Δt always for Δt>=0, and -11 +4Δt <=0 when 4Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/4 = 2.75, so for Δt <=2, since Δt integer, Δt=0,1,2.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=12, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=1, T=13, span [-11+4,0+4]= [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=2, T=14, span [-11+8,0+8]= [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=3, T=15, span [-11+12,0+12]= [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, higher Δt, span moves right, no 0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, unsafe when player on it at T=12,13,14.\n\nSpecifically, collision if on y=7 at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut at t=12, player is at y=5, not 7.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 only when it's safe, i.e., T>=15.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have issues.\n\nBut let's first focus on getting to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nNow, we start at y=5, t=12.\n\ny=5 at t=12 is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct up path has problem at t=14, y=7.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=14, we need to either be at y=7 earlier or later.\n\nBut earlier: t=13, but at t=13, if we are on y=7, is it safe?\n\nAt t=13, freeway 7 spans:\n\nΔt=1, T=13\n\nFirst car: [-51 +4(1), -40 +4(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [25+4,36+4]= [29,40], 0 not in\n\nThird: [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4], yes, so unsafe at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, t=12 unsafe, t=13 unsafe, t=14 unsafe, only safe from t=15 onwards for y=7.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at some T>=15.\n\nNow, similarly, other freeways.\n\nBut let's see the path to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so we need to go through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8.\n\nFirst, check freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, (-24,-35,right,4), at t=12 span [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, span [-35 +4(T-12), -24 +4(T-12)]\n\n0 in span when -35 +4Δt <=0 <= -24 +4Δt\n\nSince -35 +4Δt <=0 implies 4Δt <=35, Δt<=35/4=8.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +4Δt implies 4Δt >=24, Δt>=6\n\nSo for Δt from 6 to 8 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔt=6, T=18, span [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=7, T=19, [-35+28, -24+28]= [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=8, T=20, [-35+32, -24+32]= [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=9, T=21, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe on y=8 at t=18,19,20.\n\nBut at other times, safe.\n\nNow, freeway 6: left-moving car, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nAt t=12, span [-24,11]\n\nAt T, [ -24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt ] where Δt=T-12\n\n0 in span when -24 -36Δt <=0 <= 11 -36Δt\n\nSince the car is moving left, both ends decreasing.\n\nLower bound -24-36Δt <=0 always for Δt>=0? -24-36Δt <=0 implies -36Δt <=24, multiply by -1 (reverse inequality), 36Δt >= -24, always true since Δt>=0.\n\nUpper bound 0 <= 11 -36Δt implies 36Δt <=11, Δt <=11/36 <1, so only Δt=0, T=12.\n\nAt T=12, span [-24,11], 0 in it? -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nBut at t=12, player is not on y=6, so no issue.\n\nFor T>12, Δt>=1, 11-36Δt <= 11-36= -25 <0, so upper bound negative, lower bound more negative, so 0 not in span.\n\nFor example, at t=13, Δt=1, span [-24-36, 11-36]= [-60,-25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other times, always negative, so never includes 0 except at t=12, but player not there.\n\nSo freeway 6 is always safe for t>12.\n\nAt t=12 it is unsafe, but player not on it.\n\nNow freeway 5: at t=12, cars: [-51,-40] and [13,24], both not contain 0.\n\nAt T, first car span: [-51 +4Δt, -40 +4Δt], since right-moving.\n\n0 in if -51+4Δt <=0 <= -40+4Δt\n\n-51+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=51, Δt<=12.75\n\n0 <= -40+4Δt => 4Δt >=40, Δt>=10\n\nSimilarly, second car: [13+4Δt,24+4Δt], both positive for Δt>=0, since min at Δt=0, 13>0, so 0 not in.\n\nFirst car unsafe when Δt from 10 to 12 inclusive? Let's see.\n\n-51+4Δt <=0 <= -40+4Δt\n\nLower bound <=0: -51+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=51 => Δt <=12.75, so Δt<=12\n\nUpper bound >=0: 0 <= -40+4Δt => 4Δt >=40 => Δt >=10\n\nSo for Δt=10,11,12, T=22,23,24\n\nAt Δt=10, T=22, span [-51+40, -40+40]= [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=11, T=23, [-51+44, -40+44]= [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=12, T=24, [-51+48, -40+48]= [-3,8], 0 in\n\nBut at t=12, Δt=0, not in range, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4,3,2,1 similar to 5 or others, but since we might not go there, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 1: car [-35,-24] at t=12, right-moving.\n\n0 in span when -35+4Δt <=0 <= -24+4Δt\n\n-35+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <=8.75, Δt<=8\n\n0 <= -24+4Δt => 4Δt >=24 => Δt >=6\n\nSo unsafe at T=18,19,20 as before, but for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: cars at t=12: first [-51,-40], second [13,24]\n\nSame as freeway 5, unsafe at T=22,23,24 for the first car, but second car always safe.\n\nBut since we are going up, we care about y=6,7,8 mainly.\n\ny=4 and below might not be relevant if we go up.\n\nBut we could move down, but probably not necessary.\n\nNow back to the issue: we need to get to y=9.\n\nTo go from y=5 to y=9, min 4 moves, but with constraint that we cannot be on y=7 at t=13,14, and must be at T>=15.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=13 we are at y=6, t=14 at y=7 (unsafe), t=15 at y=8, etc.\n\nBut at t=14, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nOne way is to stay at y=5 or y=6 for an extra turn to delay reaching y=7.\n\nFor example, at t=12, instead of moving up, we stay or move down, but moving down might not help.\n\nStart at t=12, y=5, safe.\n\nOption 1: move up to y=6 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=6, freeway 6: as before, at t=13, Δt=1, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, from here, if we move up to y=7 at t=14, but at t=14, y=7 is unsafe as we saw.\n\nWe could stay at y=6 for t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=6, freeway 6: Δt=2, T=14, span [-24-72, 11-72]? Δt=T-12=2, span [ -24 -36(2), 11 -36(2) ] = [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96, -61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can move to y=7.\n\nAt t=15, y=7, freeway 7: Δt=3, T=15.\n\nSpans:\n\nFirst car: [-51 +4(3), -40 +4(3)] = [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [25+12,36+12]= [37,48], 0 not in\n\nThird: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSo safe at t=15, y=7.\n\nThen at t=16, move to y=8.\n\nAt t=16, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: car at T=16, Δt=4, span [-35 +4(4), -24 +4(4)] = [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=17, move to y=9.\n\nAt t=17, y=9, which is not a freeway, safe, and we reached.\n\nNow, sequence: from t=12 to t=17, 5 turns? Let's list:\n\nTurn t=12: at y=5, we need to choose action.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state is at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t_1, which is the current turn.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars at t.\n\nFor the sequence, we need actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nStart: turn t_1=12, position (0,5)\n\nWe choose a_{12}, which will set y_{13}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt t=12, y=5, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nIn the path I thought: at t=12, we can choose to stay or move up.\n\nIf we move up, a_{12} = U, then y_{13} = 5 +1 =6\n\nThen at t=13, y=6, we can choose to stay, a_{13} = S, then y_{14} =6 (since stay)\n\nThen at t=14, y=6, we choose a_{14} = U, then y_{15} =6+1=7\n\nAt t=15, y=7, we choose a_{15} = U, then y_{16} =7+1=8\n\nAt t=16, y=8, we choose a_{16} = U, then y_{17} =8+1=9\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\nt=12: y=5, freeway 5, cars: as before, no car at 0, safe.\n\nt=13: y=6, freeway 6, car span: at t=13, Δt=1, [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=14: y=6, freeway 6, at t=14, Δt=2, span [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=15: y=7, freeway 7, at t=15, Δt=3, spans: first [-51+12,-40+12]=[-39,-28], second [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], third [-11+12,12]=[1,12], all no 0, safe.\n\nt=16: y=8, freeway 8, at t=16, Δt=4, span [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=17: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=17, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: from t=12 to t=16, we have actions for 5 turns? Let's see.\n\nWe started at t=12, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, at t=13, y=6 (if U)\n\nThen after a_{13}, at t=14, y=6 (if S)\n\nThen after a_{14}, at t=15, y=7 (if U)\n\nAfter a_{15}, at t=16, y=8 (U)\n\nAfter a_{16}, at t=17, y=9 (U)\n\nSo we reached y=9 at t=17.\n\nThe number of turns: from t=12 to t=16 inclusive for actions, that's 5 actions, and we reach at t=17.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=12,13,14,15,16: 5 actions, then at t=17, y=9.\n\nH should be the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so indices t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so τ from 0 to H-1 for actions.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1, the position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's see the update.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t_1, y_{t_1} given.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd the actions are from τ=0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + τ} for τ=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H actions.\n\nIn my earlier path, with 5 actions: a12 to a16, then y17=9.\n\nBut is there a way with 4 actions?\n\nMinimal is 4, but with collision at t=14 if we go directly.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we move up faster or slower.\n\nAt t=12, y=5.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at t=13, then to y=7 at t=14, but at t=14 y=7 unsafe.\n\nCannot avoid that in 4 turns.\n\nPerhaps move down first, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother idea: at t=12, stay at y=5, so a12=S, then y13=5.\n\nThen at t=13, y=5, which might be safe or not.\n\nAt t=13, freeway 5: Δt=1, T=13.\n\nCars: first car [-51+4(1), -40+4(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in\n\nSecond car [13+4,24+4]=[17,28], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen we can move up to y=6 at t=14, a13=U, y14=6.\n\nAt t=14, y=6, freeway 6, as before, Δt=2, span [-96,-61], safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=15, a14=U, y15=7.\n\nAt t=15, y=7, as before, Δt=3, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=16, a15=U, y16=8.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=17, a16=U, y17=9.\n\nSame as before, 5 actions: a12=S, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, y17=9.\n\nBut we reach at same time.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U.\n\nIn this one, a12=S, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U.\n\nBoth take 5 actions to reach at t=17.\n\nBut in the first, at t=13 and t=14 we were at y=6, in second at t=13 at y=5, t=14 at y=6.\n\nNow, with 4 actions, it seems impossible because to go from y=5 to y=9 in 4 moves, we must be at y=6 at t=13, y=7 at t=14, y=8 at t=15, y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=14, y=7 is unsafe, as established.\n\nWe cannot be at y=7 at t=14.\n\nIf we go up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so we must pass through each y.\n\nUnless we skip, but no, y changes by at most 1, so from y=5 to y=9, must go through 6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, at some point, we are at y=7 at time T, and T cannot be 13 or 14, must be 15 or later.\n\nIn a 4-turn sequence, the times are fixed: t=13,14,15,16 for positions after actions.\n\nAfter 4 actions, from t=12 to t=15 for actions, y at t=16.\n\nActions: a12, a13, a14, a15 → positions: after a12, y13; after a13, y14; after a14, y15; after a15, y16.\n\nWe want y16=9.\n\ny13 must be 6 or 7 or something, but from y12=5, to y16=9, in 4 steps, the y values: let’s say y13 = y12 + Δy12, etc.\n\ny13 = 5 + a12 effect\n\ny14 = y13 + a13 effect\n\ny15 = y14 + a14 effect\n\ny16 = y15 + a15 effect\n\nAnd y16=9.\n\nSince each change is -1,0,1, and y starts at 5, ends at 9, so net change +4, so must have four +1 changes, no down or stay, because if any stay or down, net change less than 4, cannot reach 9 in 4 steps from 5.\n\nIf all up: y13=6, y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nBut at t=14, y14=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we have a down or stay, say one stay, then y13=5 or 6, but if y13=5 (if S at t12), then to reach y16=9, need y14=6 or7, y15=7 or8, y16=8 or9, but with only 3 changes, max increase 3, so y16 <= 5+3=8 if y13=5, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y13=6, then to y16=9, need increase of 3 in 3 steps, so must all up: y14=7, y15=8, y16=9.\n\nBut at t=14, y14=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we have a down, say at some point, then even worse, y decreases, harder to reach 9 in 4 steps.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach in 4 turns with 4 actions.\n\nMinimal H is 5.\n\nNow, in my sequence, with H=5, we can reach.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I thought: a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U\n\nThen positions: t12: y=5, after a12=U, y13=6\n\nt13: y=6, after a13=S, y14=6\n\nt14: y=6, after a14=U, y15=7\n\nt15: y=7, after a15=U, y16=8\n\nt16: y=8, after a16=U, y17=9\n\nAt t17, y=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, actions from t12 to t16.\n\nH=5, actions at t12,13,14,15,16.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{12+5} = y17=9.\n\nt1 + H = 12 + 5 =17.\n\nYes.\n\nWith a12=S, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U: after a12=S, y13=5; t13 y=5, after a13=U, y14=6; t14 y=6, after a14=U, y15=7; t15 y=7, after a15=U, y16=8; t16 y=8, after a16=U, y17=9. Same.\n\nNow, we need to check if at t=16, y=8 is safe, which it is, as before.\n\nIn this path, we go through y=8 at t=16.\n\nBut freeway 8 is safe at t=16, as span [-19,-8], no 0.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach in fewer than 5? We saw 4 impossible, so 5 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for the given t1.\n\nt1=12.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to avoid other collisions, but in this path, we only went through y=5,6,7,8 at various times.\n\ny=5 at t=12 and t=13 (if we stay first, but in first sequence only t=12)\n\nIn U then S sequence: at t=12 y=5, t=13 y=6, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8.\n\ny=5 only at t=12, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=13 and t=14, both safe for freeway 6.\n\ny=7 at t=15, safe for freeway 7.\n\ny=8 at t=16, safe for freeway 8.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith S first: t=12 y=5, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8.\n\ny=5 at t=12 and t=13: at t=13, freeway 5, as we computed earlier, at Δt=1, spans [-47,-36] and [17,28], both no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in both cases, H=5.\n\nNow, the sequence can be either, but since we want minimal H, and both same, we can choose one.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we go to y=8 or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=15, we are at y=7, and we move to y=8 at t=16, but is y=8 safe at other times?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=8 earlier, but in min time, we are at t=16.\n\nBut at t=15, if we were at y=8, but from y=7 at t=15, we go to y=8 at t=16.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nPerhaps start by moving up faster, but not possible.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write one.\n\nAlso, in freeway 6, there is a car, but as we saw, it's only unsafe at t=12, but we are not there at t=12, and later it's safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6, the car has speed 36, which is high, but since it moves left fast, it's out of range quickly.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: a_{12}\nTurn 13: a_{13}\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nI think the sequence with a12=U, a13=S, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U is fine.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nSince the player is at y=5, and we need to go to y=9, but delayed due to y=7 being unsafe.\n\nAnother sequence: we could go directly to y=6 at t=13, then stay or something, but same as before.\n\nPerhaps at t=14, instead of staying at y=6, we could move to y=7, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nt_1=12.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: U  (to go to y=6 at t=13)\n\nThen at turn 13, since we need to delay, we stay: S, so y14=6\n\nThen turn 14: U, to y15=7\n\nTurn 15: U, to y16=8\n\nTurn 16: U, to y17=9\n\nAfter last action at turn 16, y17=9.\n\nH=5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turns from 12 to 16.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 17.\n\nBut turn 17 is not an action turn, it's the result.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a shorter path? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier time by moving down first or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if we move down to y=4, then come back, but that increases H, not minimal.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used stay at turn 13.\n\nWe could have stay at turn 12, but same H.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, about freeway 8: at t=16, y=8, we have span [-19,-8], safe.\n\nIf we were later, it might be unsafe, but we are early.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not an issue.\n\nIn freeway 7, we have other cars, but at t=15, they are not at 0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, and one possible sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and must reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the span of any car on that freeway contains 0 at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The direct path upward with actions \\(U, U, U, U\\) (reaching \\(y=9\\) in 4 turns) is not feasible because it would place the player on \\(y=7\\) at turn \\(14\\), where a collision occurs with the third car on freeway 7 (span \\([-3, 8]\\) at \\(T=14\\), which contains 0).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns \\(12\\), \\(13\\), and \\(14\\) due to the third car (span includes 0 at these times). It is safe only for \\(T \\geq 15\\).\n- To avoid being on \\(y=7\\) at unsafe times, the player must delay reaching \\(y=7\\) until turn \\(15\\) or later.\n- The minimum number of turns \\(H\\) required is 5, as a 4-turn sequence forces the player to be on \\(y=7\\) at turn \\(14\\), which is unsafe.\n- A sequence with \\(H=5\\) is:  \n  - At turn \\(12\\), move up to \\(y=6\\).  \n  - At turn \\(13\\), stay at \\(y=6\\) to avoid reaching \\(y=7\\) at turn \\(14\\).  \n  - At turn \\(14\\), move up to \\(y=7\\) (now safe at turn \\(15\\)).  \n  - At turn \\(15\\), move up to \\(y=8\\).  \n  - At turn \\(16\\), move up to \\(y=9\\).\n\n### Collision Check for the Sequence:\n- **Turn \\(12\\) (\\(y=5\\))**: Freeway 5 cars at \\(T=12\\): spans \\([-51, -40]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\), neither contains 0.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on the action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 14, player at y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Since we're starting at y=6, and we need to go to y=9, that's 3 units up, so minimum moves would be 3 ups, but I have to avoid cars, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but going down might not be efficient since we need to go up.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=14.\n\nThe car state is given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means it's moving right, so as time increases, the position increases. Left means moving left, position decreases.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, head and tail, but in the update, it says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is head and tail. In the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to know which one is front and back.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, if h is the head, and it's moving left, head should decrease, so if Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h is head, τ is tail, then for left-moving, head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so when moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so I think head and tail are defined based on direction.\n\nProbably, for a car, head is the front in the direction of movement.\n\nFor example, if direction is right, head is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nIf direction is left, head is the left end, tail is right end? Let's see from the update.\n\nIn left-moving case: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are given, with direction left.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so head should be the front when moving left, so left end.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is right end.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving: [h, τ] with h and τ, and since moving left, at t_1, h is the head position, which is leftmost? I'm confused.\n\nAssume that for a car, the span is from min to max, but with direction.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: at t_1, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since moving left, at time T, both decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], which might be from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume, and at T, both increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for consistency, head is the leading end, tail is trailing.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end (since moving left, left is front).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nThen in the span, for collision, we care about the interval.\n\nAt time T, for a car on freeway i, collision if player is on y=i and 0 is within the car's span at time T.\n\nPlayer is on y at time t if after action at t, y_t is the position.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nRead the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, after choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\ny_T is the position at the start of turn T or after action?\n\nDefine the state.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, the player chooses action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nNow, during turn t, when the action is taken, the position changes, but for collision, it says \"at turn T\", and \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T for collision check.\n\nThat is, at turn T, collision is checked based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nIf the player moves to a different row, they are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nSo, for turn T, position y_T is used for collision check with cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThe cars move continuously, so their span at time T is as given.\n\nTime is in turns, so discrete.\n\nt_1 is current turn, 14.\n\nPlayer at y_{14} = 6.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=14,15,... up to some H where y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we reach (0,9).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H-1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, and y_{t_1+3} =9.\n\nStarting from y_{t_1} =6, after three U, y=7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nWe start at y=6, which is freeway 6, so we need to check if at turn 14, on y=6, there is a car where 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for future positions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their spans at t=14, and then for future times.\n\nt_1 =14.\n\nFor each car, at time T, span can be computed.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find when their spans cover x=0.\n\nFor collision at turn T on freeway k, if there is a car on k with 0 in its span at T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, the cars are given.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so head is right end, tail left end. Since moving right, head should be higher x.\n\nGiven (-16, -27, right, 4), so tail = -27, head = -16? But -16 > -27, so if moving right, tail at -27, head at -16.\n\nAt t_1=14, span is [τ, h] = [-27, -16]? From the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [τ, h] with τ and h, and τ < h usually.\n\nHere τ = -27, h = -16, so span at 14: [-27, -16]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)] = [-27 + 4(T-14), -16 + 4(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, different.\n\nNow freeway 1: car: (-16, -27, right, 4) so direction right, so tail = -27, head = -16? In the tuple it's (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the update, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end, so at t_1, the span is from tail to head, so [tail, head] since tail < head.\n\nIn the update rule, it says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo here τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and since moving left, h is head (left end), τ is tail (right end), so if h < τ, then [h, τ] decreases.\n\nIn the example freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36), direction left, so head is left end, tail right end, so at t_1, span [48,83], and since moving left, at T, [48 - 36(T-14), 83 - 36(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo general: for a car, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf direction right: span(T) = [tail + s(T-t_1), head + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf direction left: span(T) = [head - s(T-t_1), tail - s(T-t_1)]  but with head and tail positions at t_1.\n\nIn terms of the given values.\n\nFor a car (h, t, d, s) at t_1, at time T:\n\nIf d = right, span(T) = [t + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf d = left, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), t - s(T-t_1)]  but since for left, head is left, tail right, so if head < tail, [head, tail] decreases.\n\nIn freeway 6, (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, so at T, [48 -36(T-14), 83 -36(T-14)]\n\n48-36ΔT to 83-36ΔT, which decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nNow, for collision, at turn T, on freeway k, if player is on k, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T, i.e., min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn 14.\n\nWe need to check for turn 14, on y=6, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6 has one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nAt T=14, span = [48 -36(0), 83-36(0)] = [48,83], since T-t_1=0.\n\n0 is not between 48 and 83, so no collision at T=14 on y=6.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and y=8 or something.\n\nSince we start at 6, we can go U to 7, U to 8, U to 9, in three moves.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when on y=7 or y=8, no collision.\n\nFirst, at turn 14, we are at y=6, no collision as above.\n\nNow, suppose we do U at turn 14, then y_{15} =7.\n\nAt turn 15, we are on y=7, need to check cars on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (-32, -43, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4)? (44,33,right,4), but 44>33, so tail=33, head=44? Let's list.\n\nCars on freeway 7: (-32, -43, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4)? (32,21,right,4), but 32>21, so tail=21, head=32? In tuple (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor first car: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so head should be right, tail left. -32 > -43, so head = -32, tail = -43? But -32 is greater than -43, so if moving right, tail at -43, head at -32.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (44, 33, right, 4), head=44, tail=33, since 44>33.\n\nThird car: (8, -3, right, 4), head=8, tail=-3.\n\nAnd all direction right.\n\nNow at time T, for each car, span.\n\nAt turn 15, T=15, t_1=14, so ΔT = T-14 =1.\n\nFor freeway 7:\n\nCar 1: (-32, -43, right, 4) so at T=15, span = [tail + s*1, head + s*1] = [-43 + 4(1), -32 + 4(1)] = [-39, -28]\n\nSimilarly, car 2: (44,33,right,4) head=44, tail=33, span at T=15: [33 +4(1), 44 +4(1)] = [37,48]\n\nCar 3: (8,-3,right,4) head=8, tail=-3, span at T=15: [-3 +4(1), 8 +4(1)] = [1,12]\n\nNow, at turn 15, if player on y=7, collision if 0 in any span.\n\nFor car 1: [-39,-28], 0 not in, since both negative.\n\nCar 2: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nCar 3: [1,12], 0 not in, min=1>0.\n\nSo no car has 0 in span at T=15 on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at turn 16.\n\nFirst, let's see the sequence.\n\nIf we do U at 14, U at 15, U at 16.\n\nAfter U at 14, y=7 at turn 15.\n\nThen U at 15, y=8 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: (-16, -27, right, 4) similar to freeway 1.\n\nCar: (-16, -27, right, 4) so head=-16, tail=-27.\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=16-14=2\n\nSpan: [tail + s*2, head + s*2] = [-27 + 4*2, -16 + 4*2] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so no collision.\n\nThen U at 16, y=9 at turn 17, which is safe.\n\nSo with H=3, actions U,U,U at turns 14,15,16, we reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut is turn 17 the time when y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 14: position y=6, action a_14=U, then y_15=7\n\nTurn 15: position y=7, action a_15=U, y_16=8\n\nTurn 16: position y=8, action a_16=U, y_17=9\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd we need to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 17.\n\nNow, collisions: at turn 14, on y=6, no collision as before.\n\nAt turn 15, on y=7, no collision as above.\n\nAt turn 16, on y=8, no collision.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 3 turns with three ups.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 14 is safe, but what about later? But at turn 14 we are there, and we leave immediately.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's check if at turn 15 on y=7, we have car spans: we have [ -39,-28], [37,48], [1,12], all not covering 0.\n\nAt turn 16 on y=8: span [-19,-8], not covering 0.\n\nSeems fine.\n\nBut freeway 7 has a car at [1,12] at T=15, which is from car 3: at T=15, [1,12], so x=0 not covered, min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do in 3 moves.\n\nBut let's see if we can do faster? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 moves up, since each move changes y by at most 1. So H=3 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we have a sequence without collision.\n\nBut is there a car that might cause issue?\n\nPerhaps on other freeways, but we only care when we are on that freeway.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 14, we are at y=6, but if we stay, might have collision later, but we don't stay, we move up.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's verify the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36) at T=14, [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nAt later times, but we are not on y=6 after turn 14.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence, we go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we need to wait or something, but here it seems not necessary.\n\nBut let's see freeway 7 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, on freeway 7.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 7 at turn 14, we are on 6.\n\nAt turn 14, position y=6.\n\nWe go to y=7 at turn 15.\n\nNow, at turn 15 on y=7, cars as above.\n\nNow, what about the car on freeway 7 with span at T=15: [1,12], which is positive, so no issue.\n\nBut let's see when this car covers x=0.\n\nCar 3 on freeway 7: (8,-3,right,4) at t_1=14, head=8, tail=-3.\n\nAt time T, span [ -3 + 4(T-14), 8 + 4(T-14) ]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -3 +4ΔT <=0 <= 8 +4ΔT\n\nSince 8+4ΔT >0 always for ΔT>=0, so only need -3 +4ΔT <=0, so 4ΔT <=3, ΔT <= 0.75, so for ΔT=0, T=14: min=-3<=0<=8 max, yes 0 in [-3,8] at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, for this car, span [ -3 +0, 8+0] = [-3,8], so 0 is in [-3,8], yes.\n\nBut at turn 14, we are on y=6, not on y=7, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 15, ΔT=1, span [ -3+4, 8+4] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in, as I had.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 15 on y=7, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 car: at T=14, span for car (-16,-27,right,4) at T=14: [τ, h] = [-27,-16], so [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=15: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=16: [-19,-8], etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), so x=0 always, we only care about when 0 is in the span.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway 3,4,5 have cars, but we are not going there, so no need to worry.\n\nWe are going from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nBut in freeway 7, at turn 15, car 3 has [1,12], which is fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is any car that might hit x=0 at the times we are on the row.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when would the car hit x=0.\n\nCar on 8: span at T: [-27 +4(ΔT), -16 +4(ΔT)]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -27 +4ΔT <=0 <= -16 +4ΔT\n\nNow, -27 +4ΔT <=0 implies ΔT <= 27/4 = 6.75\n\n0 <= -16 +4ΔT implies 4ΔT >=16, ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT from 4 to 6.75, so turns T=14+4=18 to T=14+6=20, since T integer, ΔT=4,5,6.\n\nAt T=18: min=-27+16=-11, max=-16+16=0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=19: min=-27+20=-7? ΔT=5, min=-27+20=-7? 4*5=20, -27+20=-7, max=-16+20=4, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=20: min=-27+24=-3, max=-16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nBut we are on y=8 at turn 16, which is ΔT=2, span [-19,-8], not including 0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nIn my plan, we are on y=8 at turn 16, before the car arrives.\n\nSo all seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions starting from turn t_1=14.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at 14,15,16: U,U,U\n\nThen reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut is there any reason why this might not work?\n\nFreeway 6 has a car moving left at high speed.\n\nAt T=14, [48,83]\n\nAt T=15, [48-36,83-36]=[12,47]\n\nAt T=16, [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], so at T=16, min=-24<=0<=11, so 0 in span at T=16 on freeway 6.\n\nBut at turn 16, we are on y=8, not on y=6, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we should consider if we stay or something, but we don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 7, car 3 at T=14 has span [-3,8], including 0, but at T=14 we are not on y=7.\n\nAt T=15, not including 0.\n\nSo in the sequence, when we are on y=7 at T=15, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's check freeway 5 or others, but we don't visit them.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but we are at T=16, safe.\n\nMaybe we can reach faster? No, minimum 3 moves.\n\nPerhaps if we go up twice, but y from 6 to 9, need three increments.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nAnd we have a valid sequence.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be a problem? Because freeway 7 has multiple cars, but at the time we are there, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: (-32,-43,right,4), that's car1.\n\nThen (44,33,right,4), head=44, tail=33.\n\nAnd (8,-3,right,4)\n\nAt T=15, car1: [-39,-28], car2: [37,48], car3: [1,12], all not covering 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps at turn 14, if we do something else, but no need.\n\nAnother point: the player can go down, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nOr stay, but staying might cause collision if on a row with car covering 0 later, but here at y=6, at T=16, car covers 0, but we leave before.\n\nAt y=6, if we stay at turn 14, y=6, then at turn 15, if we stay, y=6, at T=15 on y=6.\n\nAt T=15, freeway 6 car: [48-36(1),83-36(1)] = [12,47], 0 not in, since min=12>0.\n\nAt T=16, [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], min=-24<=0<=11, so 0 in span, so if on y=6 at turn 16, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are not staying, we move up.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U at turns 14,15,16.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: t_1+0=14, t=1:15, t=2:16.\n\nActions a14=U, a15=U, a16=U.\n\nThen y17=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut H=3, turns from 14 to 16.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 15 on y=7, is there any car?\n\nFreeway 7 has car at [1,12] at T=15, which is from x=1 to 12, so x=0 is not covered, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list all freeways to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: car (-16,-27,right,4) at T=14: [-27,-16], no 0\n\nT=15: [-23,-12], no\n\netc.\n\nFreeway 2: similar, (-16,-27,right,4) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-32? (h,t,d,s) = (-32,-43,right,4) so tail=-43, head=-32\n\nAt T=14: [-43,-32]\n\nAt T: [-43+4ΔT, -32+4ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (32,21,right,4) head=32, tail=21? 32>21, so tail=21, head=32\n\nAt T: [21+4ΔT, 32+4ΔT]\n\nAt T=14: [21,32] for second car, etc.\n\nBut we not on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, probably.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36) at T: [48-36ΔT, 83-36ΔT]\n\nAt T=14: [48,83]\n\nT=15: [12,47]\n\nT=16: [-24,11] 0 in if min<=0<=max, -24<=0<=11 yes at T=16\n\nBut we not on.\n\nFreeway 7: as above.\n\nFreeway 8: (-16,-27,right,4) at T: [-27+4ΔT, -16+4ΔT]\n\nAt T=14: [-27,-16]\n\nT=15: [-23,-12]\n\nT=16: [-19,-8]\n\nT=17: [-15,-4]\n\nT=18: [-11,0] 0 in, etc.\n\nNo issue for us.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, actions U at 14, U at 15, U at 16.\n\nNow output in the format.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0:14, t=1:15, t=2:16.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify the turns.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player position is always x=0, so only y matters.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- The minimal \\(H\\) to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this.\n- The sequence of actions is three consecutive \"U\" (up) actions at turns 14, 15, and 16, resulting in:\n  - At turn 14: action \\(U\\), position at turn 15 is \\(y = 7\\).\n  - At turn 15: action \\(U\\), position at turn 16 is \\(y = 8\\).\n  - At turn 16: action \\(U\\), position at turn 17 is \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Check:\n- **Turn 14 (\\(y = 6\\)):** Freeway 6 has one car: \\((48, 83, \\text{left}, 36)\\).

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and their positions change over time based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left, and for right-moving, it shifts right. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn. Importantly, if the player moves to a different freeway at turn T, they are not on that freeway until the next turn, so they don't collide with cars on the new freeway at turn T.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 15 onwards to get to y=9 quickly without colliding.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their initial states at turn 15.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -12, tail -23, direction right, speed 4.

Let's read carefully.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (h = -12, τ = -23, d = right, s = 4)\n\nSince d is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at t=15.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=4), so span [-23, -12] at t=15.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: first (-28, -39, right, 4), so span [-39, -28]? τ = -39, h = -28, d=right, so [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nAnd second (36, 25, right, 4). h=36, τ=25, d=right, so [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nThe notation says (head h, tail τ), and for right, span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as 3, (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4), so spans [-39,-28] and [25,36]\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4), spans [-39,-28] and [25,36]\n\nFreeway 6: (12,47,left,36). d=left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [12,47] at t=15.\n\nh=12, τ=47, so [12,47] for left-moving.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-28,-39,right,4) → [-39,-28], (48,37,right,4) → [37,48], and (12,1,right,4) → [1,12]\n\nd=right for all, so [τ,h] for each.\n\nFirst: τ=-39, h=-28, so [-39,-28]\n\nSecond: τ=37, h=48? Given (48,37,right,4), so head=48, tail=37, direction right, so [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nThird: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4) → [-23,-12]\n\nNow, the player is at y=7 at turn 15.\n\nI need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and no freeway above, but the goal is (0,9), so I just need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, and sequence from t=15 to t=15+H-1 to reach y=9.\n\ny starts at 7, so to get to 9, I need to increase y by 2. Each U increases by 1, so minimum 2 turns if I go U,U, but I might have to avoid cars, so it could take more if I need to wait or go down and up.\n\nBut since I can only move one step per turn, the shortest path in terms of moves is 2 up, but I need to check if that's possible without collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, I might be on a freeway with cars at certain times.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t_1. Set τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn 15, y=7.\n\nI need y_τ for τ from 0 to H, and at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so if I start at τ=0, after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, position after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1, player position is given, and action a_{t_1} is applied to get to turn t_1+1 position.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, after action, position changes.\n\nSo, at time T, after action a_T, position is (0, y_{T+1}? No.\n\nLet's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo, at turn t, the player is at y_t, then chooses a_t, which determines Δy_t, and moves to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision: at turn T, collision occurs if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check for collision on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf you move, you change to y_{T+1} only at the next turn.\n\nSo for collision check at turn T: it depends on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at t_1=15, and for future turns, we compute based on that.\n\nSo for turn T, car on freeway k, span is as per the movement rule.\n\nSince all cars have constant speed and direction, we can compute their span at any T.\n\nNow, player starts at y=7 at t=15.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8, y=9 is not a freeway, so when y_T=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly for y=0, but we start above.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_T=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut let's see the cars on the way.\n\nFirst, at turn 15, player is on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: spans at t=15: [-39,-28], [37,48], [1,12]\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T = k, and 0 in span of some car on k at T.\n\nFor freeway 7 at t=15, spans: [-39,-28], [37,48], [1,12]. 0 is not in any of these, since [-39,-28] all negative, [37,48] all positive, [1,12] all positive, so 0 not covered, so safe at t=15 on y=7.\n\nNow, I want to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf I go up (U) at t=15, then y_{16} = 8.\n\nAt turn t=16, y=8, on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: at t=15, span [-23,-12], right-moving, s=4.\n\nAt turn T, span for this car: since right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] with τ=-23, h=-12, s=4.\n\nSo at T, span = [-23 + 4(T-15), -12 + 4(T-15)]\n\nAt t=16, T=16, T-15=1, so span = [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 is not in [-19,-8], so safe.\n\nThen, if I go up again at t=16, a_{16}=U, then y_{17}=9, which is goal.\n\nAt t=17, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in two moves: a_{15}=U, a_{16}=U, to y=8 at t=16, then to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut is there a collision at any point?\n\nAt turn t=15: on y=7, as above, no collision.\n\nAction a_{15}=U, move to y=8 for turn t=16.\n\nAt turn t=16: on y=8, car span [-19,-8], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_{16}=U, move to y=9 for turn t=17.\n\nAt turn t=17: on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd reached at t=17, which is turn t_1 + 2, so H=2 turns? Let's see.\n\nt_1=15, actions at t=15 and t=16, to reach position at t=17.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=15 to t=16 and t=16 to t=17, so two actions, H=2, and position at t=17 is y=9.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, after action, position is at t_1 + H, with y=9.\n\nIn this case, for H=2, actions at t=15 and t=16, position at t=17 is y=9.\n\nBut is this safe? I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car on freeway 7, there is one car with span [1,12] at t=15, which is on y=7.\n\nBut at turn t=15, I was on y=7, and 0 not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, 0 not included, so fine.\n\nBut when I move to y=8 at t=16, I am on y=8 at turn 16.\n\nBut let me confirm the car movements.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, but I didn't go to y=6.\n\nIn this path, I only touch y=7 at t=15, y=8 at t=16, and y=9 at t=17.\n\ny=7 and y=8 seem safe with the cars.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 at other times, but since I'm only there at t=15, and it was safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut freeway 8 has only one car, moving right.\n\nAt t=16, span [-19,-8], not covering 0.\n\nIs there any car on other freeways that might affect? No, because collision only when on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in 2 turns.\n\nBut let me check if there is any issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if the car on y=7 at t=15 could be a problem, but no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a car, but I'm not on it.\n\nFreeway 6: (12,47,left,36) at t=15.\n\nd=left, so span [h,τ] = [12,47] at t=15.\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span = [h - s(T-15), τ - s(T-15)] = [12 - 36(T-15), 47 - 36(T-15)]\n\nBut I'm not on y=6, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in my path, I go directly up, so only y=7 and y=8 are visited.\n\ny=7 at t=15, cars: as above, three spans, none contain 0.\n\ny=8 at t=16, one car with span [-19,-8], not contain 0.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 with [1,12] at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, [1,12], so position 1 to 12, but 0 is not in, so when x=0, it is not covered, since min is 1.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, but I'm only at t=15 on y=7.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nMaybe for y=8, the car is moving, but at t=16, [-19,-8], all negative, no issue.\n\nBut let me see if at earlier or later times, but since I'm only there at t=16, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to avoid being hit when moving, but the collision is defined only when on the freeway at that turn, and only if 0 is in the span.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on the new y until next turn, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nBut let me check if for y=7, at t=15, with the car [1,12], is 0 in [1,12]? 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, so not included, so no.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut why is there freeway 6 with a fast car? But I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly is possible, but it seems so.\n\nBut let me see the answer might not be so simple, or maybe it is.\n\nAnother thing: the goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so once there, no issue.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be on y=8 or y=9 from below.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, so I need to be on y=8 at some point to go up.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=16, I am on y=8, and go up.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 that could be a problem at that time?\n\nFreeway 8 car: at t=15: [-23,-12], at t=16: [-19,-8], at t=17: [-15,-4], at t=18: [-11,0], at t=19: [-7,4], etc.\n\nAt t=17: span [-15,-4], 0 not in, since -4 to -15, all negative.\n\nAt t=18: [-11,0], now 0 is included? [τ,h] = [-11,0], so from -11 to 0, inclusive? The span includes the endpoints, I assume.\n\nThe collision occurs if 0 in span, and span is [a,b], so if a <= 0 <= b, then 0 is in.\n\nAt t=18, span [-11,0], -11 <= 0 <= 0? 0 <= 0 is true, so yes, 0 is in the span at t=18 for freeway 8.\n\nBut in my sequence, at t=18, I am not on y=8; I am on y=9 at t=17.\n\nt=17 position y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nSo for my path, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 with [1,12] at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, [1,12], 0 not <=1, so not included.\n\nAt t=14, if I were there, but I wasn't.\n\nFor example, at t=14, car on y=7, the [1,12] car, since right-moving, s=4, at t=15 it is [1,12], so at t=14, τ + s(14-15) = τ + s(-1) = τ - s, similarly h - s.\n\nτ=1, h=12, s=4, at t=14, span [1-4, 12-4] = [-3,8]\n\nSimilarly, the other cars.\n\nBut at t=14, if on y=7, span [-3,8], which includes 0? -3 <=0<=8, yes, 0 is in, so if at t=14 on y=7, collision.\n\nBut at t=15, it moved to [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, for this car, [1+4,12+4]= [5,16], not contain 0.\n\nBut in my case, only at t=15 on y=7, safe.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut perhaps for completeness, let's see if there is a reason I cannot go up directly.\n\nAnother freeway: y=6 has a fast left-moving car.\n\nFreeway 6: car (12,47,left,36) at t=15.\n\nd=left, span [h,τ] = [12,47] at t=15.\n\nAt time T, span [12 - 36(T-15), 47 - 36(T-15)]\n\nAt t=15, [12,47]\n\nAt t=16, [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11]\n\nAt t=17, [-24-36,11-36] = [-60,-25], etc.\n\nNow, 0 in span when? For example at t=16, [-24,11], -24<=0<=11, yes, so at t=16, if on y=6, collision.\n\nBut I'm not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=14, [12 -36(-1), 47-36(-1)] = [12+36,47+36] = [48,83], not contain 0.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo back to my point, going U at t=15 to y=8 at t=16, then U at t=16 to y=9 at t=17 seems safe and minimal.\n\nBut the player starts at y=7, which is freeway 7, and we have cars, but at t=15, safe.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at t=15, going down is better, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nOr staying, but why.\n\nSo H=2 should be possible.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 7 has multiple cars, including one at [1,12] at t=15.\n\n[1,12] means from x=1 to x=12, so x=0 is not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, but in the span, it includes all points between, I assume.\n\nThe collision is if 0 in span, meaning the car occupies x=0 at that time.\n\nIn this case, at t=15, on y=7, car [1,12] occupies x=1 to 12, so x=0 is free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me see if for y=8, at t=16, car span [-19,-8], x from -19 to -8, all negative, x=0 not covered.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at t=15 and U at t=16.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut the turn is given as t_0=15, but in the text it says t_1, but in the current state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 = 15\", let me check.\n\n\"Current Turn: t_0 = 15\" and \"Player Position: (0,7)\"\n\nIn the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", but in the state, it says t_0=15, probably typo, should be t_1.\n\nI think t_1=15.\n\nSo actions: Turn 15: U, Turn 16: U\n\nThen at turn 17, position (0,9)\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be up to t_1 + H -1, which is 15 + 2 -1 = 16, so actions at t=15 and t=16.\n\nNow, but let me see if there is a problem with other cars.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 have cars, but I don't visit them, so no.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 has cars at [-39,-28] and [25,36], at t=15, not near 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut why is there a car on freeway 6 with high speed? But since I don't go there, fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I have to pass through other lanes, but no, I can go directly to y=8 and y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a lane, so from y=8 to y=9 directly.\n\nBut in terms of position, y=8 to y=9 is fine.\n\nPerhaps at the point when I go to y=9, but y=9 has no cars.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut let me simulate turn by turn.\n\nTurn t=15: position y=7. On freeway 7, cars: spans at t=15: [-39,-28], [37,48], [1,12]. None contain 0, so safe. Action: U, so y_{16} = 8.\n\nTurn t=16: position y=8. On freeway 8, car: at t=16, span [-19,-8] as computed. -19 to -8, 0 not in, so safe. Action: U, so y_{17} = 9.\n\nTurn t=17: position y=9, not a freeway, no cars, safe. Reached.\n\nSo done in 2 turns.\n\nBut is there a way in 1 turn? From y=7 to y=9? But I can only change by +1, so impossible in one turn. Minimum 2 turns.\n\nIf I go down first, it would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has a car (12,1,right,4), which is (head=12, tail=1, d=right), so span [τ,h] = [1,12], yes.\n\n[1,12], min 1, max 12, 0 not included.\n\nIf it were [0,12], then 0 included, but it's not.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 6 is left-moving with speed 36, which is fast, but again, not on that lane.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to avoid being on a freeway when a car is passing x=0, but in this case, for the lanes I use, at the times I'm there, no car at x=0.\n\nFor y=7, at t=15, no car at x=0.\n\nFor y=8, at t=16, no car at x=0.\n\nAnd the car on y=8 will be at x=0 at t=18, but I'm not there.\n\nSo I think H=2 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see if the problem has a trick.\n\nThe freeway 7 has three cars, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps for the car (12,1,right,4), tail=1, head=12, so it spans from 1 to 12, so positions 1,2,...,12 occupied, x=0 free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, actions: a_{15} = U, a_{16} = U.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nIn the box, it should be written as per format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSince t_1=15.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut to be precise, in the format it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write the actions only.\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, I think the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the box, I just need the sequence.\n\nBut H is 2.\n\nNow, but let me confirm if at t=16 on y=8, with the car.\n\nFreeway 8 car: at t=16, span [-19,-8], which is from x=-19 to x=-8, all x<0, so x=0 not occupied, so player at (0,8) is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the car spans include x=0 only if the span covers it.\n\nYes.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo minimal sequence is two up moves.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt turn 15:\n- Player is on freeway y=7.\n- Cars on freeway 7 at turn 15: spans are [-39, -28], [37, 48], and [1, 12]. Since 0 is not in any of these spans, no collision occurs.\n- Action: U (move up), so position at turn 16 is (0, 8).\n\nAt turn 16:\n- Player is on freeway y=8.\n- Car on freeway 8 at turn 16: initial span at turn 15 is [-23, -12] (right-moving, speed 4). At turn 16 (T=16, T-15=1), the span is [-23 + 4(1), -12 + 4(1)] = [-19, -8]. Since 0 is not in [-19, -8], no collision occurs.\n- Action: U (move up), so position at turn 17 is (0, 9).\n\nAt turn 17, the player is at (0, 9), which is not a freeway (y=9 has no cars), so the goal is reached safely.\n\nThis sequence takes 2 turns (H=2), with actions at turns 15 and 16. Since the player can only change y by +1 per turn with U, moving directly up twice is the minimal path. No alternative sequence can achieve the goal in fewer turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Collisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=8 and need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars to worry about there. But to get to y=9, I need to be at y=8 and then move up, I think. y=9 is the top, so from y=8, moving up should get me to y=9.\n\nThe grid is from y=0 to y=9, with freeways from y=1 to y=8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at (0,8) at turn 16. I need to reach (0,9), so I need to be at y=8 and then take an action to move up to y=9.\n\nBut I might need multiple turns if I have to avoid cars.\n\nCurrently at turn 16, I'm at y=8. If I move up immediately, at turn 17, I would be at y=9. But I need to check if at turn 16, when I'm on y=8, if there's a car that could collide.\n\nCollision is checked only when I'm on the freeway at that turn. At turn 16, I'm on y=8, which is a freeway, so I need to ensure that at turn 16, for y=8, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nSimilarly, when I move to y=9 at turn 17, y=9 has no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut to move to y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn and then take U action.\n\nThe minimal H could be 1, if I can move up immediately at turn 16.\n\nSo let's check the cars on y=8 at turn 16.\n\nFrom the car state:\n\nFor freeway 8: it has (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right, meaning increasing x.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving cars, head is the front, so if direction is right, head is larger x, tail is smaller x.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nt1 is the current turn, which is 16.\n\nSo for each car, we need the span at turn T.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, we care about whether 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if player is on y=k, and 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T, collision.\n\nNow for y=8 at turn 16:\n\nCar: head h = -8, tail τ = -19, direction right, speed s=4.\n\nSince direction right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-19 + 4(T-16), -8 + 4(T-16)]\n\nAt T=16, span = [-19 + 0, -8 + 0] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 is not in [-19,-8], since -19 to -8, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSo at turn 16, on y=8, no collision, since 0 not in span.\n\nTherefore, I can stay at y=8 or move, but since I need to go to y=9, I should move up.\n\nAt turn 16, I take action a_{16}, which determines y_{17}.\n\nIf I take U at turn 16, y_{17} = y_{16} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn 17, I am at (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nNow, at turn 16, when I take the action, I am on y=8, and we checked no collision.\n\nAt turn 17, I am on y=9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSo I should be able to reach in one turn.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the number of turns.\n\nLet me read the answer format.\n\nIt says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1 is 16, so for t=0, a_{16}, t=1, a_{17}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, I should be at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position is for turn t+1.\n\nStart: turn t1, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position (0, y_{t1+1})\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, position (0, y_{t1+2})\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and I am at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nI need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nt1 + H - 1 is the turn when position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then t1 + H - 1 = t1 +1 -1 = t1, so y_{t1} =9, but at turn t1, I am at y=8, so y_{t1} is 8, not 9.\n\nIf I take no action, I stay, but I need to reach 9.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given as (0,8), so y_{t1} =8.\n\nAfter first action at t1, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nI need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H - 1, so at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are from t1 to t1+H-1, which affect positions from t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nThe position at turn t is determined before action at t is taken? No.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn t, position is (0, y_t), then I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, then I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and after that, at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9 means at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nTo have that, the action at t1+H-2 affects it, or something.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nLet k be the number of actions.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y_{t1} =8.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t1), at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}\n\nAfter 2 actions (at t1 and t1+1), at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δa_{t1+1} = (y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}) + Δa_{t1+1}\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter H actions (at t1 to t1+H-1), I am at turn t1+H, with y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut I need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTo reach that position, I need actions up to a_{t1+H-2}, because a_{t1+H-2} determines y_{t1+H-1} from y_{t1+H-2}.\n\nLet T = t1 + H - 1, so y_T =9.\n\nThen the actions that affect positions up to T are from t1 to T-1, because a_t determines y_{t+1}, so for y_T, it is determined by a_{T-1} from y_{T-1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach y_T =9 starts from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, and H = number of actions = (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nSince T = t1 + H - 1, so H = T - t1 + 1? Let's solve.\n\nFrom T = t1 + H - 1, then H = T - t1 + 1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1 inclusive, which is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nBut H is defined as the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it's {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, y must be 9.\n\nFor that, the action at t1+H-2 determines y_{t1+H-1} from y_{t1+H-2}, so the actions up to a_{t1+H-2} affect it.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me set the target turn.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThen, the actions taken from turn t1 to T-1 determine how I get there.\n\nThe number of actions is K = T - t1.\n\nThen the sequence is actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+K-1, and after that, at turn t1+K, y_{t1+K} =9 if I reached at turn T = t1+K.\n\nBut in the problem, it says y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, so T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nAnd actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if I reach at turn t1, but y_{t1} =8, not 9, so T cannot be t1.\n\nIf I reach at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} =9, then T = t1+1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H - 1} =9, so t1 + H - 1 = t1+1, thus H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nThen actions from t1 to t1+H-1 = t1 to t1+1, so two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nBut a_{t1} determines y_{t1+1}, so if I take U at t1, y_{t1+1} =9, then at turn t1+1, I am at y=9.\n\nThen a_{t1+1} is the action at turn t1+1, which could be anything, but since I'm already at y=9, I might not need to do anything, but the sequence includes it.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once I'm there, I can stop, but the sequence might include actions after, but for minimal H, we should stop when we reach.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", so the actions are taken to reach the position, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, the position is set, but we need y at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nI think there's a off-by-one issue.\n\nLet me look back at the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nAlso, from the dynamics, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, take a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} =8.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, t1 + H -1 = t1, so y_{t1} =9, but it is 8, impossible.\n\nFor H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1+1, so y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nThis is achieved by taking a_{t1} such that y_{t1} + Δy_{t1} =9, so since y_{t1}=8, Δy= +1, so a_{t1} = U.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1=1, so a_{t1+0} = a_{t1}, and that's it for H=2? H=2, t from 0 to 1, so two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nBut a_{t1} sets y_{t1+1} to 9, then at turn t1+1, I am at y=9, so I don't need to do anything, but I have to take an action a_{t1+1}, which could be S, for example.\n\nThen y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1} =9 +0 =9, but we need y_{t1+1} =9, which is already satisfied.\n\nBut for H=2, we have two actions, but only the first is needed to reach, the second is after reaching.\n\nThe position is reached at turn t1+1 with y=9, and we have action at turn t1+1, which doesn't change the position for that turn, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nFor minimal H, we want the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor H=2, we can be at y=9 at turn t1+1.\n\nWith one action: a_{t1} = U, then at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nThen the sequence has two actions if H=2, but the second action a_{t1+1} is at turn t1+1 when we are already at y=9, so it can be S or U or D, but U might go to 10, but y is capped at 9, so y_{t1+2} = min(9, y_{t1+1} +1) = min(9,10) =9 if U, or 9 if S, or 8 if D, but since we need y at turn t1+1 to be 9, it is, but for the action at t1+1, it doesn't affect y at t1+1, only y at t1+2.\n\nSo for reaching at turn t1+1, we only need a_{t1}, but the sequence for H=2 includes a_{t1+1}, which is unnecessary for reaching, but we have to include it because the sequence has H actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we should choose the smallest H such that it is possible to have y_{t1 + H - 1} =9 with some sequence.\n\nFor H=1, t1 + H -1 = t1, y_{t1} =8 ≠9, impossible.\n\nFor H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1+1, we can have y_{t1+1} =9 by taking a_{t1} = U, and then a_{t1+1} can be anything, say S.\n\nThen y at turn t1+1 is 9, as required.\n\nSimilarly, for H=1, it's impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 2, with actions a_{t1} = U and a_{t1+1} = S, for example.\n\nBut in this case, for our problem, at turn 16, if I can move up immediately, I should be able to reach at turn 17.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nIn this case, for H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nPosition at turn t1: y=8, on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn t1+1: y=9, not on freeway.\n\nCollision only checked when on freeway, so at turn t1, on y=8, we need no collision, which we checked earlier for turn 16.\n\nAt turn t1+1, on y=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo with a_{16} = U, and say a_{17} = S, we reach y_{17} =9 at turn 17, which is t1+1 =16+1=17, and t1 + H -1 =16 +2 -1=17, yes.\n\ny_{17} =9.\n\nAnd for the action at turn 17, we take S, but it doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify both actions.\n\nBut for minimal H, H=2 seems possible.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars?\n\nAt turn 16, on y=8, car span [-19,-8], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I move up, at turn 17, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo why would I need more turns?\n\nBut I need to make sure that during the move, no collision.\n\nThe collision is only when I am on a freeway at that turn.\n\nWhen I move from y=8 to y=9, at turn 16, I am on y=8, so collision check at turn 16 for y=8.\n\nAt turn 17, I am on y=9, no check.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the car update.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=16.\n\nFor other freeways, I might need to move through them, but in this case, I am starting at y=8 and moving directly to y=9, so I only care about y=8 at turn 16.\n\nAnd it's safe.\n\nBut the player position is at (0,y), so x=0 always.\n\nCars are on the freeways, and we care about whether x=0 is in their span at that turn.\n\nFor y=8 at t=16, span [-19,-8], x=0 not in, so ok.\n\nPerhaps for other turns if I stay or something, but here I move immediately.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it with H=1, but impossible as above.\n\nH=2 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, there are cars on other freeways, but since I don't go there, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I have to move down or something, but no, I can go directly up.\n\nBut y=8 to y=9, moving up.\n\nBut let me check the car on y=8.\n\nAnother thing: the car is moving, but at turn 16, it's at [-19,-8], and since it's moving right, at later turns, it might approach, but at turn 16, it's fine, and I'm only at y=8 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 17, I'm not on y=8, so no issue.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one action, but with H=2 turns meaning two actions.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, with H=2, actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S  (or anything)\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason why I cannot move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps at turn 16, on y=8, but if I move up, is there a car on y=9? No, y=9 no cars.\n\nOr during the move, but the collision is per turn, not during the move.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1)\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T=16, I am on y=8, and I move to y=9 for turn 17.\n\nAt turn 16, I am not on y=9, so even if there were cars on y=9, but there aren't, it wouldn't matter.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can just move up at turn 16.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nAt t=16, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with T=16, t1=16, so [ -19 +0, -8 +0] = [-19,-8], x=0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I stay or move, but I move up.\n\nPerhaps the player is on the grid point, and cars are on the freeway, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? Maybe if I had to go through lower y, but I don't need to, I'm already at y=8.\n\ny=8 is the second highest freeway, y=9 is above.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8, so y=8 is freeway, y=9 is not.\n\nFrom y=8, move up to y=9.\n\nSo I think it's possible.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=6, for example, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I should verify if at turn 16, for y=8, is there any car that has 0 in span? No.\n\nMaybe for later actions, but with H=2, I only have turn 16 and 17.\n\nAt turn 17, I'm at y=9, no issue.\n\nSo I think minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nWith H=2:\n\nAction at t1: U\n\nAction at t1+1: S (stay, for example)\n\nThen at turn t1+1=17, y=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{16+2-1} = y_{17} =9, good.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=0 to H-1=1, so a_{16} and a_{17}.\n\nNow, for a_{17}, I set to S, but it could be U or D, but since y=9, U would try to go to 10, but capped at 9, so y_{18} still 9, but we don't care.\n\nSo in the answer, I can put:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut is there a reason why this might not work? Perhaps I need to check if at turn 16, when I take U, but the action doesn't affect the current position, only the next.\n\nPosition at turn 16 is fixed, I take action, go to turn 17.\n\nCollision at turn 16 depends on position at turn 16, which is given.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the car on y=8 is moving, and at turn 16 it's safe, but if I stay, it might hit later, but I'm not staying.\n\nSo for this case, H=2 should work.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways; maybe the problem is that I need to start from (0,8) but perhaps there is a car coming or something, but at turn 16 it's clear.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a car (-24,11,left,36), direction left, so moving left, decreasing x.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHead and tail: given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front, so if direction left, head has smaller x? Let's see the update.\n\nCar update rules:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the initial state, for a car, it gives (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nSince direction right, Span(t1) should be [τ, h], so τ = -19, h = -8, so [ -19, -8 ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like on freeway 6: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 -36(T-16), 11 -36(T-16)]\n\nBut for our purpose, at turn 16, for y=8, we have the car as above.\n\nBut since I'm only concerned with turn 16 for y=8, and it's safe, I think I can go.\n\nPerhaps the player must not collide at any turn during the sequence.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=8 for multiple turns, I might collide later, but here I move immediately.\n\nSo for H=2, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me assume that I need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for t1=16, H=2.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: S\n}\n\nBut is S necessary? I could put U again, but it doesn't matter.\n\nTo be safe, put S.\n\nBut let me see if there is any car that could cause problem.\n\nAnother thought: when I am at y=8 at turn 16, and I move to y=9 at turn 17, is there a car on y=8 at turn 17 that I might be considered on? No, at turn 17, I am on y=9, so no.\n\nThe collision is only at the turn when I am on the freeway.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, there are multiple cars, but I don't go there.\n\nSo I think H=2 is minimal and possible.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,8), and I need to reach (0,9), so moving up is direct.\n\nBut why is there information about other freeways? Maybe if I were at lower y, I might need to navigate, but here I'm at y=8 already.\n\nPerhaps at turn 16, on y=8, it is safe, but let's confirm the span.\n\nCar on y=8: head -8, tail -19, right, speed 4.\n\nAt T=16, span [ -19, -8 ] since for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-19,-8].\n\n0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I were to stay, at T=17, span [-19 +4(1), -8 +4(1)] = [-15,-4], still 0 not in.\n\nAt T=18, [-11,0], now 0 is included, since [ -11, 0], 0 is the endpoint, so if 0 is in the span, collision occurs.\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume.\n\n\"0 ∈ Span(T)\" , so if 0 is endpoint, it is included.\n\nSo at T=18, if I were on y=8, span [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nBut in our case, I move at turn 16, so not on y=8 at turn 17 or later.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, I can move up immediately.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible, but no, as y_{16} =8 ≠9.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, with H=2, we have two actions.\n\nPerhaps for the action at turn 17, since I'm at y=9, I can choose any, but to be consistent, put S.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be for the given t1.\n\nt1=16.\n\nSo actions at turn 16 and 17.\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut let's write the box.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and I think I am.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and why are there other cars? Maybe for this specific state, it is simple.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn 16, when I am at (0,8), but the car on y=8 is at [-19,-8], and I am at x=0, which is not in, but maybe for other freeways, if I had to move, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps the player can only move to adjacent y, but from 8 to 9 is adjacent.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, it is not a freeway, but the goal is to be there.\n\nSo I think I should go with this.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 7, for example.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor each, at T, span [τ + s(T-16), h + s(T-16)]\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, so span at T: [-35 +4(T-16), -24 +4(T-16)]\n\nAt T=16: [-35,-24]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (52,41,right,4), τ=41? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (head, tail, direction, speed), direction right, so head should be larger, tail smaller, so h=52, τ=41, span at t1: [41,52]\n\nAt T: [41 +4(T-16), 52 +4(T-16)]\n\nAt T=16: [41,52]\n\n0 not in.\n\nThird car: (16,5,right,4), h=16, τ=5, span at t1: [5,16]\n\nAt T: [5+4(T-16), 16+4(T-16)]\n\nAt T=16: [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nBut at T=17, for example, first car: [-35+4,-24+4]= [-31,-20]\n\nSecond: [41+4,52+4]= [45,56]\n\nThird: [5+4,16+4]= [9,20]\n\n0 not in any.\n\nAt T=18, third car: [5+8,16+8]= [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nWhen does it hit x=0?\n\nFor first car, [-35 +4(T-16), -24 +4(T-16)], set left to 0: -35 +4(dt) =0, dt=35/4=8.75, so at T=16+9=25, approximately, but not integer, at T=25, -35+4*9= -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT-16=9, T=25, span [ -35+36=1, -24+36=12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=24, dt=8, [-35+32= -3, -24+32=8] = [-3,8], 0 in? -3 to 8, includes 0.\n\n-3 <= 0 <= 8, yes, so at T=24, if on y=7, collision with first car? First car is on freeway 7.\n\nBut I don't care, since I'm not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut for us, at turn 16, on y=8, safe.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at turn 16 and S at turn 17.\n\nBut for the sequence, since H=2, we need to specify both actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: S\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo Turn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut turn 17 is t1+1.\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=2 with different actions, but this works.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 8\\), which is a freeway. The car on freeway 8 at turn 16 has a span of \\([-19, -8]\\) (since it is right-moving, \\(\\text{Span}(16) = [\\tau + s(16-16), h + s(16-16)] = [-19 + 0, -8 + 0] = [-19, -8]\\)). Since \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([-19, -8]\\), no collision occurs at turn 16.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must move up (action \\(U\\)) from \\(y = 8\\) at some turn. Taking \\(U\\) at turn 16 results in \\(y_{17} = y_{16} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n- At turn 17, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n- The sequence requires \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). For \\(H = 2\\), \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16 + 2 - 1 = 17\\), and \\(y_{17} = 9\\) is achieved.\n- The minimal \\(H\\) is 2, as \\(H = 1\\) would require \\(y_{16} = 9\\), but \\(y_{16} = 8\\), which is impossible.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 16, action \\(a_{16} = U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(a_{17} = S\\) (stay) is chosen since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\). Any action (\\(U\\), \\(D\\), or \\(S\\)) would keep \\(y = 9\\) (due to the cap at \\(y = 9\\)), but \\(S\\) is used for simplicity.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- At turn 16, on freeway 8: span is \\([-19, -8]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-19, -8]\\), safe.\n- At turn 17, on \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway), no collision possible.\n- No other freeways are visited, so cars on other freeways do not affect the path.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 2, with the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: S\n}",
