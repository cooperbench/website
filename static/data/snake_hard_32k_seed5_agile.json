It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction L, meaning it's moving left. Since the snake positions are given as [(3,3)], that means the snake is only one segment long right now. So, it's just the head; there's no body yet.\n> \n> The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all these to avoid moving into them.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1, and life span is 10, meaning they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, eating any food will make it grow. When it eats, the length increases by one, so after eating, it will have a body.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so it's moving left. From (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3).\n> \n> But I need to check for walls or obstacles. Walls include borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (2,3) doesn't seem to be in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> (2,3) is not an obstacle; let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (3,3) is current position. Moving left to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: from (3,3) with direction L, I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R, so I cannot move right immediately. But since it's the first move, I can choose any except reverse? No instant reverse means that if I'm moving left, I can't move right on the next turn. But since I'm choosing the action for turn 0, and direction is given as L, that means it was moving left to get to (3,3)? Let's see.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Head Direction: L\", and positions are [(3,3)], so it must have come from the right, meaning it moved left to (3,3). But since it's turn 0 and only one segment, it might be the starting point. I think for the first move, I can choose any direction except that I shouldn't reverse if possible, but since there's no previous move in the sequence, I need to consider the current direction.\n> \n> The movement constraints say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn 0, current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So from (3,3), with head dir L, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R.\n> \n> Now, moving L to (2,3) is possible, as (2,3) is not a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, since snake is only one segment, there are no body collisions to worry about yet, except that after eating, it will grow.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,2), (2,5), (2,1).

No, when you eat, the head moves to food, and tail doesn't move immediately?

Since it grew, when head moves to C, tail stays, but no: when head moves from F to C, if no eat, tail moves from S to F, so positions [C, F].\n> \n> But when you eat, at the moment of move to food, tail does not move, so positions are [F, S] for that turn.\n> \n> Then next turn, when head moves to new cell, tail moves to F, so positions become [new, F].\n> \n> Similarly.\n> \n> But for collision, when at [F,S], head at F, tail at S, if S and F are adjacent, it might be dangerous to move back, but since size 2, moving to S would cause head to hit tail, but S is the tail, so if head moves to tail, it collides.\n> \n> But in this case, from [F,S], if I move towards S, it might be bad.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 0, snake at [(3,3)], dir L.\n> \n> I need to choose action for turn 0.\n> \n> Options: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,3), that cell may have food?

It's turn 1, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment at (2,3).

So it will vanish after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, others have life span 9 or 10.\n> \n> Since it's turn 1, and life span decreases every turn including current, so for (6,2), it will last until turn 9 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N, and current turn is T, it disappears after T + N - 1 or something? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn T, life_span L, it has L turns left including this one. So after L turns, it's gone. For example, at turn 1, L=9, it will be gone after turn 9, meaning it exists from turn 1 to turn 9, and disappears at turn 10? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn T, countdown is L, then at turn T+1, it's L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, it disappears.\n> \n> When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn T, countdown = L, so after T, countdown becomes L-1 at turn T+1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, at that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 1, L=9, countdown=9. After turn 1, at turn 2, countdown=8. ... At turn 9, countdown=1. After turn 9, at turn 10, countdown=0, so it disappears, not available at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, for L=10, at turn 1, countdown=10, disappears after turn 10.\n> \n> But for decision making, since we plan actions, we need to know when food will vanish.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (2,3), head only, moving left.

After turn 10 it disappears.\n> \n> - (2,1): life_span=8, available until turn 10\n> \n> - (5,1): life_span=9 at turn 2, available longer, until turn 11.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: turn 2, I can move U to (2,5) or R to (3,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (2,5), I eat the food immediately, score +1, length becomes 2, snake positions: head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Head direction was U, and I moved U, so new direction U.\n> \n> Now, next turn, turn 3, from (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since I came from below (from (2,4) to (2,5)), so moving down would be reverse, but current direction is U, so I can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> Current head position (2,5), which has y=5, x=2.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,6): but (2,6) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,6), yes, (2,6) is listed, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (2,4): but (2,4) is where tail is, and moving down would be reverse direction? Head direction is U, so moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> - L to (1,5): (1,5) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,5) is listed, yes, cannot move.\n> \n> - R to (3,5): not obstacle, not wall, should be empty.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3, y=5, borders 0-7, not in obstacle list: obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So (3,5) is clear.\n> \n> So from (2,5) at turn 3, only possible move is R to (3,5).\n> \n> Then snake moves to (3,5), tail moves to (2,5)? Snake positions: before move, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n> \n> After moving to (3,5), head at (3,5), tail moves to (2,5), so snake becomes [(3,5), (2,5)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> Initially, turn 2 end: snake [(2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> Turn 3: move to (3,5), so head to (3,5), and the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (2,5)? Positions: the body segment at (2,4) moves to where head was, (2,5), but head was at (2,5), so now the body is at (2,5), and head at (3,5). So snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Now, at (3,5), no food mentioned, so no eat.\n> \n> Head direction: I moved right, so new direction R.\n> \n> Turn 4: from (3,5), head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse. Reverse of R is L, so cannot move L.\n> \n> - U to (3,6): y=6, x=3. (3,6) not obstacle? Obstacles: (4,6) is, but (3,6) not listed. Walls: y=6 is not border, borders y=0 and y=7, so y=6 ok. x=3 ok. So (3,6) should be empty.\n> \n> - D to (3,4): (3,4) not obstacle, empty.\n> \n> - R to (4,5): (4,5) not in obstacles? Obstacles: (4,6) is, (4,2), (4,1), but (4,5) not listed, so should be empty.\n> \n> - L to (2,5): but (2,5) is where the body is? Snake positions: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), so (2,5) is occupied by body, so cannot move there, collision. Also, L is reverse direction, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n> \n> All seem possible, but need to see if any have food or dangers.\n> \n> No food at these positions, I think.\n> \n> Foods are at (6,2), (2,1), (5,1), and (2,5) was eaten.\n> \n> (2,1) is still there, but at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the other choice: at turn 2, instead of moving U to (2,5), I could move R to (3,4).\n> \n> Then, no eat, snake still length 1, head at (3,4), direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Turn 3: from (3,4), head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, no reverse, so cannot move L.\n> \n> - U to (3,5): empty, as before\n> \n> - D to (3,3): should be empty\n> \n> - R to (4,4): (4,4) not obstacle, empty\n> \n> - L not allowed.\n> \n> Then I can go to (3,5), (3,3), or (4,4).\n> \n> But let's compare the two scenarios.\n> \n> First scenario: I eat the food at (2,5) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I must move to (3,5), no choice, then turn 4 I have options.\n> \n> But after moving to (3,5) on turn 3, snake is [(3,5), (2,5)], length 2.\n> \n> Now, on turn 4, from (3,5), I can go U, D, or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (3,6), or D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is empty, but let's see the food.\n> \n> There is food at (2,1), (6,2), (5,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is south-west.\n> \n> (5,1) at x=5,y=1.\n> \n> (6,2) at x=6,y=2.\n> \n> Also, the snake is at (3,5) and (2,5), so y=5 is high, y=1 is low.\n> \n> To reach (2,1), I need to go down and left.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> List obstacles again: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so at x=1, y=4 and y=5 are blocked, so I cannot go to x=1 from the left easily.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is obstacle, so above (2,5) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 2 choice.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,4) on turn 2, I don't eat, length 1, head at (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> Then turn 3, I can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3), or R to (4,4).\n> \n> (3,5) has no food, (3,3) no food, (4,4) no food.\n> \n> Then I can move towards other food.\n> \n> But the food at (2,5) has life span 8, so it will be there for several turns, I can eat it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is also at x=2,y=1.\n> \n> But if I move to (3,4) on turn 2, then on turn 3 I can move to (3,5) for example.\n> \n> But (3,5) is the same position as in the first scenario.\n> \n> In first scenario, after eating (2,5) on turn 2, I am forced to (3,5) on turn 3 with a tail.\n> \n> If I don't eat on turn 2, I go to (3,4) on turn 2, then to (3,5) on turn 3, no tail, so I can eat (2,5) on turn 3? On turn 3, if I am at (3,5), and (2,5) is adjacent, but (2,5) has food, but to eat it, I need to move left to (2,5).\n> \n> But from (3,5), moving left to (2,5) is possible only if it's empty, but if I didn't eat it, it should be there.\n> \n> Case 1: I eat on turn 2, so on turn 3 (2,5) is occupied by body, so I cannot go back.\n> \n> Case 2: I don't eat on turn 2, so on turn 3, (2,5) still has food, and I am at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) to eat it, if possible.\n> \n> But from (3,5), head direction after moving to (3,5) from (3,4) would be? Let's see.\n> \n> At turn 2, move R to (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> Turn 3, move U to (3,5), so now direction U.\n> \n> Then I can move L, U, R, not D.\n> \n> L to (2,5): (2,5) has food, and it's adjacent, so I can move there to eat.\n> \n> Then snake grows to [(2,5), (3,5)]? Head at (2,5), body at (3,5).\n> \n> Then tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Compared to case 1 where I ate on turn 2, by turn 3 I have snake at (3,5) and (2,5), same positions but head and body swapped? In case 1: after turn 3, snake [(3,5), (2,5)] head at (3,5), body at (2,5)\n> \n> In case 2: after eating on turn 3, snake [(2,5), (3,5)] head at (2,5), body at (3,5)\n> \n> But (2,5) is the same cell, but in one case it's head, in other it's body, but positions are the same, just the head is different.\n> \n> In terms of future moves, if head is at (2,5), I have different options.\n> \n> But in both cases, by turn 3 end, the snake has two segments: one at (2,5) and one at (3,5), but in different order.\n> \n> In case 1 (ate turn 2): turn 3 end: head at (3,5), tail at (2,5)\n> \n> In case 2 (ate turn 3): turn 3 end: head at (2,5), tail at (3,5)\n> \n> Now, from head at (2,5), as we saw earlier, only possible move is R to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail? In case 2, tail is at (3,5), so if I move to (3,5), it's the tail, but in snake, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move away, so no collision if it's only the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here no food on tail, just moving to tail cell is ok.\n> \n> So from (2,5) with head, moving to (3,5) where tail is, is allowed, and after move, head at (3,5), tail moves to where the body was, but since only two segments, tail was at (3,5), but head moves to (3,5), so the segment that was tail is removed or something? No.\n> \n> Positions: before move, head at (2,5), body at (3,5) — in this case, the body is the tail.\n> \n> So when I move head to (3,5), the new head is at (3,5), and the tail (which was at (3,5)) moves to where the previous head was? No.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments follow the head. So when head moves from A to B, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Here, segments: index 0: head at (2,5), index 1: tail at (3,5)\n> \n> Move head to (3,5), so new head at (3,5), and the tail (index 1) moves to the previous position of index 0, which is (2,5).\n> \n> So new snake: head at (3,5), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Same as in case 1 after turn 3.\n> \n> So essentially, by turn 3 end, in both paths, I end up with snake at (3,5) head and (2,5) tail, and I have eaten one food, score +1.\n> \n> In case 1: I ate on turn 2, moved to (3,5) on turn 3.\n> \n> In case 2: I moved to (3,4) on turn 2 (no eat), then to (3,5) on turn 3 (no eat, since no food at (3,5)), then on turn 4 I could move to (2,5) to eat, but let's not confuse.\n> \n> In case 2: turn 2: move R to (3,4), no eat.\n> \n> Turn 3: move U to (3,5), no eat (no food there), so snake still length 1 at (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (3,5), I can move to (2,5) to eat the food, for example.\n> \n> But in case 1, I already ate on turn 2.\n> \n> So the difference is when I eat the first food.\n> \n> But in terms of position, by turn 3, in case 1 I have length 2 at (3,5) and (2,5), in case 2 I have length 1 at (3,5), so not the same.\n> \n> I think I messed up.\n> \n> Let's clarify timelines.\n> \n> Option A: Move U on turn 2 to (2,5), eat food, snake now [(2,5), (2,4)]? No, positions: from (2,4) move U to (2,5), so head at (2,5), and since ate, tail remains at (2,4)? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so the tail stays for this turn.\n> \n> At start of turn 2, snake positions: [(2,4)]\n> \n> Move to (2,5), which has food, so after move, head at (2,5), and a new segment is added, so the snake becomes [(2,5), (2,4)] — head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Then turn 3: from (2,5), only possible move R to (3,5), no food there, so move head to (3,5), tail moves to (2,5), so snake now [(3,5), (2,5)] — head at (3,5), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Length 2.\n> \n> Option B: Move R on turn 2 to (3,4), no food, so snake still [(3,4)] length 1.\n> \n> Turn 3: from (3,4), move U to (3,5), no food, so snake [(3,5)] length 1.\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), which has food, so eat, snake becomes [(2,5), (3,5)] head at (2,5), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 5: from (2,5), move R to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail, so move to (3,5), new head at (3,5), tail moves to (2,5), so snake [(3,5), (2,5)].\n> \n> Same as in option A at turn 3 end.\n> \n> But in option A, I ate on turn 2, so by turn 3 I have score 1 and length 2.\n> \n> In option B, I eat on turn 4, so by turn 4 I have score 1 and length 2, but later.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,5) has life span 8 at turn 2, so on turn 4, it has life span 6 or something, still available.\n> \n> But in terms of score, I get the point later, but since all food is +1, and no penalty, it might not matter, but I need to plan for multiple food.\n> \n> There is also food at (2,1), (6,2), (5,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is at y=1, which is low, and (2,5) is at y=5.\n> \n> With obstacles, it might be hard to reach (2,1) from north because of obstacles at (1,4), (1,5), etc.\n> \n> Also, (2,6) is obstacle, so from (2,5) I cannot go up.\n> \n> Now, another thing: if I eat on turn 2, I am at (2,5) with tail at (2,4) for turn 3, and I must move right to (3,5).\n> \n> If I don't eat, I am at (3,5) on turn 3 with no tail, and I can choose to eat (2,5) or not on turn 4.\n> \n> But since (2,5) is food, I should eat it eventually if possible.\n> \n> But let's think about other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,1): at (2,1), which is below.\n> \n> To reach (2,1) from (2,4), I could go down, but at turn 2, moving D is not allowed because reverse direction; current direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> So only U or R possible, L not possible because (1,4) obstacle.\n> \n> So at turn 2, only U or R.\n> \n> If I move U, I eat (2,5), then on turn 3 I go to (3,5), then from there I need to go down to reach (2,1) or other food.\n> \n> From (3,5), on turn 4, I can move D to (3,4), or U to (3,6), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is empty, (3,6) is empty?

But let's list all obstacles.\n> \n> Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So (3,6): not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - D to (3,4): similarly, not border, not internal obstacle, free.\n> \n> - L to (2,5): but (2,5) is now the body segment? After turn 3, snake positions: head (3,5), body (2,5). So (2,5) is occupied by body. But moving to (2,5) would be body collision, except if it's the tail.\n> \n> (2,5) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (2,5)? Positions: after move to (3,5), snake is [(3,5), (2,5)], so head (3,5), and body segment at (2,5). The tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Since it's the tail, moving to (2,5) might be allowed because the tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, if I move left to (2,5), which is the tail, it should be okay, because when I move, the tail will move to the previous position or something.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move left to (2,5), which is current tail, then after move, head is at (2,5), but that cell was tail, now it becomes part of body, and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: current positions: head (3,5), tail (2,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (2,5), new head position (2,5), which was tail. Then the body segment moves to where head was, (3,5), so new snake: head (2,5), body (3,5). So (2,5) is now head, and (3,5) is body. The tail was at (2,5), but now it's head, and a new segment is added if I eat food, but no food eaten, so length same, tail is now at (3,5)? After move: from [(3,5), (2,5)], move left to (2,5), but (2,5) is current tail, so head moves to (2,5), and since no growth, the tail is removed? Standard snake movement: when moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So positions: segment 0: head (3,5)\n> \n> segment 1: tail (2,5)\n> \n> Move head to new position, say (2,5) if left.\n> \n> But (2,5) is where segment 1 is.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,5), but that cell was occupied by segment 1. Then segment 1 should move to where? Since the head moved to segment 1's position, and segment 1 was the tail, it doesn't move to a new position; instead, the tail is removed if no growth, but since we move to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it should be fine.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,5) is allowed, and after move, head is at (2,5), and the previous tail is gone, so snake is just [(2,5)]? No.\n> \n> Let's think: before move, snake: [head: (3,5), tail: (2,5)]\n> \n> Move head to (2,5). Since (2,5) was tail, head now at (2,5), and the tail segment is removed because we didn't grow, so the new snake has only one segment? But that can't be right; the body should follow.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> But if head moves to the position of the tail, then after move, the head is at the former tail position, and the body segment (which was the only one) is now at the former head position? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,5): new head position (2,5). Then the body segment at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (3,5). But since head moved to (2,5), which was index 1, now index 1 is at (3,5), but (3,5) is empty now? This is messy.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you move, the head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it, so the tail segment is left.\n> \n> In this case: from [ (3,5), (2,5) ], if head moves to (2,5), but (2,5) is already occupied by the tail, so it's collision unless handled specially.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> I think it means that when you move to the tail cell, the head occupies that cell, and the tail moves away to the next position, so no collision.\n> \n> In this setup, since the snake is only two segments, moving to the tail cell is like turning, and the tail moves to where the head was.\n> \n> So for [(3,5), (2,5)], move head to (2,5): head is now at (2,5), and the body segment (tail) moves to (3,5), so new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5). Effectively, the snake is now horizontal, with head left and body right.\n> \n> And no collision.\n> \n> If there were more segments, it would be different, but here only two.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail vacates it.\n> \n> But moving to any other body cell is deadly.\n> \n> Back to turn 4.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction R (since I moved right on turn 3).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - D to (3,4)\n> \n> - L to (2,5) which is tail, so allowed\n> \n> - R to (4,5)\n> \n> But cannot move L because opposite direction?

When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the new tail position depends on the move.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves to where it was or to the next position.\n> \n> In this case, with two segments: after move, the old head position becomes the new body, and the tail moves away if it was the end.\n> \n> Specifically: current positions: segment 0: head (3,5), segment 1: body/tail (2,5)\n> \n> After a move, say to (x_new, y_new), new head is (x_new, y_new), new body is at (3,5), and tail is gone? No, with two segments, after move, the new snake has head at new position, and the first body segment is the old head, so positions become [(x_new,y_new), (3,5)], and the old tail (2,5) is no longer part of snake, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat food, length increases, so tail stays.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten yet, so length remains 2.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5) with direction R:\n> \n> - U: (3,6)\n> \n> - D: (3,4)\n> \n> - R: (4,5)\n> \n> - L: not allowed, opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are valid.\n> \n> First, walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

to access the bottom-right area with fewer obstacles, avoiding the high-risk left side where multiple internal walls increase trap potential.

No.\n> \n> The body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed, so the new body consists of the previous head and the body segments except the last one.\n> \n> Easier: the new positions are [new_head, previous_head, previous_body1, ..., previous_body_{k-1}] for length k, but when no food, length same, but tail removed.\n> \n> Standard: after move, new head position, then the previous positions from index 0 to index n-1, where n is the number of body segments including the head? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Let's think: the snake occupies a list of cells. When it moves to a new cell without eating, the new head is at the new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the new list is [new_head] + previous_list[:-1], meaning the previous head and body except the tail are kept, with the new head prepended.\n> \n> For example, previous positions: [P0, P1, P2] length 3, P0 head.\n> \n> Move to Q, no food: new positions [Q, P0, P1] , P2 removed.\n> \n> Similarly, length 4: [P0,P1,P2,P3], move to Q no food: [Q, P0, P1, P2] , P3 removed.\n> \n> In my case, after turn 9: positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (2,1)\n> \n> Turn 10 move to (3,1) no food: new positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) ]? [Q, P0, P1, P2] and P3 removed, so [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) ] but length should be 4? No, when no food eaten, length remains the same, but the tail moves, so one cell removed from tail.\n> \n> Initial length 4, after move no food, length 4, but the tail cell changes.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) becomes body, previous body (2,2) becomes body, previous body (2,3) becomes tail, and the previous tail (2,4) is removed, so new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) ] head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (2,2), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Length 4.\n> \n> But (2,3) is now tail, whereas before it was body.\n> \n> But in terms of cells, occupied: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n> \n> (2,4) empty.\n> \n> But I digress.\n> \n> Back to (5,1): at turn 10, I am at (3,1), and (5,1) is at (5,1), dist |dx=2|, dy=0, but (4,1) is wall, so I cannot go directly.

So playable area is (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> So these are cells that are blocked, snake can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,4), (4,5)] so head is at (4,4), and tail is at (4,5). Since it's a list, head first: (4,4) is head, (4,5) is the only body segment, which is the tail. So snake length is 2.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. So currently moving down.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, since it says value1, but in the input it's written as (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Look: \" (6, 2, 4, 1) \" so (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,2) is 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone on turn t + N.\n> \n> Current turn is 6, so for (6,2), life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 6 + 4 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So if life span is L at turn t, it decreases to L-1 on turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten only if life span >=1 when head moves to it.\n> \n> But in the context, we need to see how many turns it has left.\n> \n> For (6,2): life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 7: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life span 0, disappears? But life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, with life span L, after k turns, life span is L - k. When life span <=0, it disappears.\n> \n> It disappears after N turns, meaning at the start of turn t + N, it might be gone. But let's see the countdown.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases on each turn, including current, then:\n> \n> - On turn when it spawns, life span N.\n> \n> - After one turn, life span N-1.\n> \n> - After N-1 turns, life span 1.\n> \n> - After N turns, life span 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten as long as life span >=1 when the head moves to it.\n> \n> For (6,2) at turn 6: life span 4, so it can be eaten until turn 9 (life span 1), and disappears on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,1): life span 4 at turn 6, same as above.\n> \n> - (5,1): life span 5 at turn 6, so disappears after turn 10 (turn 6+5=11? Let's: turn 6:5, turn7:4, ..., turn10:1, turn11:0 disappear.\n> \n> - (2,4): life span 8 at turn 6, so lasts until turn 13 (turn6:8, turn7:7, ..., turn13:1, turn14:0 disappear.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), moving down, so direction D, which is (x,y-1) since D is (x,y-1)? Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> In coordinates, typically y increases up, but in this case, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. But in grid, often y=0 at bottom, but here walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 bottom or top? Doesn't specify, but since U is (x,y+1), and D (x,y-1), and snake at (4,4) moving D to (4,3)? But snake positions: head (4,4), body (4,5). Head direction D, so if it moved down to (4,4) from where? Previous position: since body is at (4,5), which is above (y=5 > y=4), so head at (4,4) moved down from (4,5)? But body is at (4,5), so if head was at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4), then the body should be where the tail was, but for a snake of length 2, positions are [head, tail], so if head is at (4,4), tail at (4,5), that means the head was at (4,5) previously and moved down to (4,4), so now tail is at (4,5), and since it moved, the tail will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> But in terms of direction, head direction is D, so it is currently facing down.\n> \n> Now, from (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> First, cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So cannot move U on next turn. But since it's the next action, for turn 6, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Also, must avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border walls x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cannot go to x=0,1-6,7 or y=0,1-6,7? Cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> Now, (4,6): x=4,y=6; but y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the highest y.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6), (5,6) are at y=6.\n> \n> (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) at x=1, (4,1) at y=1, (4,2) at y=2.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (4,5) but (4,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But is this a collision?\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe because when head moves to tail position, tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for other body parts, it would collide, but here only one body segment, the tail at (4,5).\n> \n> So moving to (4,5) is safe.\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (4,3) – is this within bounds? y=3, between 1 and 6, and not wall or obstacle? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is fine. Obstacles: (4,1) and (4,2) are obstacles, but (4,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (3,4) – x=3, y=4, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are at (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(2,6),(4,1),(4,2),(4,6),(5,6), so (3,4) not there, should be free.\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (5,4) – similarly, not border, not obstacle, free.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So moving U is allowed? Opposite of D is U, so cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So for the next action, turn 6, I cannot choose U, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions for turn 6: D, L, R.\n> \n> U is not allowed because it's opposite to current D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (x,0) and (x,7) for all x, but since not playable, we care about cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles:\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list free cells or mark obstacles.\n> \n> I can think of the grid:\n> \n> y=6: x=1 to 6, but obstacles at (1,6)?

For example, (6,2) has life span 3 at turn 7, so it will be there until turn 9 (since turn 7: life=3, turn 8: life=2, turn 9: life=1, turn 10: gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So if life span is N at turn t, it means:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span = N\n> \n> - After turn t, life span decreases to N-1\n> \n> - It exists as long as life span > 0\n> \n> - Disappears when life span reaches 0, which would be after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it disappears after N turns have passed, so at the end of turn t+N-1 or something. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is N. Then:\n> \n> - During turn t, it is present, and at the end of turn, life span decreases to N-1.\n> \n> - Similarly, during turn t+1, it is present if life span >0, and decreases at end of turn.\n> \n> - It disappears when life span becomes 0, which happens at the end of the turn where life span was 1.\n> \n> So for (6,2) at turn 7, life span=3:\n> \n> - Turn 7: present, after turn, life=2\n> \n> - Turn 8: present, after turn, life=1\n> \n> - Turn 9: present, after turn, life=0, so it disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life=3, same as above.\n> \n> (5,1) life=4: present until turn 10.\n> \n> (2,4) life=7: present until turn 13.\n> \n> (4,4) life=10: present until turn 16.\n> \n> But (4,4) is under the snake's body segment. Since the head is at (3,4), body at (4,4), and food at (4,4), I can only eat it if the body moves away and then head moves to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, snake is moving left, head at (3,4), so possible moves: I can go U, D, L, but not R because that would be reverse, and head direction is L, so I cannot move right instantly. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current head direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) next turn.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5)\n> \n> - Down: (3,3)\n> \n> - Left: (2,4)\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) but right is opposite to current left, so cannot move right. Current direction is L, moving left, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> Also, need to check if cells are free or have walls/obstacles.\n> \n> First, grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I cannot go outside.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4) head, (4,4) body. Since body is moving, when I move, the tail will move away if I don't eat food.\n> \n> Now, from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – is this wall or obstacle? y=5, x=3. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, but y=5 is not border. Internal obstacles: list has (1,5), (1,4), etc., but (3,5) not in list. (1,5) is obstacle, but (3,5) is free? Obstacles are specific points: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (3,5) not listed, so should be free. Similarly, (3,4) is head, (4,4) is body but will move.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and if I eat food, tail grows, else tail moves to where the second segment was, but since snake has only two segments, let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,4), (4,4)] so head (3,4), tail (4,4).\n> \n> If I move to a new position:\n> \n> - If I don't eat food, snake becomes [new_head, old_head] so tail is removed, new position has two segments.\n> \n> - If I eat food, snake becomes [new_head, old_head, old_tail] so length increases by one.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move to a cell with food, I eat it and grow.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,4) with direction L:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: to (3,3)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: not allowed, reverse.\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (3,5): not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Body is at (4,4), so (3,5) should be free.\n> \n> (3,3): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> (2,4): let's see, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, (2,4) is within, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (2,4) is different, not listed, so should be free. Food at (2,4)? Food list: (2,4) has food with value +1, life 7.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,2), (2,1), (5,1), (2,4), (4,4)\n> \n> So (2,4) has food.\n> \n> (4,4) has food, but it's under the body.\n> \n> Now, for move to (2,4): if I go left to (2,4), I would be moving to a food cell? (2,4) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, since it's not under the body in the sense that head is moving directly to it, but the body is at (4,4), not at (2,4). (2,4) is a separate cell.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is not under snake; snake is at (3,4) and (4,4), so (2,4) is free cell with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) and (3,3) have no food listed, so probably no food.\n> \n> (4,4) has food but is occupied by body, so I cannot move directly to it; I have to move away first or something, but since it's the tail, I might be able to move to it if the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, head is at (3,4), tail at (4,4), so they are adjacent horizontally. Head is left of tail.\n> \n> If I were to move to the tail position, but I can't because I can't move right, opposite direction. But even if I could, let's think.\n> \n> Currently, from (3,4), I cannot move to (4,4) because it's opposite direction, not allowed.\n> \n> But if I could, moving to (4,4) would be moving head to where tail is. Since there is food at (4,4), and I move head to it, but according to rule, if head moves to tail cell with food, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, head at (3,4), tail at (4,4), adjacent, and tail cell (4,4) has food. If I eat it, meaning if head moves to (4,4), then after eating, the snake would grow, so new positions: head at (4,4), then since I ate, tail stays, so body becomes (4,4) head, (3,4) body, and new tail at (4,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> Original: positions [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n> \n> Move head to new position C.\n> \n> If C has food: snake becomes [C, A, B] so head at C, then A, then B.\n> \n> If no food: [C, A] and B is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,4), which is where tail B is, and it has food.\n> \n> So after move: head to (4,4), which had food, so I eat it, snake becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (4,4)]? Positions: new head at (4,4), then previous head (3,4), then tail (4,4). But (4,4) is now both head and tail? That can't be.\n> \n> The tail segment was at (4,4), but when I move head to (4,4), and since (4,4) has food, I eat it, so the tail does not move, and a new segment is added where the tail was? I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> - If food, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> Let positions be [H, S1, S2, ..., T] with H head, T tail.\n> \n> Move head to new position N.\n> \n> - If N has no food: new positions [N, H, S1, ..., S_{k-1}] if there were k segments, now tail S_{k-1} is new tail, T is removed.\n> \n> - If N has food: new positions [N, H, S1, ..., S_{k-1}, T] so T remains, and snake grows.\n> \n> In the case where N is the current tail position T.\n> \n> If head moves to T, and T has no food, then since no food, tail moves, but tail was at T, and head moves to T, so after move: head at T, then previous head H, then S1, etc., and tail S_{k-1} is new tail, T is removed. But since head and tail were adjacent, moving head to T means head and tail were on same cell? No, before move, head at H, tail at T, different cells.\n> \n> In this specific case, snake has only two segments: [H, T].\n> \n> If head moves to new position N.\n> \n> If N is not T, and no food: new snake [N, H], T removed.\n> \n> If N is not T, and food at N: new snake [N, H, T], so tail T remains.\n> \n> If N is T, meaning head moves to tail position.\n> \n> But tail position is occupied, but in snake, you can move to tail position because tail will move away.\n> \n> Generally, moving to the cell where the tail is, is safe because when you move, the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> But if there is food on the tail cell, and you move to it, you eat the food and grow.\n> \n> But in the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule, it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, with two segments: head at H, tail at T, adjacent.\n> \n> If head moves to T:\n> \n> - Since moving to T, and if there is food at T, you eat it.\n> \n> - After eating, snake grows: new positions [T, H, T]? [new head at T, then previous head H, then tail T]. But now the new head is at T, and the tail is also at T? That would be collision.\n> \n> Positions: before move: head at H, tail at T.\n> \n> Move head to N = T.\n> \n> Since N = T has food (if food present), you eat it, so the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added. So new snake: head at T, then the previous head H, and then the previous tail T. So positions: [T, H, T]\n> \n> But T is the same cell, so head at T, and tail at T, so head and tail are on the same cell, which means the head is colliding with the tail segment, so death.\n> \n> If no food, moving to T: no eat, so tail moves: new snake [T, H], and the previous tail is removed, so positions [T, H], with head at T, body at H, no problem.\n> \n> But with food, it causes collision.\n> \n> In this state, for (4,4), if I could move to it, but I can't because reverse not allowed, but if I could, it would be dangerous.\n> \n> But here, I cannot move right, so not possible.\n> \n> Back to possible moves.\n> \n> At turn 7, from (3,4), direction L, can move: U, D, or L.\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: to (3,3)\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, (2,4) has food with value +1.\n> \n> Also, need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival and score.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their expiration:\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 3 at turn 7, so present turns 7,8,9; gone turn 10\n> \n> - (2,1): life 3, turns 7,8,9; gone turn 10\n> \n> - (5,1): life 4, turns 7,8,9,10; gone turn 11\n> \n> - (2,4): life 7, turns 7 to 13; gone turn 14\n> \n> - (4,4): life 10, turns 7 to 16; but under body\n> \n> (4,4) is under the body, so I need to move away to expose it, then come back to eat it later.\n> \n> Snake is short, only length 2, so I can grow.\n> \n> Now, possible actions at turn 7:\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (2,4)\n> \n> - Go to (2,4), which has food, so eat it, score +1, snake grows to length 3.

It's turn 8, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7; those are out of bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So these cells are blocked; I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), and body at (3,4). So the snake has only two segments: head and tail. Since it's length 2, and head direction is Up (U). Moving Up increases y, so from (3,5), moving U would go to (3,6).\n> \n> Food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (6,2) value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (2,1) value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (5,1) value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,4) value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,4) value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn.\n> \n> Current turn is 8, so for food at (6,2) with life span 2, it will disappear after turn 8 + 2 - 1? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life span L, it appears at turn T, and disappears after turn T + L - 1? Or at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so when placed, countdown is L, decreases by 1 each turn, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? I think we need to be precise.\n> \n> Assume that at the turn it's spawned, countdown is L. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> For food at turn 8 with life span 2: it will disappear after 2 turns, so it's available on turn 8 and 9, gone on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 3: available turn 8,9,10, gone turn 11.\n> \n> Life span 6: available turn 8 to 13, gone turn 14.\n> \n> Life span 9: available turn 8 to 16, gone turn 17.\n> \n> But I need to think about when I can eat it.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction U.

Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, cannot be moved to.

Look at internal obstacles: (4,6), (2,6), (5,6) are obstacles, but (3,6) is not listed, so (3,6) should be free? Obstacles listed: (4,6), (2,6), (5,6) — (2,6) is listed, (4,6), (5,6), but not (3,6). So (3,6) is not an obstacle, and not a border wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> y=6 is not a border wall; border walls are y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=1 to 6 are playable except where obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6) is not in obstacles list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5): x=2,y=5, not border, not in obstacles?

Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (3,4)] head and tail.\n> \n> If I move to a new cell, say (3,6), and if no food, tail moves, so new positions: head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)? When head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so new snake: [ (3,6), (3,5) ]? Let's clarify movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves forward.

Only one segment now? Positions: after move, head at new position, and the old head becomes body, but since tail was removed, it should be [ (3,6), (3,5) ] because the segment at (3,4) is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> General rule: when snake moves, head moves to new cell. If the new cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and the new head position is added, so length increases by one. If no food, the tail moves, meaning the last segment is removed, and new head position added.\n> \n> With two segments: [head, tail]\n> \n> After move to new cell without food: tail is removed, so new positions: [new head, old head] — but old head was body, now it's tail?

No.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Example: suppose tail is at (x,y) with food. Head is adjacent, say at (x+1,y). If head moves to (x,y) to eat food, then after eating, the snake grows, so the tail segment is not removed, but the food is eaten, so new head at (x,y), and the old tail is still there, but since snake grows, a new segment is added, so positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the previous tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Normally, when not eating, moving to a cell: head moves, tail removed.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, tail not removed, so the snake extends: the food cell becomes new head, and the previous positions remain, with the tail still there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, snake [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n> \n> If head moves to C where there is food, then after move: new head at C, then A, then B, so [C, A, B], length increased.\n> \n> Now, if C is the tail position, and B is tail with food, but C is where head moves to, which is B's position.\n> \n> If tail has food, and head is adjacent, say head at P, tail at Q with food.\n> \n> If head moves to Q to eat food, then after eating, new snake: head at Q, then P (previous head), then Q (previous tail)? But Q is now head, so positions: [Q, P, Q]? That doesn't make sense; positions must be distinct.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> The food is on the cell, not on the snake. The tail cell has food means the cell where the tail is located has food on it.\n> \n> But when the snake is on a cell, the food is under the snake, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> So, scenario: tail is at position T, and there is food on cell T. Head is at H, adjacent to T.\n> \n> If the head moves to T to eat the food, then:\n> \n> - The body moves away: when head moves, the snake moves, so the tail will move if no food eaten, but here we are eating food, so tail does not move.\n> \n> But the food is on the tail cell, and head is moving to it.\n> \n> After the move: head moves to T, which has food, so we eat it. Since food eaten, the tail is not removed; instead, the snake grows. So the new positions: the new head is at T, the previous head H becomes the body, and the previous tail T is still there, but since we grew, a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, you add a new segment at the head, but the tail stays.\n> \n> Positions: before: [H, ..., T] with food on T.\n> \n> Head moves to T: so new head position is T, which had food.\n> \n> Since food eaten, the tail segment is not removed, so the previous positions remain, but with head at T now.\n> \n> The sequence: the new head is at the food cell T, then the previous head H is now the first body segment, then the rest, including the previous tail T.\n> \n> But the previous tail T is still in the list? For example, with two segments: [H, T] with food on T.\n> \n> Head moves to T: new head at T, and since food eaten, we do not remove the tail, so the snake becomes [T, H, T]? That can't be, because positions must be unique.\n> \n> I think there's a mistake.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you move to a cell with food, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail does not advance, so the snake grows by one cell. The new cell is the food cell, added to head, and tail remains, so length increases.\n> \n> Positions: for [H, T], move to food at F, which is say adjacent.\n> \n> If F is T, the tail position.\n> \n> Head moves to T, which is food, so we eat it.\n> \n> New positions: head is now at T (the food cell), and the previous head H is now the body, and the previous tail T is... since we didn't remove tail, but T is now the head, so the previous tail position is still occupied, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> I think the issue is that the cell T had the tail and food, but when the snake moves, the tail moves away if not eating, but here we are eating, so tail stays.\n> \n> But in terms of grid, before move: cell T has snake tail and food.\n> \n> After move: head moves to T, so now cell T has snake head (since head moved there), and we eat the food, so the food is consumed.\n> \n> The tail segment: since we ate food, the tail does not move, so the previous tail segment is still at T, but now the head is also at T? Conflict.\n> \n> I think this is the collision: when you move head to the tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the head is at T, and the previous tail was at T, but since tail didn't move, it's still there, but now it's the same cell, so head and body are on same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> In the sequence, new head at T, then the previous head H is the next segment, then the previous tail T is the last segment, but cell T is occupied by both head and tail, which is illegal.\n> \n> So that's why it kills the snake; immediate collision.\n> \n> Hence, tail reward danger: if head moves to tail cell when it has food, it causes collision.\n> \n> Therefore, we should not move to the tail cell if it has food and head is adjacent.\n> \n> In this state, tail at (3,4), is there food at (3,4)? Food positions: (6,2), (2,1), (5,1), (2,4), (4,4) — not (3,4), so no food at tail, so no danger.\n> \n> Similarly, head not adjacent to tail in a way that moving to tail would be issue, but head at (3,5), tail at (3,4), so they are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> If tail had food, and I moved down to (3,4), it would be bad, but no food there.\n> \n> So safe for now.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn 8.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> First, let's consider going for nearby food.\n> \n> (4,4) is at (4,4), which is close: from (3,5), to (4,4) is down-right, so I need to move right or down.\n> \n> But current direction U, so I can't move down immediately; I can move R to (4,5), then from there, I can move D to (4,4), since after moving R, direction is R, so I can move D (down) or other, not L.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is at (2,4), from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4).\n> \n> Also, other food like (6,2) is far, with short life, might not reachable in time.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) and (5,1) are at bottom.\n> \n> Let's estimate distances.\n> \n> From (3,5) to (4,4): Manhattan distance |3-4| + |5-4| =1+1=2, so 2 moves away: e.g., R then D, or D then R, but can't D first.\n> \n> Since direction U, I can only R or L or U first.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) if I choose, since after R, direction R, so D is not opposite, opposite would be L, so D is allowed.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4).\n> \n> Move U to (3,6), then from there.\n> \n> (3,6) is y=6, which is top row, and there are obstacles around.\n> \n> List the grid with obstacles and food.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1: x=1?

But for this turn, I can move U, D, L, but not R? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. But for the current turn, I can choose any direction except possibly the opposite, but the rule is for next turn, not current.\n> \n> Let's read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", meaning when deciding for turn t, I cannot choose the opposite direction for turn t if it would be instant reverse, but actually, the current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is the direction it moved to get there.\n> \n> So for turn t, when at position with direction D, I can choose to move in a new direction, but if I choose opposite, it might be invalid or cause collision? The rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", but it's a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> I think it means that from the current state, when I choose the action for this turn, I cannot choose the direction opposite to the current head direction, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> For example, if current direction is left, I cannot move right for this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if moving up, cannot move down, etc.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So for turn 9, head at (2,5), direction L, so I cannot move R (right).

When eating, length increases by one, so after eating, snake has three segments.\n> \n> Sequence: before move, snake: head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Move head to (2,4): if (2,4) has food, eat it, so new head at (2,4), and the tail does not move? No, when moving, the head moves to new cell, and if food eaten, the tail stays, so new segment added at tail position? Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Let's confirm the rules.\n> \n> \"Eating positive food: length of snake +1\"\n> \n> And movement: \"in each turn, move head one cell, body follows, tail moves away if no growth.\"\n> \n> But when food eaten, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added.\n> \n> So positions: start with [(2,5), (3,5)] length 2.\n> \n> Move head to (2,4): since (2,4) has food, eat it, so head now at (2,4), and the body segment remains at (2,5), tail at (3,5), but since growth, tail doesn't move, so new positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)] length 3.\n> \n> If no food, move to (2,4), head to (2,4), tail moves from (3,5), so new positions [(2,4), (2,5)]? When moving to empty cell: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, from [(2,5), (3,5)] move to (2,4): head to (2,4), then body segment that was at (2,5) is now the new position for the next segment, but there's only one body segment, which was at (3,5), it moves to where the head was, (2,5). So new positions: head (2,4), and body at (2,5). Since tail was at (3,5), and it moves to (2,5), so positions: [(2,4), (2,5)].\n> \n> But (3,5) is now empty.\n> \n> In this case, with growth, if eat at (2,4), positions become [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)].\n> \n> Back to turn 9.\n> \n> Only possible move is D to (2,4), and eat the food there.\n> \n> But is that safe? (2,4) has food, and I eat it.\n> \n> Now, the food at (2,4) has life span 5, so it will be there for a while, but I eat it now.\n> \n> Also, other food: (6,2) and (2,1) must be eaten this turn or lost, but they are far away, and I can't reach them this turn since only one move.\n> \n> From (2,5), I can only move to (2,4) this turn, as other moves are invalid.\n> \n> So for turn 9, I must move D to (2,4) and eat the food.\n> \n> Then snake becomes length 3: positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)] with head at (2,4), and since I moved down, new direction is D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for future turns.\n> \n> But the action sequence should start from turn 9.\n> \n> For turn 9, action is D.\n> \n> Then for turn 10, I need to choose next action.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their remaining life.\n> \n> At turn 9:\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 9, it disappears.

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,4), then body at (2,5), and tail at (3,5). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it was moving down last turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span means how many turns left before they disappear. For (2,1) and (5,1), life span is 1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 10, if not eaten, they vanish after turn 10.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L on turn T, it will be gone by turn T + L? Let's clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So on the turn it's spawned, life_span is N. After that turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears after that turn? The phrasing is a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn T, when we see life_span S, it means that after S more turns, it will disappear. Since countdown decreases on the current turn, after we process turn T, the life_span becomes S-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if the snake moves to the food cell on turn T, it eats it before the life span decreases, I assume.\n> \n> The key point is that for food with life span 1 on turn 10, if not eaten on turn 10, it will be gone by turn 11. So we have to eat it this turn or lose it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,1) and (5,1), life span 1, so they must be eaten on turn 10 or they disappear.\n> \n> (4,4) has life span 7, so it will last until turn 10+7=17, decreasing each turn.\n> \n> (5,3) has life span 10, until turn 20.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,4) moving down.

When snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the segment at (3,5) will move to the previous position of the segment before it, but since it's the tail, it depends.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: before move: head (2,4), body1 (2,5), body2/tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3):\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body1 moves to old head position: (2,4)\n> \n> - Body2/tail moves to old body1 position: (2,5)\n> \n> So new positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]?

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis and planning provided by the Thinking Model, the immediate action for the current Turn \\( t_0 = 11 \\) is to move **Right (R)** to eat the positive food at (4,4). This action aligns with the goal of maximizing the score while avoiding risks, as it allows the snake to safely consume the food and proceed towards the next food at (5,3) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 11 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(4, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 1), (2, 6), (1, 4), (5, 6), (4, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (5, 1, 1, 1)\n\t- (4, 4, 6, 1)\n\t- (5, 3, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 11 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8? Since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, that means 8 cells in each direction. Cells: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I'll note these as blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), and tail at (2,5). So, the snake has three segments: head at (3,4), body at (2,4), tail at (2,5). Head direction is R, which is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 1? The format is (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Let me check: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 1, 1, 1)\" so it's (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (4,4,6,1) and (5,3,9,1). So:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life_span 1, value +1 (since it says 1, and positive food is +1)\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life_span 6, value +1\n> \n> - Food at (5,3): life_span 9, value +1\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, which is the reward.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1), life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 11, if life span is 1, after this turn, it should disappear, meaning we can only eat it on turn 11 if we move there.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life_span L at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span N, decreases to N-1 at the end of turn t.\n> \n> - After turn t, if N-1 > 0, it remains.\n> \n> - It disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Standard: at the start of turn, if life span is S, it decreases by 1 at the end of the turn. If after decrease it becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: when food is spawned, it has life span N. On each turn, including the turn it was spawned, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For example, if at turn t, food has life span 1, then on turn t, it exists, and after turn t, it disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, if life span 2 at turn t, it exists on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life span 1 at turn 11. So it will disappear after turn 11, meaning we can eat it only on turn 11 if we move to (5,1) on turn 11.\n> \n> - Food at (4,4): life span 6, so it will last until turn 16 (since 11 + 6 - 1 = 16? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 11, life span 6. After turn 11, it decreases to 5, still there. After turn 12, to 4, and so on, until after turn 16, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 16.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 9, from turn 11 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction R, so last move was to the right to (3,4). From where? Snake positions: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]. So head at (3,4), previous head was at (2,4), and before that at (2,5)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> The positions are listed head first, so at some point, head was at (2,5), then moved to (2,4)? But direction is R, which is right, so from (2,4) to (3,4) was the last move, direction right.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,4), then body (2,4), then tail (2,5). So the snake segments: head (3,4), next segment (2,4), which is left of head, and then (2,5), which is below (2,4) or what?\n> \n> Grid: x increases right, y increases up? Typically in such games, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or? The movement: U (x,y+1) which is up, D (x,y-1) down, so y increases upwards, I assume. Similarly, L (x-1,y) left, R (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> So (3,4) is the head.\n> \n> (2,4) is left of head, same y.\n> \n> (2,5) is left and up from (2,4)? (2,4) to (2,5) is up, since y+1.\n> \n> So the snake: head at (3,4), body at (2,4), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> The last move was from (2,4) to (3,4) by moving right.\n> \n> Now, the head direction is R, meaning the current direction it is facing is right, so it just moved right to (3,4).\n> \n> For movement constraints: no instant reverse, so since it just moved right to (3,4), on the next turn, turn 11, it cannot move left (opposite to current direction). So possible moves: U, D, R. Cannot move L.\n> \n> Current head at (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (3,5)\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (3,3)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) = (4,4)\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) = (2,4) but (2,4) is occupied by the body, and also L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L anyway.\n> \n> Cannot move to a cell occupied by body except the tail, but (2,4) is body, not tail, tail is at (2,5). So moving to (2,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,5) is y=5, which is not 0 or 7, so ok? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=5 is fine. Similarly x=3 not 0 or 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: list (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So for possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: (3,5) – is it wall or obstacle? y=5, not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,5), (1,4), etc., but (3,5) not in list, so free? Need to check.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). None at (3,5), so (3,5) should be free.\n> \n> - D: (3,3) – not border, not in obstacles, free.\n> \n> - R: (4,4) – not border, but (4,4) has food? Food at (4,4) is present, but we need to see if we can move there.\n> \n> (4,4) is a cell, and it has food, but moving there would eat it if possible.\n> \n> But is (4,4) occupied? Snake body is at (2,4) and (2,5), head at (3,4), so (4,4) is empty except for food.\n> \n> Also, walls: no wall at (4,4), since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacles don't include (4,4).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2) – (4,2) is there, but (4,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, (4,4) has food with life span 6, value 1.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,1) with life span 1, so only available on turn 11.\n> \n> And (5,3) with life span 9.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,4), so to reach (5,1) which is at x=5,y=1, from (3,4), that's down and right, but y=1 is low, since y=0 is bottom wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n> \n> First, on turn 11, we need to choose an action.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R (since cannot L).\n> \n> If we move R to (4,4), that would eat the food there, since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (4,4), body segments: the current body (2,4) and (2,5) will move, but when snake eats food, it grows, so after moving, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (4,4), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, so body at (3,4), then (2,4), and tail (2,5) stays? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake moves to a new cell, if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. If not, tail moves forward.\n> \n> So here, if we move to (4,4) and eat food, then new snake positions: head at (4,4), then the previous positions: (3,4) becomes body, (2,4) becomes body, and (2,5) remains tail, so snake becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)] meaning head (3,4), segment 1 (2,4), segment 2 (2,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving right to (4,4) and eating: head moves to (4,4), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the body segments remain, but shifted: the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where? When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Specifically: new head at (4,4), then the first body segment was at (3,4), but (3,4) is now where the head was, so it becomes body at (3,4), then the next segment was at (2,4), it moves to where the first body was? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: body (2,4), index 2: tail (2,5)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (4,4). Since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: new head (4,4), new body at previous head position (3,4), then the body at (2,4) stays? No.\n> \n> The body segments: the segment that was at position 1 (2,4) should move to the previous position of segment 0, which was (3,4), but (3,4) is now occupied by the new body? It's messy.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake moves, all segments shift: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> But when food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So before move: segments: S0 = (3,4), S1 = (2,4), S2 = (2,5)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say P.\n> \n> If no food, S1 moves to S0 old position, S2 moves to S1 old position, so new segments: head at P, body at (3,4), tail at (2,4) — and S2 is gone.\n> \n> But if food eaten, S1 moves to S0 old, but S2 does not move, so new segments: head at P, body at (3,4), body at (2,4), and tail at (2,5) — so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if we move to (4,4) and eat food, new positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), body (2,4), tail (2,5). So snake has 4 segments.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, say move to (3,5), then new head (3,5), body at (3,4), and tail at (2,4) — since S1 moves to (3,4), and S2 moves to (2,4), but (2,5) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> Initial tail at (2,5), after move without eating, the tail moves to (2,4), so (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Back to turn 11.\n> \n> We need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, food at (5,1) has life span 1, so only available on turn 11. If we don't eat it now, it disappears.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at x=5,y=1. Head at (3,4). To reach (5,1) in one move? Not possible, since we can only move one step. From (3,4), to (5,1) requires multiple moves.\n> \n> Minimum moves: need to go right twice and down three times, but not necessarily in that order, but since one move per turn, it takes at least 5 moves to reach (5,1) from (3,4): Δx=2, Δy= -3, so min 5 moves if we go directly, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n> \n> But on turn 11, we can only move to adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,3), or (4,4).\n> \n> (5,1) is not adjacent, so we cannot eat it on turn 11. Since life span 1, it disappears after turn 11, so it's gone, we missed it. No point worrying about it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,4) is adjacent, we can eat it by moving R to (4,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is at (5,3), which is not adjacent, but we can reach it later.\n> \n> Now, life span of (4,4) is 6, so it will last until turn 16, as I thought earlier.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 9, until turn 19.\n> \n> But we need to survive and maximize score.\n> \n> Also, avoid risks, like collisions or dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7? No, borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so corners are included, but internal are separate.\n> \n> The state says: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell.\n> \n> Additionally, \"Internal Obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\" so these are also blocked.\n> \n> Now, (4,1): x=4,y=1, but y=1 is not border, since y=0 is border, y=1 is fine, but (4,1) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake at (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> Food at (4,4), (5,1) but (5,1) disappears after turn 11, so not available, and (5,3)\n> \n> (5,1) at turn 11, life span 1, so after turn 11, it's gone. Since we can't reach it on turn 11, it will disappear.\n> \n> So available food: (4,4) and (5,3)\n> \n> Now, on turn 11, actions:\n> \n> - Move U to (3,5)\n> \n> - Move D to (3,3)\n> \n> - Move R to (4,4)  -- which has food\n> \n> If we move R to (4,4), we eat the food, snake grows to length 4.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (4,4), body at (3,4), body at (2,4), tail at (2,5)\n> \n> Head direction: since we moved right, new direction R.\n> \n> Now, from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, what about moving U or D?\n> \n> If we move U to (3,5): what is there?

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,4) and (2,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or same y, differ by 1.\n> \n> Head (3,4) and tail (2,5): Δx=1, Δy=1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal, so no shared side, not adjacent.

It's turn 12. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (4,4) from (3,4)? Positions are given head first: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]. So from head to tail: (4,4) is head, then (3,4), then (2,4), then tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Since head direction is R, it was moving right to (4,4). So previous move was right.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (5,3) with life span 9 and value 1. Value 1 means it's positive food, since +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize. Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells. Also internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - Plus: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (1,4) is listed, and (1,2), (1,5) so x=1 has several walls.\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,4), body at (3,4), (2,4), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (5,3), life span 9, value +1.\n> \n> Current turn is t=12, so food disappears after 9 turns, meaning it will vanish at turn 12 + 9 = turn 21? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 12, life span is 9, so it has 9 turns left including turn 12. After turn 12, it will have 8 left, and so on, until turn 20 it has 1 left, then on turn 21 it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life_span is L, then after L turns, it's gone. Since countdown decreases each turn, including current, so at turn t, it has L turns left, including turn t. So after turn t+L-1, it should be gone, meaning on turn t+L, it's not there.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), and life_span is the remaining life at current turn.\n> \n> For food at (5,3), life_span=9 at turn 12. So it has 9 turns left, including turn 12. So it will be present from turn 12 to turn 20 (since 12 to 20 is 9 turns: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20). On turn 21, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 12: life=9, after turn 12, life=8 at turn 13, ..., at turn 20: life=1, after turn 20, life=0, so it disappears before turn 21. So food is available until turn 20 inclusive? Let's count:\n> \n> - Start turn 12: life=9\n> \n> - After turn 12: life=8 (for turn 13)\n> \n> - After turn 13: life=7 (for turn 14)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 19: life=1 (for turn 20)\n> \n> - After turn 20: life=0, so food gone on turn 21.\n> \n> So food can be eaten from turn 12 to turn 20.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is R, reverse would be L, so cannot move left immediately. So possible moves: U, D, R (since L is opposite).\n> \n> Movement: from (4,4), moving:\n> \n> - U: (4,5)\n> \n> - D: (4,3)\n> \n> - R: (5,4)\n> \n> - L: (3,4) but L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> Also, need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, check walls: (4,5) - is it a wall? Walls include (4,6), (4,1), (4,2), but (4,5) is not listed, and y=7 is wall, but (4,5) is y=5, x=4, not border or internal obstacle listed. Similarly, (4,3): not listed, (5,4): not listed.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (4,1), (4,2) — so (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are free? (4,4) has snake head, but for movement, we check if target cell is wall or body.\n> \n> Snake body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). So (4,5): not body, not wall, so free. (4,3): free. (5,4): free. (3,4) is body, but moving L to (3,4) is not possible because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,4): U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, food is at (5,3). So if I move R to (5,4), I'm not eating food yet. Food is at (5,3), so I need to get to (5,3) to eat it.\n> \n> But (5,3) is one cell down from (5,4), or one cell left from (4,3)? From (4,4), D to (4,3) gets me closer to (5,3), but not directly.\n> \n> Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,4)\n> \n> Food: (5,3)\n> \n> So (5,3) is one step right and one step down from head? From (4,4) to (5,3): delta x=+1, delta y=-1, so it's diagonal, not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells are only orthogonal, not diagonal, I think. Movement is only U/D/L/R, so to reach (5,3), I need to go to a cell that is adjacent to it.\n> \n> From (4,4), the adjacent cells are (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4). (5,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); it's diagonal. So I need at least two moves to reach it.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> - Move D to (4,3), then from there, (4,3) to (5,3) is R, so possible in two moves.\n> \n> - Move R to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (5,3) is D, so also possible.\n> \n> - Or U to (4,5), but that's away from food.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the path to food.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is positive, so I want to eat it, but need to avoid dangers.\n> \n> Now, the snake body: positions (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). Tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> If I move, the snake moves: head moves to new position, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (2,5), which might be a point to consider for Tail Reward Danger, but no food there now.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> List all wall cells to avoid.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So (1,4) is wall, for example.\n> \n> Now, let's find safe cells around.\n> \n> From head (4,4):\n> \n> - U: (4,5) - is it free? x=4,y=5. Not border, not in internal walls: internal walls have (4,6), (4,1), (4,2), not (4,5). And no snake body there. Body is at (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). (2,5) is tail, but (4,5) is free. So (4,5) is safe to move to.\n> \n> - D: (4,3) - similarly, not wall, not body. Body has (3,4) etc., not (4,3). Walls: (4,1) and (4,2) are walls, but (4,3) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> - R: (5,4) - not wall, not body. Walls: (5,6) is wall, but (5,4) not. Body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), not (5,4).\n> \n> So all three moves are safe for now.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food at (5,3), life span 9, so I have time, but since it's the only food, I should go for it, but carefully.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so it becomes longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> Current length 4.\n> \n> If I eat positive food, length becomes 5.\n> \n> But no other food mentioned, so only this one for now.\n> \n> The input has only one food: (5,3,9,1)\n> \n> So I need to get to (5,3) to eat it.\n> \n> Possible paths:\n> \n> Shortest path: from (4,4) to (5,3).\n> \n> Can go directly? Not adjacent, so min 2 moves.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,3) on turn 12, then from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) on turn 13 to eat it.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), on turn 13, head at (4,3), then move R to (5,3), which is food, so eat it, length increases to 5, and new tail is added, but since it's growth, the tail doesn't move when eating, I think.\n> \n> When you eat food, the snake grows, so the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail stays in place.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows, but since you eat, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to food cell, if it's food, it eats it, and snake grows, so the position that was tail remains, and new head position is food.\n> \n> But in terms of movement, when you move to food, you eat it.\n> \n> So in this sequence:\n> \n> Turn 12: move D to (4,3) — not food, so just move, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current positions: turn 12 start: snake [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n> \n> After move D: head to (4,3), then body: first segment to (4,4), but since head moved, body follows: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to where head was, (4,4)? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: before move: head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), tail (2,5)\n> \n> After move D to (4,3): new head is (4,3), then body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,4), second body segment moves to previous first body position (3,4), tail moves to previous second body position (2,4).\n> \n> The tail was at (2,5), and it moves to where the previous segment was? Let's index.\n> \n> Snake segments: index 0: head (4,4), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (2,4), index 3: tail (2,5)\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, say new_pos.\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to old pos of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old pos of segment 1, segment 3 moves to old pos of segment 2.\n> \n> So after move D to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was body) to (4,4)  // old head\n> \n> - Segment 2 to (3,4)  // old segment 1\n> \n> - Tail (segment 3) to (2,4)  // old segment 2\n> \n> Old segment 2 was (2,4), so tail moves to (2,4), and the old tail position (2,5) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, at (4,3), I can move on turn 13.\n> \n> Food at (5,3), which is adjacent to (4,3), since right: (5,3).\n> \n> So on turn 13, from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3), since it's food, snake grows: head moves to (5,3), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> Before move turn 13: positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), tail (2,4)  // from above\n> \n> After move R to (5,3): new head at (5,3), which is food, so eat it. Then, since food eaten, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added where the tail was, so positions: head (5,3), then body: segment 1 to old head (4,3), segment 2 to old segment 1 (4,4), segment 3 to old segment 2 (3,4), and new segment 4 (tail) at old tail position (2,4). So now snake is [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] length 5.\n> \n> Old tail was at (2,4), and it stays, new tail there.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (2,5) is empty now.\n> \n> But that's if I eat on turn 13.\n> \n> First, I need to get to (4,3) on turn 12.\n> \n> But on turn 12, if I move D to (4,3), is it safe?

Body after turn 12 move is at (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Also, after eating, positions as above.\n> \n> But I need to think beyond, for survival.\n> \n> Another option: move R on turn 12 to (5,4).\n> \n> Then from (5,4), on turn 13, I can move D to (5,3) to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, after move R turn 12: from (4,4) to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (3,4), tail to (2,4) — old segment 2 was (2,4), tail was (2,5) moves to (2,4).\n> \n> Before move: head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), tail (2,5)\n> \n> After move R to (5,4): new head (5,4), segment 1 to (4,4), segment 2 to (3,4), tail to (2,4). So tail moves to (2,4), and (2,5) empty.\n> \n> Then turn 13, from (5,4), move D to (5,3) to eat food. Head to (5,3), eat, grow: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), new tail at (2,4)? After move to (5,3): since food, head to (5,3), segment 1 to old head (5,4), segment 2 to old segment 1 (4,4), segment 3 to old segment 2 (3,4), and new segment 4 at old tail (2,4).

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? No, let's see: border cells are given, so walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4).

Another at (2,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive).\n> \n> Life span: for (5,3) it's 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns from now? The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 13, it will have 7 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. Similarly for (2,2), life span 10, so it will disappear after turn 22? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Current turn is 13. Food at (5,3) has life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 13 + 8 - 1? No. Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown = L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L-2, and so on, until countdown=0, and it disappears at the end of that turn or something.

It's turn 14, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the border cells, it seems like it's an 8x8 grid since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells in each direction.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0/x=7 means x=0 or x=7, similarly for y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)] – that's 8 points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). So the snake is 5 segments long, moving down. Head direction is D, which is down, so current movement is downward.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (2,2) with life span 9 and value 1. Since value is 1, it's positive food. Life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 turns, including the current turn, so it has 9 turns left starting from now? Let me read the rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Here, turn 14, food at (2,2) with life span 9, so it will disappear after turn 14 + 9 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown 0, disappears? Or after N turns means after N full turns?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it is present, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> But for planning, since we need to eat it before it disappears, we need to reach it when life span > 0.\n> \n> For simplicity, if life span is L at turn t, it can be eaten up to and including turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 14, life span 9, so it can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 22 (since 14 + 9 - 1 = 22? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 14: life span 9, present\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 8, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life span 1, present? After decrease at end of turn.\n> \n> I think the countdown decreases at the end of the turn. So at the beginning of turn t, life span is L, then during turn t, it is present, and at the end of turn t, L decreases by 1. When L=1 at start of turn, after decrease, L=0, it disappears for the next turn.\n> \n> So food with life span L at turn t can be eaten on any turn from t to t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> Here, turn 14, life span 9, so can be eaten from turn 14 to turn 22 (14 + 8 = 22? t to t + L - 1: 14 to 14+9-1 = 22).\n> \n> Turn 22: if eaten on turn 22, life span was 1 at start, decreases to 0 after.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), moving down.

It's turn 15, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the wall borders, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all these points to visualize.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,3) from previous position. Since head is at (4,3) and direction is L, it came from (5,3), which matches the body.\n> \n> Food: Only one food mentioned: (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. But in the input, it says (2,2,8,1), which I think is (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 15, it will disappear after turn 15 + 7 = 22? Let's calculate: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 15, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 15. So it will be gone after turn 22. After turn 15, life span becomes 7, then 6, etc., down to 0. When life span reaches 0, it disappears, I assume before the turn starts or something. Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N - 1 or turn t + N? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it will be present until the turn when countdown reaches 1, and after that turn, it's gone. For example, at turn 15, life span=8, so after turn 15, it becomes 7, and it will be gone after turn 22, meaning not present on turn 23. But for planning, since we're at turn 15, it has 8 turns left, including turn 15, so we have until turn 22 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction L. Possible moves: Since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn. Allowed moves: L (continue left), U (up), D (down).\n> \n> Now, the grid: I need to map out the grid to see where I can move.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> And snake occupies: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)\n> \n> Food at (2,2)\n> \n> I should sketch a grid.\n> \n> Let me make a 8x8 grid, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> y=7 top? Usually in grids, y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up? Typically in coordinates, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but in programming, sometimes y=0 top. But here, since U is (x,y+1), that might mean y increases upward, so (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right? Or not specified. But for movement, it doesn't matter, as long as consistent.\n> \n> In positions, snake is at (4,3), (5,3), etc., and food at (2,2). Walls at borders.\n> \n> I should list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked by walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)\n> \n> So occupied cells: walls, obstacles, snake body except tail might move.\n> \n> For collision, head cannot move to wall, obstacle, or body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if head moves to a cell that has a body segment except the current tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions this turn (turn 15): L, U, D.\n> \n> - If move L (left): to (3,3)\n> \n> - If move U (up): to (4,4)\n> \n> - If move D (down): to (4,2)\n> \n> But need to check if these are valid.\n> \n> First, (3,3): is it occupied? Walls: x=0 or x=7? 3 not 0 or 7. y=0 or 7? 3 not. Obstacles: look at list: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (3,3) not in list. Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (3,3) not occupied by snake. So (3,3) is free? But snake body has (3,4), not (3,3). So (3,3) should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,3) head, then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). So (4,4) is the fourth segment, not tail. Tail is (3,4). So (4,4) is a body segment, not tail. So if head moves to (4,4), it would collide with its own body.\n> \n> Confirm: if head moves to (4,4), which is currently occupied by a body segment, and it's not the tail, so yes, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): is it occupied? Walls: no. Obstacles: (4,2) is in the list! (4,2) is an internal obstacle. From the list: (4,2) is an obstacle. So cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (4,1) is obstacle, but (4,2) is separate.\n> \n> Obstacles include (4,2), so (4,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 15:\n> \n> - Move L to (3,3): possible, since empty.\n> \n> - Move U to (4,4): not possible, because occupied by body.\n> \n> - Move D to (4,2): not possible, obstacle.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,3). Is that right?\n> \n> Move U: to (4,4), which is occupied, so collision, death.\n> \n> Move D: to (4,2), obstacle, death.\n> \n> Move L: to (3,3), which seems free.\n> \n> But is (3,3) within bounds? x=3, y=3, between 0 and 7, yes.\n> \n> No wall or obstacle there.\n> \n> Snake body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (3,3) not in list.\n> \n> So yes, only possible move without dying is L to (3,3).\n> \n> But the rule says \"Cannot move opposite to current direction\", but L is same as current direction, so ok.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so L is allowed.\n> \n> U and D are perpendicular, allowed, but in this case, U and D lead to death, so only L is safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> I should list all cells.\n> \n> Grid:\n> \n> Rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> y=0: bottom?

(1,4) is in obstacles list. (2,4), (3,4) snake tail, (4,4) snake body, (5,4) snake body, (6,4), (7,4) wall.\n> \n> y=2: (0,2) wall, (1,2) obstacle, (2,2) food, (3,2), (4,2) obstacle, (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) wall.\n> \n> y=1: (0,1) wall, (1,1), but (4,1) obstacle? (4,1) obstacle, (1,1) not listed, so free? But y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 not border.\n> \n> (1,1): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, y=5: (0,5) wall, (1,5) obstacle, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) wall.\n> \n> y=6: (0,6) wall, (1,6)? (2,6) obstacle, (3,6), (4,6) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, (6,6), (7,6) wall.\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> Back to head at (4,3), move L to (3,3): (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake (snake has (3,4) but not (3,3)), so yes, free.\n> \n> Move U to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by snake body, segment before tail, so if head moves there, it would be on top of body, collision.\n> \n> Move D to (4,2): (4,2) is obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is L to (3,3).\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 15, I must move L.\n> \n> But the task is to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score, but here I have no choice, only one move.\n> \n> After moving, the snake will be: head moves to (3,3), then the body: the segment that was at (4,3) becomes new neck, but the tail moves away.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: new head at (3,3), then previous head (4,3) becomes next, then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), and tail (3,4) will be removed? When snake moves, if not eating, length same, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So from current: positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3), new positions: head (3,3), then the first body segment moves to (4,3), which was head position, then next to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (4,4). The tail (3,4) is left, so it disappears, and the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where? Let's index.\n> \n> Let S0 = head (4,3), S1 = (5,3), S2 = (5,4), S3 = (4,4), S4 = tail (3,4)\n> \n> After move left to (3,3): new head at (3,3). Then S0 is removed? No, S0 becomes the new position for S1? Better: the new head is (3,3). Then the segment that was S0 moves to where the head was, but head moved, so S0 is now the first body segment at (4,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard: the head moves to a new cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was head) moves to where? It becomes the neck at the position the head left, but since head was at (4,3), and it moves to (3,3), the cell (4,3) is now occupied by the first body segment? Let's think of positions.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head was at (4,3), moves to (3,3)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at (5,3) moves to (4,3) (previous head position)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (5,4) moves to (5,3) (previous position of S1)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (4,4) moves to (5,4) (previous position of S2)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,4) moves to (4,4) (previous position of S3)\n> \n> - And the tail was at (3,4), which moved to (4,4), so (3,4) is now empty.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> List: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, direction: since I moved L, new head direction is L.\n> \n> Now, food: only one food at (2,2), with value 1, life span 8 at turn 15, so it will last until turn 22? Life span 8 at turn 15, decreases each turn, so after turn 15, it becomes 7, then 6, ..., down to 0 at turn 22, so disappears after turn 22, meaning not present on turn 23. But we can eat it on turns 15 to 22 inclusive? At turn t, if life span L, it is present, and after turn, L decreases.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 15, L=8, present.

So after N turns, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span=N, then at turn t+1, life_span=N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, life_span=1, then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,2) at t=16, life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 22 (since 16+6=22, at turn 23 it's gone? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 16: life_span=7\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span=6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 23: life_span=0, so disappears before turn 23 or after turn 22? I think it disappears at the end of turn when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as head moves to food cell while it exists, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,6): life_span=10 at t=16, so lasts until turn 25 (16+9=25, life_span=1 at turn 25, disappears at turn 26).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for turns starting from t=16 onwards.\n> \n> Also, after each move, the snake moves, so positions change.\n> \n> Moreover, when food is eaten, the snake grows, so length increases.\n> \n> For positive food, eating it increases length by 1, so the tail doesn't move that turn, I assume? Standard Snake rules.\n> \n> In Snake, when you eat food, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail stays in place or something. But in terms of movement, when head moves to food, it eats, and the new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But in this case, for the next move, the tail has moved or not.\n> \n> Let me clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically, in Snake, each turn:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - If that cell has food, the snake eats it, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows.\n> \n> - If no food, the tail moves forward, so the snake shifts.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to new cell, and if food eaten, tail remains, else tail is removed from the end.\n> \n> In this state, snake positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] so head at (3,3), tail at (4,4).\n> \n> If head moves to a cell with food, say (2,2), then the new head is at (2,2), and the body includes the previous head and all segments, and tail stays, so positions become: [(2,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to new position, it becomes the new head. If food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows. If no food, the tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: current positions: head, body, tail.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head at new position.\n> \n> - If food eaten: new body is [old head, old body segments], so the tail segment remains, and a new segment is added effectively. So length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food: new body is [old head, all body segments except the tail is removed], so the tail moves away.\n> \n> In list terms: snake positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has food: new snake = [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  // length increases\n> \n> - If no food: new snake = [C, H, B1, B2, ...]  // the last element T is removed, so positions shift.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 5 segments: indices 0: head (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: tail (4,4)\n> \n> After move to new cell:\n> \n> - If eat food: new snake: [new_head, old_head, seg1, seg2, seg3, old_tail] so 6 segments.\n> \n> - If no food: [new_head, old_head, seg1, seg2, seg3] and seg3 was (5,4), tail (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> In no food case, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,3) at t=16.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L\n> \n> - L to (2,3)\n> \n> - U to (3,4)\n> \n> - D to (3,2)\n> \n> Now, (2,3) is empty, I think, no food or wall.\n> \n> Food is at (2,2) and (1,6), so (2,3) has no food.\n> \n> (3,4): let's see, is it occupied? Snake body: positions are (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). So (3,4) is not occupied, and not a wall. Food not there.\n> \n> (3,2): similarly, not occupied, not wall, no food.\n> \n> So all three moves are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is close, only one move away if I go down to (3,2), then next turn I can go left to (2,2)? From (3,2), to (2,2) is left, but let's see.\n> \n> Also, there is a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,4). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,3), tail at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (3,3) and (4,4) are diagonal, not adjacent in terms of up/down/left/right. Adjacent means sharing a side, so same x and y±1 or same y and x±1.\n> \n> So (3,3) and (4,4) differ in both x and y, so not adjacent. Only horizontal or vertical neighbors.\n> \n> So (3,3) neighbors: (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3) but (4,3) is body.\n> \n> Tail at (4,4), neighbors: (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4)\n> \n> (3,4) is a neighbor, but head is at (3,3), not at (3,4), so head is not adjacent to tail. So no danger from that.\n> \n> Now, let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> I should try to eat the food at (2,2) since it's closer and has shorter life.\n> \n> But I need to avoid obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (1,2) is an obstacle, and (2,2) is food, so (2,2) is not obstacle, but (1,2) is, which is adjacent.\n> \n> If I want to eat (2,2), from (3,3), I can go down to (3,2), then left to (2,2) on next turn.\n> \n> From (3,2) to (2,2) is left.\n> \n> Then I eat the food, snake grows.\n> \n> But after eating, I need to move away without colliding.\n> \n> Since I grow, the tail stays, so the cell (4,4) might be free or not, but I need to plan path.\n> \n> I could go left first to (2,3), then down to (2,2).\n> \n> From (3,3), L to (2,3), then from (2,3) D to (2,2).\n> \n> Both ways similar distance.\n> \n> Now, let's simulate.\n> \n> First, if I go down to (3,2) at turn 16.\n> \n> Action for t=16: D\n> \n> Then head moves to (3,2).

It's turn 17. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).

Head direction is Down, which is D, meaning it was moving down to (3,2) from (3,3)? Let's see: positions are given as [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. Since head is first, at turn 17, head is at (3,2), and it was at (3,3) before, so moving from (3,3) to (3,2) is down, since y decreases. Yes, direction D.\n> \n> Now, food: one at (2,2) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive), and another at (1,6) with life span 9 and value 1 (also positive). Both are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 17. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

No (3,1), so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, L: left to (2,2). (2,2) has food, but let's see if it's accessible. (2,2): not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed?

But food is at (2,2), so it's occupied by food, but we can move there to eat it, I think.\n> \n> Food positions are where food is, so cells with food can be moved to, and if head moves there, we eat it.\n> \n> But also, snake body: is (2,2) occupied? Snake is at (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), etc., no (2,2), so free except for food.\n> \n> R: right to (4,2). But (4,2) is an internal obstacle! From list: (4,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,2) is in internal obstacles.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U: (3,3) - occupied by body segment, collision, deadly.\n> \n> - D: (3,1) - seems free, no wall, no snake (yet)\n> \n> - L: (2,2) - has food, but free otherwise\n> \n> - R: (4,2) - obstacle, wall, cannot move\n> \n> So only possible moves are D or L. But I cannot move U because it's reverse and occupied, but U is opposite to current direction D? Current direction is D, so moving U would be reverse, which is not allowed instantly. But even if it were allowed, it's occupied, so impossible. So only D or L are possible.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,2) with life span 6. Since current turn is 17, it disappears after 6 turns, so on turn 17+6=23, it will disappear? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 17, life span 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including turn 17. After turn 17, life span becomes 5, then 4, ..., until 0, and disappears when life span reaches 0? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let me read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the time it's spawned, life_span N, then each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at (2,2) with life span 6 on turn 17, it means:\n> \n> - Turn 17: countdown=6\n> \n> - Turn 18: countdown=5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 23: countdown=0, disappears before or after? Probably, at the start of turn 23 or end? I think we need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, food is present until the turn it expires. So if life span is L on turn t, it exists on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears on turn t+L.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so on turn t + N, it is gone.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn including current\" suggests that on the turn it is present, countdown is reduced.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that with life span N at turn t, the food will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which could be ambiguous.\n> \n> Look at the input: for food, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), and current turn is t1.\n> \n> In this case, (2,2,6,1) at turn 17, so life_span=6.\n> \n> I think it's standard to interpret: food is available for exactly N turns, including the current turn. So from turn t to turn t + N - 1, it is present, and on turn t + N, it is removed.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on this turn.\n> \n> If N=2, available this turn and next, gone on the turn after next.\n> \n> In this case, life_span=6 at turn 17, so available from turn 17 to turn 17+5=22? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span=6, present\n> \n> - After turn 17, life_span decreases to 5\n> \n> - Turn 18: life_span=5, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life_span=1, present? After decrease, or before?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> It doesn't specify when it decreases relative to the turn.\n> \n> To simplify, I think for planning, we can assume that at the start of turn, the life span is as given, and after the snake moves, if it eats the food, it's consumed, else life span decreases by 1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", which might mean that during the turn, before action, it decreases, but that could be messy.\n> \n> I think for safety, with life_span L at turn t, the food will be gone by turn t + L.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,6) with life_span=9 at turn 17, it will last until turn 17+8=25 or something.\n> \n> But let's not overcomplicate; I'll assume that food at (2,2) can be eaten from turn 17 to turn 22 inclusive, since life_span 6 means 6 turns of availability starting from turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,6), life_span 9, available from turn 17 to 25.\n> \n> Now back to possible moves: from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,2), I eat the positive food, snake length increases by 1, so new positions: head at (2,2), then the body: since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] — length 6 now.\n> \n> Then head direction changes to L, since I moved left.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,1), then body: (3,2) becomes new segment, but since no food, tail (5,4) is removed, so new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] — tail (5,4) removed, so positions are head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). Length still 5.\n> \n> Head direction D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, there's a special rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (5,4), and head is at (3,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,2) and (5,4) are not adjacent; (3,2) to (4,2) would be, but (4,2) is wall, etc. Not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is not on tail; tail is (5,4), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the grid. I should sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is obstacle, as we saw.\n> \n> Snake: positions (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> Food: (2,2) and (1,6)\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, at turn 17, I have two choices: L or D.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,2), I eat food, grow to length 6. Then head at (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot reverse instantly; since I moved L, direction is L, so cannot move R next.\n> \n> Also, check surroundings:\n> \n> - U: (2,3) - is it free? Snake body: (3,2) is now body, but (2,3) not occupied. Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle at (1,2), (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - D: (2,1) - similarly, not border, obstacles: (4,1) is at (4,1), not (2,1), so free.\n> \n> - L: (1,2) - but (1,2) is an internal obstacle! From list, (1,2) is wall, so cannot move L.\n> \n> - R: (3,2) - but (3,2) is now occupied by the body segment after move, so collision, deadly.\n> \n> After moving to (2,2), snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (3,2) is the neck, so moving R to (3,2) is impossible, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (1,2) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> Moving U to (2,3): is it occupied? Snake has (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), not (2,3), so free? But walls: internal obstacles, (2,3) not listed, borders not, so yes free.\n> \n> Moving D to (2,1): similarly free.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) or D to (2,1), since L and R not possible.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), no food there, so snake moves, tail (5,4) removed, new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — and (5,3) becomes the end, since tail moved.\n> \n> After eating at (2,2), positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] length 6.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3), no food eaten, so head to (2,3), then body: (2,2) stays, but segments shift: new head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and tail (5,4) is removed, so positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] length still 6? No: when no food eaten, snake moves, so head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed. Since length increased to 6 after eating, but no new food, so when moving, the tail is removed, so length decreases? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. When you don't eat, the tail moves forward, so length stays the same.\n> \n> In this case: at turn 17, after moving to (2,2) and eating, snake length is 6.\n> \n> Then at turn 18, if I move to (2,3), no food there, so head moves to (2,3), and the tail (which was (5,4)) is removed, so the new positions are: head (2,3), then the previous head (2,2) becomes segment, then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and (5,4) is gone. So positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] length 6 still? (5,3) is included, but (5,4) was tail, now removed, and (5,3) was second last, now last.\n> \n> List: after eating at turn 17: positions: index 0:head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5:tail (5,4)\n> \n> At turn 18, move U to (2,3): new head at (2,3), then segment 0 moves to (2,2)? No: the body segments follow: the new body is the previous head position, so segment 1 becomes the new position for what was segment 0, etc.\n> \n> Standard: when moving, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for turn 18 move: head from (2,2) to (2,3), so new head at (2,3). Then, the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (2,2) — which is now the neck. Then segment at (3,3) moves to (3,2), segment at (4,3) moves to (3,3), segment at (5,3) moves to (4,3), and segment at (5,4) moves to (5,3). Since no food, the tail (5,4) is not there, but the segment that was at (5,4) moves to (5,3), and since no growth, the last position is vacated.\n> \n> Positions after move: head (2,3), then the body: the position that was head (2,2) is now occupied by the first body segment, so (2,2) is body. Then the next body segment was at (3,2), but now it moves to where the previous segment was? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake is a list of cells. When moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the cell of the previous segment, so the tail cell is freed.\n> \n> With eating, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, at start of turn 18, snake is at: S = [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n> \n> Move head to (2,3). Since (2,3) has no food, no growth, so new head at (2,3). Then, the segment that was at (2,2) becomes the new neck, so it stays at (2,2) but is now body. Then the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (2,2)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the first body segment (index 1) moves to the previous head position (2,2), so now at (2,2). The second body segment (index 2) moves to the previous position of index 1, which was (3,2), so to (3,2). Index 3 moves to previous position of index 2, which was (3,3), so to (3,3). Index 4 moves to previous position of index 3, which was (4,3), so to (4,3). Index 5 (tail) moves to previous position of index 4, which was (5,3), so to (5,3). And the previous tail position (5,4) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — length 6, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if from (2,2) I move D to (2,1), similar thing.\n> \n> But at (2,2), moving U or D.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 17 choice.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,2), I eat the food, but then from there, I can only go U or D, and the grid has obstacles, so I might be cornered.\n> \n> For example, from (2,2), if I go U to (2,3), then at (2,3), I can move where?

So from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2), but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so I can't move left because (1,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Head direction is L, but I need to choose an action for turn 18. The action can be U, D, L, R, but I have to consider movement constraints.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as L, meaning the snake was moving left to reach (2,2) from previous position. Since the positions are given with head first, and it was at (3,2) before moving to (2,2), so it moved left from (3,2) to (2,2).\n> \n> Now for turn 18, I need to choose a new direction: U, D, L, or R. But no instant reverse, so I cannot move right (R) because that would be opposite to current left direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): (x,y+1) = (2,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (2,1)\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (1,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (3,2)\n> \n> But:\n> \n> - Left to (1,2): (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> - Right to (3,2): (3,2) is the first body segment, the neck. But in snake games, moving into the neck might be possible if the tail moves, but I need to check collision rules.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail segment because the tail will move forward.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> After a move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving, the head should not collide with any body segment except that the tail is okay because it will move away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, wall collision: cannot move to wall cells.\n> \n> So from (2,2):\n> \n> - Move U to (2,3): is (2,3) occupied? Snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). (2,3) is not in this list, so not occupied by body. Is it a wall? Walls: borders, but (2,3) is not border, and internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (2,3) is not in internal obstacles, so it should be free. y=3, x=2, not in the list.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6). So (2,3) is clear.\n> \n> - Move D to (2,1): (2,1) not in snake positions, not border (since x=2>0, y=1>0), not internal obstacle (internal: (4,1) but not (2,1)), so free.\n> \n> - Move L to (1,2): (1,2) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - Move R to (3,2): (3,2) is the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, it would cause collision. Tail is (5,4), so (3,2) is the neck, not tail. Therefore, moving to (3,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,3) or D to (2,1). R is invalid due to collision, L is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food. Food is at (1,6) with value 1, life span 8. So I have until turn 25 to eat it, but since life span decreases each turn including current, it will disappear after 8 turns from now. Current turn 18, so it will be gone by turn 26? Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 18, life span 8, so after 8 turns, on turn 19, life span 7; turn 20, life span 6; ... turn 25, life span 1; turn 26, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 18 to turn 25 inclusive? When the head moves onto it on that turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need to get the head to (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is a cell, but let's see if it's accessible. (1,6) might be near obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), and also (2,6), etc.\n> \n> Specifically, (1,6): is it blocked? (1,6) is not listed as internal obstacle, and not border since x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) should be free, but there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6). (1,5) is obstacle, but (1,6) is different cell. So (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is obstacle, but (1,6) is separate.\n> \n> To reach (1,6) from current position (2,2), I need a path.\n> \n> Also, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, food is at (1,6), not on tail, so probably not an issue now.\n> \n> First, for turn 18, I have to choose between U or D.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), or D to (2,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple steps ahead to reach the food or other goals.\n> \n> Since there's only one food, I should try to eat it if possible, but safely.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so paths might be blocked later.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> List rows from y=7 top to y=0 bottom, or? Usually in coordinates, y increases up, but in grids, sometimes y=0 bottom. But for movement, it doesn't matter, I'll use coordinates as given.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right, but in the state, it's not specified, so I'll just use x and y.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles:\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> And borders are walls.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> Food at (1,6)\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) or D to (2,1)\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), then snake becomes: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) and tail (5,4) is removed since no food eaten.

Tail is (5,3). So moving to (3,3) would cause collision because after move, head is at (3,3), but that cell was previously occupied by a body segment, and since we moved, the body segment moves to the next, but at the moment of move, head enters a cell that was occupied, and if it's not the tail, it's collision.\n> \n> I think it's better to think in terms of the positions after move.\n> \n> After moving, the head should not be on a cell that is occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail if it moves.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the cell that was tail is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Therefore, if you move the head to the current tail position, it's ok because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But if you move to any other body segment position, that segment is still there until it moves, but since all segments move simultaneously, the head would be on a cell that is still occupied for that instant, causing collision.\n> \n> So, generally, moving to a cell occupied by any body part except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Moving to the tail is safe only if no food is eaten, because if you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for movement, to avoid collision, we can move to the tail cell only if we don't eat food there, or something.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> From movement constraints: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" This implies that moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But if there is food on the tail cell and you eat it, then the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on the same cell after growth, which is collision.\n> \n> In this state, the tail is at (5,3), and there is no food there, so moving to tail is safe if possible.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - U to (2,4): is this free?

Snake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (2,4) is not occupied by snake. So moving U to (2,4) should be safe.\n> \n> - L to (1,3): (1,3) is not border, not in internal obstacles?

After turn 19: positions [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> So (4,3) is tail.\n> \n> The area around is relatively open except for obstacles.\n> \n> Food (1,6) at (1,6): to reach it, I need to go left and up, but (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so I cannot go directly to (1,6) from below or left; only from right or down, but (1,6) has neighbors: (1,7) wall, (0,6) wall, (1,5) obstacle, (2,6) obstacle. So (1,6) is surrounded by walls and obstacles except possibly (2,6) but (2,6) is obstacle, and (1,5) obstacle, so (1,6) has no adjacent free cells? That can't be.\n> \n> (1,6): adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) y=7 wall\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) internal obstacle\n> \n> - Left: (0,6) x=0 wall\n> \n> - Right: (2,6) internal obstacle\n> \n> All adjacent cells are blocked! So (1,6) is isolated; there is no way to reach it because all sides are walls or obstacles. But the food is there, so how can it be eaten?\n> \n> Perhaps I misremember the coordinates.\n> \n> Food is at (1,6), value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> But (1,6): x=1, y=6.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (1,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so cell (1,7) is wall.\n> \n> - South: (1,5) - internal obstacle, given (1,5) is obstacle.\n> \n> - West: (0,6) - x=0 border wall.\n> \n> - East: (2,6) - internal obstacle, given (2,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> So indeed, all four adjacent cells are blocked, so no snake can ever move to (1,6) because there's no access. That means this food is impossible to eat. It might be a mistake, or perhaps it can be eaten if the snake is already on it, but it spawned under the body? But the rule says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 19, snake positions do not include (1,6), so it's not under snake. But since no adjacent cells are free, it's inaccessible. So probably, this food cannot be eaten at all. It will just disappear after life span.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is accessible.\n> \n> (3,5) adjacent: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (3,6): not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), not (3,6), so (3,6) is free.\n> \n> (3,4) free.\n> \n> (2,5): not obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed as obstacle, and not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> (4,5) free.\n> \n> So (3,5) has multiple access points.\n> \n> Therefore, (1,6) is unreachable, so I should ignore it.

Let's clarify the life-span rule.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

No, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, but since the tail moves only if no eating, it's confusing.\n> \n> I think I have it:\n> \n> - When no food: tail moves, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> - When food eaten: tail does not move, so the cell remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> Before: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]  k+2 segments for length L.\n> \n> After move to empty cell: new head at new_pos, then [new_pos, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk]  T is removed, so positions [new_pos, H, B1, ..., Bk]  length same.\n> \n> After move to food: new head at food_pos, then [food_pos, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]  because we add a new segment at T, so T is no longer tail, it becomes body, and the new segment is at T position? No.\n> \n> Standard way: when eating, the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail is now the new segment.\n> \n> For example: positions before: A (head), B, C (tail)\n> \n> Move to food F: new head F, then A becomes body, B becomes body, C remains, and a new segment is added at C, so new positions: [F, A, B, C] and C is now the second last, new tail at C? No.\n> \n> [F, A, B, C] with C as tail, but C was tail before, so it's like the tail didn't move, and we added a segment before it.\n> \n> Positions: from [A,B,C] to [F,A,B,C] when eating, so C is still there, but now it's the tail, and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> In this case, for our snake: before: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]  so head (3,4), body segments (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (3,3)\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) and eating: new positions: head (3,5), then old head (3,4) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and tail (3,3) remains, and since eating, we add a new segment at the position of the old tail, which is (3,3), so new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]  so the tail is now (3,3), and (3,2) is body.\n> \n> The new segment is added at the old tail position, so the old tail position has a new segment, and the tail is that new segment.\n> \n> But in terms of the cell, (3,3) was occupied, and it remains occupied.\n> \n> For collision: after move, if head hits any body segment except the tail it's moving from, it's collision. But since tail moves when no eating, or stays when eating, it's safe to move to tail position only if no eating, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,5), which has food, I eat it, so tail does not move, so (3,3) remains occupied, and head is at (3,5), which is not the tail, so no problem.\n> \n> Now, is (3,5) occupied by body? Before move, snake positions are (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), so (3,5) is not occupied, it has food, so moving there is fine.\n> \n> But let's check for Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,3), head is at (3,4), so they are adjacent vertically? (3,4) and (3,3) are adjacent, yes, since same x, y differs by 1.\n> \n> And if I eat food at the tail cell? But the food is at (3,5), not at tail cell.\n> \n> The tail cell is (3,3), which has no food.\n> \n> So for moving to (3,5), there is no tail reward danger because the food is not on the tail cell.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if I eat food that is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Here, food is at (3,5), tail at (3,3), not the same.\n> \n> So moving U to (3,5) should be safe.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so it might be harder to move later.\n> \n> Other moves: D to (3,3) – (3,3) is the tail! So moving down to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, (3,3) is currently occupied by the tail. But since it's the tail, and if I don't eat food, the tail will move away, so it's safe to move there.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,3), what happens? (3,3) is the tail, so after move, head moves to (3,3), which was tail, but tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, which is (3,2).\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n> \n> After moving down to (3,3): new head at (3,3), then old head (3,4) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) becomes the new tail?

No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y. But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid? x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.

In grid terms, usually y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up. Similarly, D is (x,y-1), down.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (3,5) with direction U, so it's moving up to (3,6)? But y=6 might be wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Playable y: 1 to 6.\n> \n> So (3,5) moving U would be to (3,6).\n> \n> But is (3,6) occupied?

Life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn 22, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 25? Let's see: turn 22, life span 4, so it exists for 4 more turns: turns 22,23,24,25. After turn 25, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 25.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 10, so exists until turn 31? Turn 22 + 10 - 1 = turn 31? Countdown: at turn t, life span N, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. So if life span N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span N, then after this turn (turn t), the countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (1,6), life span 4 at turn 22. After turn 22, countdown 3; after turn 23, countdown 2; after turn 24, countdown 1; after turn 25, countdown 0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 22 to 25 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 10 at turn 22: after turn 22, 9; ... after turn 31, 0, disappears. Can be eaten turns 22 to 31.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly.

Body positions: (3,5), (3,4), etc., (3,6) not there. So safe to move.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5. Is it obstacle? Obstacles include (1,5), but not (2,5). (2,5) not in obstacle list. Not wall. Snake body: head is (3,5), body (3,4), (2,4), etc. (2,5) not occupied. So safe.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4,y=5. Obstacles? (4,1),(4,2),(4,6) but not (4,5). So not obstacle. Not wall. Snake: not occupied.

It's turn 23. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). That's a lot of obstacles; I need to be careful.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right last turn.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - At (1,6) with value 1 and life span 3. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 23, it has 3 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 25 (since turn 23, 24, 25, gone on turn 26? Life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it has L turns including this one. So for (1,6), life span 3 at turn 23, so it can be eaten on turn 23, 24, or 25; gone on turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) has value 1 and life span 9, so it has many turns left.\n> \n> Both foods have positive value +1, since value is 1 for both. Negative food would have value -1, but here both are 1, so both positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 23.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5)\n> \n> Head direction: R, so last move was right. That means I cannot move left instantly, because no instant reverse. So possible moves from (4,5): up (U), down (D), right (R), but not left (L) because that would be opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is R, so from (4,5), moving right would be to (5,5), but let's see what's there.\n> \n> (5,5) has food with value 1, but also, let's check if moving there is safe.\n> \n> First, list possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U: (4,6)\n> \n> - D: (4,4)\n> \n> - R: (5,5)\n> \n> - L: (3,5) but that's the body, and also, since current direction is R, moving L is reverse, so not allowed.\n> \n> Cannot move left because it's opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Now, check each for collisions:\n> \n> - U to (4,6): is there a wall or obstacle? Walls: border y=7, but (4,6) is y=6, which is not border. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,6) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is listed! (4,6) is an internal obstacle. So (4,6) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): is this a wall? x=4, y=4. Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,4) is fine. Obstacles: (4,1), (4,2) are obstacles, but (4,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake body: snake positions are (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). (4,4) is not in snake positions, so it should be empty. So moving down to (4,4) seems possible.\n> \n> - R to (5,5): (5,5) has food, but is it safe? First, check walls: x=5,y=5, not border. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (5,6), but not (5,5). (5,5) not listed in obstacles, so free. But snake body: (5,5) not in snake positions, so empty. Also, (5,5) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: borders x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so 8x8 grid? x=0 to 7 inclusive, that's 8 cells.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, yes.\n> \n> Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So the snake is like: head at (4,5), body to left (3,5), then down to (3,4), then left to (2,4), down to (2,3), down to (2,2), then right to (3,2). So it's a bit coiled.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) and (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is directly to the right of head (4,5), so moving right would go to (5,5) and eat the food.\n> \n> But is there any danger?\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (3,2), but when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Now, for (1,6), it has only 3 turns left, including turn 23, so I need to eat it by turn 25.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) has many turns, but it's close.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 23.\n> \n> From (4,5), I can move:\n> \n> - D to (4,4)\n> \n> - R to (5,5)\n> \n> U to (4,6) is blocked by obstacle, L to (3,5) is body and also reverse direction not allowed.\n> \n> So only two choices: down or right.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,5), I eat the food, snake grows to 8 segments, and head moves to (5,5). Then the new positions: head at (5,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and so on. Tail remains until next move.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; the segment is added.\n> \n> Then next turn, when I move, the tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, when I move to (5,5), it was empty, so no collision.\n> \n> But is (5,5) safe to move to? Yes, as per above.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (5,5), head is at (5,5), direction now R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Then for turn 24, from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction is R, so I cannot move left (opposite).\n> \n> U to (5,6): is (5,6) free? Internal obstacle: (5,6) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (5,4): should be free? Walls: no. Obstacles: not listed. Snake: not occupied yet.\n> \n> R to (6,5): should be free? x=6,y=5, not border, no obstacle listed.\n> \n> L to (4,5): but (4,5) is now body? After moving to (5,5), the snake positions are: head (5,5), then (4,5) (previous head), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So (4,5) is body, so moving left to (4,5) would collide with body. Also, since current direction is R, moving L is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (5,5), possible moves: U is blocked, D to (5,4), R to (6,5), L not allowed.\n> \n> So down or right.\n> \n> If I go down to (5,4), or right to (6,5).\n> \n> (5,4) might be safe, (6,5) also.\n> \n> But I need to consider the other food at (1,6) which is time-sensitive.\n> \n> (1,6) has only 3 turns life, so if not eaten by turn 25, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 23: if I don't eat it now, it has life 3 at turn 23, so after turn 23, if not eaten, life span decreases to 2 at turn 24, etc.\n> \n> At turn 23, I can eat it if I move to (1,6), but it's far.\n> \n> From (4,5), to reach (1,6), I need to go left and up, but (1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n> \n> But there are obstacles around.\n> \n> For example, (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, so (1,6) might be accessible only from certain directions.\n> \n> (1,6): y=6, x=1.\n> \n> Possible to move to (1,6) from (1,5) or (1,7) or (0,6) or (2,6).\n> \n> But (1,5) is obstacle, (1,4) obstacle, (2,6) obstacle, and (0,6) is border, x=0 wall, so (1,6) is surrounded? Let's see adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) - y=7 is border wall, so blocked.\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) - internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - Left: (0,6) - x=0 border, blocked.\n> \n> - Right: (2,6) - internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> (2,6) is obstacle, yes.\n> \n> So (1,6) has all four adjacent cells blocked? That can't be right because if all adjacent are blocked, how can I eat it? But the food is there, so I must be able to access it.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move to (1,6) directly if the head is adjacent and moves there.\n> \n> But to be adjacent, I need to be on a neighboring cell.\n> \n> But all neighbors are walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (1,6): neighbors:\n> \n> - North: (1,7) - y=7, border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - South: (1,5) - internal obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - West: (0,6) - x=0, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - East: (2,6) - internal obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> So all adjacent cells are blocked, meaning I cannot move to (1,6) because there's no way to access it; it's completely surrounded by walls and obstacles.\n> \n> But that seems odd. Perhaps I misread the obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> So for (1,6):\n> \n> - (1,5) is obstacle to the south.\n> \n> - (2,6) is obstacle to the east.\n> \n> - (1,7) is border wall north.\n> \n> - (0,6) border wall west.\n> \n> Yes, all adjacent cells are blocked, so (1,6) is inaccessible. I cannot reach it to eat the food.\n> \n> Is that possible? But the food is placed there, so maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps I can still eat it if the snake is already on it, but the head isn't on it now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n> \n> But here, (1,6) is not under snake; snake is elsewhere.\n> \n> Snake is at (4,5) etc., not near (1,6).\n> \n> So (1,6) has no free adjacent cells, so I cannot move to it. It's impossible to eat that food.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore it since it's inaccessible.\n> \n> Life span doesn't matter if I can't reach it.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (5,5) is accessible and close.\n> \n> So for turn 23, I should consider moving to (5,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But let's confirm if (1,6) is really inaccessible.\n> \n> Grid: y=6, x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (1,6): x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Adjacent:\n> \n> - (1,7): y=7, border, wall.\n> \n> - (1,5): internal obstacle.\n> \n> - (0,6): x=0, border wall.\n> \n> - (2,6): internal obstacle.\n> \n> Yes, all blocked. So indeed, (1,6) cannot be accessed; it's trapped. So I can forget about that food; it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> Therefore, only (5,5) is the available food.\n> \n> Now, for turn 23, I have two choices: move down to (4,4) or right to (5,5).\n> \n> If I move right to (5,5), I eat the food, snake grows.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,4), I don't eat, and (5,5) is still there.\n> \n> But (5,5) has life span 9, so it will be there for many turns.\n> \n> However, moving down might be safer or allow for better positioning.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,2), head at (4,5), not adjacent. Distance is large.\n> \n> (3,2) to (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y difference 1.\n> \n> Delta x=1, delta y=3, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's plan for 5 turns.\n> \n> First, option 1: move right to (5,5) on turn 23.\n> \n> Then snake positions after turn 23:\n> \n> Head at (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] length 8.\n> \n> Head direction now R.\n> \n> Now turn 24: from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) — but (5,6) obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> D to (5,4) — should be free.\n> \n> R to (6,5) — should be free.\n> \n> L to (4,5) — body and reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So down or right.\n> \n> If I go down to (5,4), no food, so snake moves, tail moves to the next, so positions: head to (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) — tail was (3,2), but since no eat, tail moves, so (3,2) is removed, new tail is (2,2)? Positions: after moving head to (5,4), body segments follow: previous head (5,5) becomes neck, then (4,5), etc. down to (2,3), and (2,2) was last, but (2,2) moves to where? When head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So after turn 23: segments: S0: (5,5), S1: (4,5), S2: (3,5), S3: (3,4), S4: (2,4), S5: (2,3), S6: (2,2), S7: (3,2) — index from head.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4) on turn 24, no eat: head to (5,4), then S1 to previous S0 position (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was head becomes part of body, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: before move: [H: (5,5), B1: (4,5), B2: (3,5), B3: (3,4), B4: (2,4), B5: (2,3), B6: (2,2), B7: (3,2)] 8 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4): new head (5,4), then new B1 is old H position (5,5), new B2 is old B1 (4,5), new B3 is old B2 (3,5), new B4 is old B3 (3,4), new B5 is old B4 (2,4), new B6 is old B5 (2,3), new B7 is old B6 (2,2).

It's turn 24, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. But let's list the internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> So all these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 8 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 2. That means it will disappear after 2 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 24, life span is 2, so after turn 24, it decreases to 1, and after turn 25, it decreases to 0 and disappears.

Snake positions: head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2).

With no other food available, the priority shifts to long-term survival by moving downward to open areas with fewer obstacles, avoiding potential traps near the right edge or body collisions. The sequence ensures safe movement for at least 5 turns by descending to the bottom row and then turning right to maintain maneuverability.\n",

It's turn 25. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is D, meaning down, so it's moving downward.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 10, life span 1\n> \n> Life span 1 means they disappear after this turn, including the current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 1, it will disappear after turn 25 if not eaten. The description says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span L, it will be available for L turns, including the turn it's spawned. If L=1, it can be eaten only on turn t if the head moves there on turn t.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 1, so it must be eaten on turn 25 or it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): life span 10, but since it's turn 25, it will disappear after 10 turns, so on turn 35 if not eaten. But life span 10 means it has 10 turns left, starting from now.\n> \n> Current turn is 25. Food at (5,4) has life span 10, so it will disappear after turn 25 + 10 - 1? Let's clarify the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think \"after N turns\" means it exists for N turns, so if spawned on turn T, it disappears at the end of turn T + N - 1 or something. But here, it's given with current life span.\n> \n> For example, at turn 25, food at (1,6) has life span 1, meaning it can be eaten only on turn 25; if not eaten, it disappears after turn 25.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) has life span 10, so it can be eaten from turn 25 to turn 34, and disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, look at the snake head position: (5,4). There is food at (5,4) with value 10. But the snake head is already on (5,4)? Snake positions: head at (5,4), and food at (5,4). But according to the rules, food can be under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Here, the head is on (5,4), and food is also at (5,4), but since the head is already there, can it eat the food immediately? The rule says the head must move onto the food cell, but it's already on it? That might be a special case.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Since the head is already on the food, and the body is also on some cells, but for the head position, if food is under the head, and the head doesn't move, can it eat? But in this case, the head will move away if we choose a direction.\n> \n> I think when the snake moves, if the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it. But here, the head is currently on a food cell, but since it's the starting position, it might not have been eaten yet because the food spawned under it.\n> \n> The rule specifies that for food under the body, it must be that the body moves away first, meaning that in the next turn, if the snake moves and the body leaves that cell, and then the head moves back, it can eat.\n> \n> But for the head cell, if food is under the head, and the head stays, does it eat? The rule doesn't explicitly say, but from the condition, it implies that eating only happens when the head moves onto the cell, not when it's already on it.\n> \n> Moreover, in the state, the snake head is at (5,4) and food is at (5,4), so probably the food is under the head, but not eaten yet because the head didn't move onto it; it was already there.\n> \n> So, to eat the food at (5,4), we need to move the head away so that the body moves away from (5,4), and then move the head back to (5,4) to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for other body cells.\n> \n> Now, in this case, the head is at (5,4), so if we move the head to another cell, say (5,3) down or something, then (5,4) might be occupied by the next body segment, but when we move, the whole snake moves.\n> \n> Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). Direction down.\n> \n> If we move down, head goes to (5,3), then the body: the segment at (5,5) moves to (5,4), (4,5) moves to (5,5)? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves down to (5,3), then:\n> \n> - New head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (5,5)) moves to (5,4)  // position of old head\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (4,5)) moves to (5,5)  // position of old segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (3,5)) moves to (4,5)  // position of old segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (3,4)) moves to (3,5)  // position of old segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (2,4)) moves to (3,4)  // position of old segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (2,3)) moves to (2,4)  // position of old segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (2,2)) moves to (2,3)  // position of old segment 6\n> \n> And the tail, segment 7, was at (2,2), moves to (2,3), so (2,2) is now empty.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,4): currently, head is at (5,4), but after moving down, the head moves to (5,3), and the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (5,4). So (5,4) is now occupied by the body, specifically the segment that was behind the head.\n> \n> So the food at (5,4) is still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> To eat the food at (5,4), we need to move so that at some point, (5,4) is empty, and then we move the head back to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,6), it has life span 1, so it must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> But to eat (1,6), we need to move to (1,6) this turn.\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), (1,6) is at x=1,y=6. Distance is |5-1| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6, too far to reach in one turn. So impossible to eat (1,6) this turn. Therefore, (1,6) will disappear after this turn since life span 1.\n> \n> Life span 1, current turn 25, so if not eaten on turn 25, it disappears. Since head is at (5,4) and (1,6) is 4 units away in x and 2 in y, min moves is 6, so can't reach in one move. Thus, (1,6) cannot be eaten and will disappear.\n> \n> So we can ignore (1,6).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,4) with value 10, life span 10. It can be eaten later, but we need to free the cell first.\n> \n> Also, there is a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,2). Head is at (5,4), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,4) to (2,2) is not adjacent; distance |5-2| + |4-2| = 3+2=5, not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position: head at (5,4), direction down, so we can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is D (down), we cannot move U (up) on the next turn, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> So allowed moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). Not U.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (5,4):\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) - is this valid? y=3, between 0 and 7, but check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: list is (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in obstacles, so should be free, but we need to check if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in this list, so it should be empty, except possibly food, but no food at (5,3), only at (5,4) and (1,6).\n> \n> So (5,3) is empty and safe to move to.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) - x=4,y=4\n> \n> Check bounds: x=4 between 0 and 7, y=4 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2) — (4,4) not there.\n> \n> Snake positions: not in list, so empty.\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) - x=6,y=4\n> \n> Bounds: x=6, y=4, borders x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for (6,4): x=6, which is not 0 or 7? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not border, but x=7 is wall, so (6,4) has x=6 <7, so not border wall. Similarly, y=4 not 0 or 7. So (6,4) is within free area.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: none at (6,4), snake not there, so empty.\n> \n> Now, moving down to (5,3): as I thought earlier.\n> \n> But if we move down, head to (5,3), body moves, so (5,4) is now occupied by the first body segment (was at (5,5)).\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is still under that body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move left to (4,4), head to (4,4), then body: segment from (5,5) moves to (5,4), etc., so (5,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at (5,5), so food still under body.\n> \n> If we move right to (6,4), similar, (5,4) occupied by the body segment that was behind head.\n> \n> In all cases, when we move, the cell (5,4) is immediately occupied by the next body segment, so the food remains under the body.\n> \n> To free (5,4), we need to move in such a way that after some moves, the body leaves (5,4) empty.\n> \n> For example, if we move down, to (5,3), then positions: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> (5,4) is occupied.\n> \n> If we move left to (4,4), head (4,4), body: (5,4) (from old head), (5,5) (from old body), etc. So (5,4) is occupied by the segment that was at (5,5)?

moment, if we move head there, we can eat the food.\n> \n> Let's see.\n> \n> From state after turn 25 move down: head at (5,3), pos1 at (5,4)\n> \n> Food at (5,4) under pos1.\n> \n> If on turn 26, we move left to (4,3), for example.\n> \n> Then head to (4,3), pos1 to (5,3)  // old head position, so pos1 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> Then pos2 to (5,4)  // old pos1 position\n> \n> So when pos1 moves from (5,4) to (5,3), the cell (5,4) is vacated, but immediately occupied by pos2 moving to it, so it's not empty; it's occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> Only when the segment on it is the tail and it moves, the cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, the segment on (5,4) is not the tail; it's the first body segment.\n> \n> So when it moves, the next segment moves in, so the cell is never empty until the tail leaves it.\n> \n> For a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, when that segment moves, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment if the snake is straight.\n> \n> If the snake turns, it might be empty.\n> \n> For example, suppose from head at (5,3), pos1 at (5,4), if we move right to (6,3).\n> \n> Then head to (6,3), pos1 to (5,3), so pos1 moves to (5,3), which was head.\n> \n> Then pos2 to (5,4), so (5,4) is occupied by pos2.\n> \n> Cell (5,4) was vacated by pos1, but pos2 moves in immediately.\n> \n> No gap.\n> \n> But if the snake turns sharply, there might be a gap.\n> \n> For example, suppose from head at (5,3), pos1 at (5,4), if we move up to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by pos1, so collision, death.\n> \n> Cannot move there.\n> \n> Or if we move to a cell that is not the next, but we can only move to adjacent.\n> \n> So it seems impossible to have a gap; the body segments are always connected, so when one moves, the next moves to its position, so no cell is empty except the new head position and the old tail position when tail moves.\n> \n> The only cells that become empty are the old tail position when the tail moves, and the new head position if it was empty.\n> \n> For a body cell, it is always occupied until the tail passes.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is currently head, after move, it becomes body, and it will be occupied for the next 7 turns until the current tail moves 7 times, and the segment that was on (5,4) becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> But when it moves away, the cell is free.\n> \n> Let's calculate.\n> \n> Initial: head at (5,4), tail at (2,2)\n> \n> After move, say down, head to (5,3), the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (5,4), so now (5,4) occupied by this segment, which is the new pos1.\n> \n> This segment will remain on some cell until it becomes the tail.\n> \n> The current tail is at (2,2), and there are 7 segments behind the head, so this pos1 segment will be the tail after 7 moves.\n> \n> After 7 moves, this segment will be at the tail position and when it moves, the cell it was on will be free.\n> \n> For example, after 7 moves, the segment that is now pos1 will be the tail, and when it moves on the 8th move, the cell it was on will be free.\n> \n> But that cell may not be (5,4); it depends on the path.\n> \n> If we move in a straight line, the cell (5,4) will be occupied for 7 turns, then on the 8th turn, when the tail moves, it is free.\n> \n> But the food life span is 10, so it's ok, but we need to be there to eat it.\n> \n> But after 7 turns, the head is far away, so we may not be able to move back.\n> \n> So it's better to move in a circle to stay near.\n> \n> For example, move in a small loop around (5,4).\n> \n> But with obstacles, it might be hard.\n> \n> Look at the obstacles near (5,4): (4,6), (5,6), (4,2), etc., not directly blocking.\n> \n> For example, from (5,4), move down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), but (4,4) might be free, then right to (5,4).\n> \n> But from (4,3), if we move up to (4,4), is (4,4) free?\n> \n> After moving down to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> (4,4)

Let's think about the path.\n> \n> The head is at position 0: (5,3). The next segment, position 1: (5,4), which is (x, y+1) from head? (5,3) to (5,4) is +y, so if head moved to (5,3) from previous, it came from above, so it moved down to (5,3). Yes, that makes sense with direction D. So current head position is (5,3), and it arrived there by moving down from (5,4), so direction is down. If it continues down, it would go to (5,2).\n> \n> Similarly, if it moves up, to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by the body, so it would collide if it moves there immediately.\n> \n> But in the rules, it can move into the tail position because the tail moves, but here (5,4) is not the tail; it's the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's list all positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) head\n> \n> - (5,4) body segment 1\n> \n> - (5,5) body segment 2\n> \n> - (4,5) body segment 3\n> \n> - (3,5) body segment 4\n> \n> - (3,4) body segment 5\n> \n> - (2,4) body segment 6\n> \n> - (2,3) tail segment 7\n> \n> So the tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions: only one food is given: (5,4, 10, 1) which I think is (x,y, life_span, value). Let's read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> So (x,y) = (5,4), life_span=10, value=1. Value=1 is positive food, since +1 reward.\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied by the snake's body segment 1. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, food is at (5,4), which is where body segment 1 is.\n> \n> Life span is 10, meaning it disappears after 10 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 26, so food will disappear after turn 26 + 10 - 1? Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 26, life_span=10, so it will be there for turns 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35, and disappear after turn 35, meaning not available on turn 36? Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> But it says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span=N, then on turn t, countdown=N, on turn t+1, countdown=N-1, ..., on turn t + (N-1), countdown=1, on turn t + N, it disappears, so it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For this food at turn 26, life_span=10, so it exists from turn 26 to turn 35 inclusive? Countdown: turn 26: 10, turn 27:9, ..., turn 35:1, turn 36: gone. So it can be eaten from turn 26 to 35.\n> \n> But currently at turn 26, the food is at (5,4), which is occupied by the snake body. So to eat it, the snake needs to move away from that cell and then back when it's free.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,3), direction down. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so instant reverse would be U (up), which is to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Other moves: D (down) to (5,2), L (left) to (4,3), R (right) to (6,3).\n> \n> But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

It's turn 27. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7.

So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (4,3) from previous position. Since head is at (4,3) and direction is L, it came from (5,3) which is the first body segment.\n> \n> Food: only one piece given: (5,4) with value 1 and life span 9. But (5,4) is also a body segment of the snake. Specifically, it's the third segment: positions are [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), ...]. So (5,4) has food on it, but it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n> \n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> \n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and causes collision.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,4). Head is at (4,3), so not adjacent to tail. Distance: x-diff 2, y-diff 1, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing a side, like (3,4) or (4,2) etc.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, but walls take cells.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7.

Life span decreases every turn, including current turn t=27.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it can be eaten only on turns where turn <= t + L - 1 or something.\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t=27, life span=9, meaning it will disappear at the end of turn 27 + 9 - 1? Or when countdown reaches 0?\n> \n> Better to think: countdown starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown = life_span, and it decreases each turn.

But for eating, as long as it's present when head moves onto it.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, then after L turns, it will be gone. So for turn t, it has L turns left including turn t.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t+L-1, and disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, countdown = L-1, and so on, until countdown=0 after some turn, then it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as countdown >0 when the head moves to that cell.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 27, food at (5,4) has life_span 9, so countdown=9. After turn 27, countdown=8, and so on. It will be present until after turn 35? Let's see:\n> \n> Start of turn 27: countdown=9\n> \n> After turn 27 (end of turn): countdown=8\n> \n> Start of turn 28: countdown=8\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 35: countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 36 or at the end of turn 35?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> From turn t, after N turns, it disappears. So at turn t, it has N full turns left.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, with life_span N, it can be eaten on any turn from t to t+N-1.\n> \n> After turn t+N-1, it disappears.\n> \n> Here t=27, N=9, so can be eaten from turn 27 to turn 35 inclusive. Disappears before turn 36.\n> \n> Turn 27 to 35 is 9 turns: 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. Yes.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Current head position: (4,3), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3): since head direction is L, but that was the direction it came from. The current direction is given as \"L\", meaning it was moving left to get to (4,3), so from (5,3) to (4,3).\n> \n> For next move, I can choose U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse, so I cannot move right (opposite of left), so cannot move R.\n> \n> Available moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, adjacent cells to head (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: (4,4)\n> \n> - Down: (4,2)\n> \n> - Left: (3,3)\n> \n> - Right: (5,3) but (5,3) is the first body segment, so moving right would collide with body, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, walls: (4,2) is not a wall?

Let me plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which means left, so last move was to the left, to (3,3) from... since positions are head first, (3,3) is head, then (4,3), so it moved left from (4,3) to (3,3), so previous direction was left.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,4), life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn, so it will vanish after turn 28 + 8 - 1? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 28, life span is 8, so after 8 more turns, it's gone?

Moving there would cause collision, since head touches body.

Food positions: (5,4) and (4,3). (3,4) is not listed as food, so no food there.\n> \n> (3,4) is the tail, but no food on it, so moving to (3,4) should be safe because after moving, head goes to (3,4), and the tail (which was at (3,4)) moves to the next position? Let's see what happens when I move.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so if I move to the tail position, since the tail moves, it doesn't stay, so no collision.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the current tail position, after the move, the head is there, and the tail has moved away, so no collision.\n> \n> But if there is food on the tail cell, and I eat it, then the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head is on that cell, so collision with the new tail? Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the head is at (3,3), tail is at (3,4), which is adjacent? (3,3) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically, so yes, head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Tail cell (3,4) has food? Food positions are (5,4) and (4,3), not (3,4), so no food on tail, so moving to (3,4) should be fine; no growth, tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - x=0: all y\n> \n> - x=7: all y\n> \n> - y=0: all x\n> \n> - y=7: all x\n> \n> - and (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Now snake: positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> So let's plot y from bottom to top or top to bottom? Usually in grids, y=0 bottom or top? But since it's coordinates, I'll assume (x,y) with x horizontal, y vertical, and I can think y increasing up or down? Doesn't matter, but for consistency, let's assume y increases upwards, so (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> So from (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) up, to (5,5) up, to (4,5) left, to (3,5) left, to (3,4) down?

It's turn 29. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (3,4) from below, so previous position was (3,3), but since it's moving Up, from (3,3) to (3,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. So head at (3,4), and tail at (3,5)? Let's list them in order: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (3,3), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (5,3), index 4: (5,4), index 5: (5,5), index 6: (4,5), index 7: (3,5) tail. Tail is (3,5), but in the positions, it's last, so (3,5) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value 1 each.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,4), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down next. Opposite of Up is Down, so Down is not allowed. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - Up: from (3,4) to (3,5)\n> \n> - Left: from (3,4) to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right: from (3,4) to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,5) is y=5, which is within 0 to 7, no border wall. Internal obstacles: let's list them: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). None of these are at (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4), so no wall collisions for any move.\n> \n> Now, body collisions: snake body positions are (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> If I move Up to (3,5), that's where the tail is. But moving to tail is allowed because when the snake moves, the tail will also move forward, so it's not a collision. Only if it's not the tail, it's a collision. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to (3,5) is the tail, so it should be safe, as long as after moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,4): is (2,4) a body segment? Current positions: (3,4) head, (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). (2,4) not in list, so no body.\n> \n> Moving to (4,4): not in positions, so no body.\n> \n> So all three moves are possible without immediate collision.\n> \n> Now, food: there is food at (5,4) and (4,3).\n> \n> (5,4) is a body segment? Current snake positions: (5,4) is index 4, so it's part of the body. But food can be under the body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is index 2 in snake positions, so also under body.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) and (4,3) are both under snake body.\n> \n> To eat them, the snake needs to move so that the body leaves those cells, and then head moves onto them.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (5,4) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 29, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 29 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we see it, life span L means it has L turns left including this one. After turn t, L decreases by 1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 29, life span 7, so:\n> \n> - After turn 29, life span becomes 6\n> \n> - After turn 30, becomes 5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - After turn 35, becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 36 or at the start of turn 36? Probably at the end of the turn when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> But for planning, we know it will be there for turns 29 to 35 inclusive, and disappear after turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) life span 9, so present from turn 29 to 37 inclusive, disappear after turn 37.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (since D is opposite and not allowed)\n> \n> If I move Up to (3,5): (3,5) is the current tail position. After moving, the head goes to (3,5), and since it's not eating food (no food there), the snake grows by 0, so tail stays, but when head moves to (3,5), which was tail, the tail segment moves away? Let's simulate.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - If no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> - If food eaten, tail is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (3,5), which is the current tail, and no food there, so:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then body: previous head (3,4) becomes new segment 1\n> \n> - (3,3) becomes segment 2\n> \n> - (4,3) segment 3\n> \n> - (5,3) segment 4\n> \n> - (5,4) segment 5\n> \n> - (5,5) segment 6\n> \n> - (4,5) segment 7\n> \n> - Tail was (3,5), but head moved there, so the tail position is vacated? When head moves to the tail cell, and no food eaten, the tail moves to the previous position? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment shifts to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> - If new head position had food, then tail does not move, snake length increases.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves off its position.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If that cell has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows, so the tail stays where it is (but the segments shift, so the old tail remains, and new segment is added at head).\n> \n> - If no food, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward without growing.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): (3,5) has no food, since food is at (5,4) and (4,3), not at (3,5).

But it's not under the head; it's under a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, another food at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8. (4,3) is also part of the snake body; it's the 4th segment.\n> \n> Both foods are under the snake's body.\n> \n> Now, for food under body, it can be eaten only if:\n> \n> 1. The body moves away (so that cell becomes empty)\n> \n> 2. Then head moves onto that cell.\n> \n> But in this case, both are under body, not head.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, I need to see where the tail is. Snake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) so tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5). Head is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,4) to (4,5): delta x=2, delta y=1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, not directly adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can go L (continue left), or U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Head at (2,4). Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,5)  // up, y+1\n> \n> - D: (2,3)  // down, y-1\n> \n> - L: (1,4)  // left, x-1\n> \n> But (1,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,4), yes, from the list: (1,4) is an obstacle.\n> \n> So moving L to (1,4) is not possible because it's an obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (2,5): is that free? (2,5) not in obstacles? Obstacles: internal (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), etc. (1,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed. Borders: y=5 is not border, y=0 and y=7 are borders. So y=5 is ok, x=2 ok, so (2,5) should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4) head, (3,4), (3,3), etc., no (2,5), so (2,5) is empty and not obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (2,3): (2,3) not in obstacles, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,3), (4,3), but not (2,3), so (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> L to (1,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,4): U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or L but L is blocked, so only U and D possible? But direction is L, and L is invalid, so I can go U or D.\n> \n> But I can also go L, but it's blocked, so not possible. So only U and D are valid moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the food:\n> \n> Food 1: at (5,4), value 1, life span 6. But (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake body (5th segment? Positions: index 0: (2,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5). So (5,4) is position 5, which is body.\n> \n> Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 30, life span 6, so it will disappear on turn 36? Let's see: on turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it might be gone? Or at the end of turn t + N -1?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn when it appears, countdown starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> For food at (5,4), life span 6 on turn 30, so countdown: turn 30: 6, turn 31:5, ..., turn 35:1, turn 36:0, disappears on turn 36. So it can be eaten from turn 30 to 35, but on turn 30 it's under snake, so not eatable until body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3), value 1, life span 8, so disappears on turn 38 (turn 30:8, 31:7, ..., 37:1, 38:0).\n> \n> Now, both foods are under body, so to eat them, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Also, the snake needs to navigate to eat them safely.\n> \n> But there might be other considerations; I need to look for open spaces or other food, but currently, only these two foods are listed, so I think these are the only foods present.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions: (5,4,6,1) and (4,3,8,1)\" so only two foods, both under snake body.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns, but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> I'll make a small grid representation.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and internal obstacles at:\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> And snake: head (2,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> So (4,3) has food under it, and (5,4) has food under it.\n> \n> Now, the snake is moving, so each turn, the head moves, and the tail moves forward, so the body shifts.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> If it eats food, length increases, so tail stays, and a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> For food under body, it can be eaten only after the body leaves that cell.\n> \n> For example, food at (5,4): currently occupied by segment 5. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves, so segment 7 (tail) moves, but segment 5 is still there until the snake moves enough that that part shifts.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: let's label segments:\n> \n> S0: (2,4) head\n> \n> S1: (3,4)\n> \n> S2: (3,3)\n> \n> S3: (4,3)  // food here\n> \n> S4: (5,3)\n> \n> S5: (5,4)  // food here\n> \n> S6: (5,5)\n> \n> S7: (4,5) tail\n> \n> Now, on next turn, turn 31, I move the head to a new position.\n> \n> Say I move to U (2,5) or D (2,3).\n> \n> If I move to (2,5), new head position, then the body shifts: S0 moves to (2,5), S1 moves to old S0 (2,4)? No.\n> \n> When head moves, the new head is at the new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: after head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new pos, then S1 at old S0, S2 at old S1, ..., up to tail at old second last.\n> \n> In this case, after move, tail (S7) is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, and length increases.\n> \n> For the food under S3: (4,3), when will it be vacated?\n> \n> S3 is at (4,3). When the snake moves, if the head doesn't eat, the tail moves, but S3 will move to a new position only when the segment in front moves.\n> \n> For example, when S2 moves, S3 will move to old S2 position.\n> \n> But S2 is at (3,3), which is connected.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Suppose on turn 30, I move head to (2,5) (U).\n> \n> Then new head: (2,5)\n> \n> Then S1 moves to old head (2,4)\n> \n> S2 moves to old S1 (3,4)\n> \n> S3 moves to old S2 (3,3)\n> \n> S4 moves to old S3 (4,3)  // but (4,3) has food, but S4 is moving to it, so it's still occupied.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,5)\n> \n> S1 at (2,4)  // old S0\n> \n> S2 at (3,4)  // old S1\n> \n> S3 at (3,3)  // old S2\n> \n> S4 at (4,3)  // old S3, so (4,3) is still occupied by S4 now\n> \n> S5 at (5,3)  // old S4\n> \n> S6 at (5,4)  // old S5\n> \n> S7 at (5,5)  // old S6\n> \n> But tail was S7 at (4,5), which is not occupied anymore; it moved to old S6 (5,5), so (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> But food at (4,3) is still under S4, and at (5,4) is under S6? S6 at (5,4) now.\n> \n> Previously S5 at (5,4), now S6 at (5,4), so (5,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is occupied by S4.\n> \n> So the food cells are still under body.\n> \n> To vacate them, the snake needs to move such that those segments are not there anymore.\n> \n> For example, food at (5,4): it is currently occupied by S5. S5 will be vacated when the tail moves past it, but since tail is at S7, it will take a few moves.\n> \n> The segment occupying (5,4) is S5. When the snake moves, S5 will move to a new position only if the segment in front moves, but it's a chain.\n> \n> The cell (5,4) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since segments move one by one, when the tail moves off it or something.\n> \n> In this case, S5 is at (5,4). After a move, if no eat, S5 moves to the position of S4 previous, but S4 is at (5,3), so when S4 moves, S5 moves to where S4 was.\n> \n> But (5,4) cell is left empty only if no segment moves to it.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell occupied by a body segment, it will be vacated when that segment moves to a new position and no new segment comes in, but in snake movement, when the head moves, the segment that was at that position moves, so the cell is vacated if it was the tail, or if it's not the tail, the next segment moves to it, so it's never instantly vacated except for the tail cell when no growth.\n> \n> The only cell that can be vacated is the tail cell when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For other body cells, when the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, and other cells remain occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For example, in the move above, when head moved to (2,5), the tail cell (4,5) was vacated, and all other cells are still occupied but shifted.\n> \n> The food at (5,4) was occupied by S5, and after move, it's occupied by S6, so still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) was S3, now S4, still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate a body cell, it needs to be the tail at some point.\n> \n> For food at (5,4), it is currently occupied by S5. S5 will become the tail only after several moves, when the tail catches up, but the tail is S7, so it needs to move forward.\n> \n> The segment at (5,4) is the 5th segment out of 8, so it will take 3 moves for it to become the tail, if no food is eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,3), it's S3, which is closer to head, so it will become tail sooner.\n> \n> Let's calculate how many moves until a segment becomes the tail.\n> \n> The tail is the last segment. When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so the segment that was second last becomes the new tail.\n> \n> After one move without eating, the old tail is gone, and the new tail is the previous S6.\n> \n> In this case, current segments: S0 to S7.\n> \n> After one move no eat: new segments S0' at new head, S1' at old S0, S2' at old S1, S3' at old S2, S4' at old S3, S5' at old S4, S6' at old S5, and old S6 and S7 are gone? No.\n> \n> Positions: head new, then S1 at old S0, S2 at old S1, S3 at old S2, S4 at old S3, S5 at old S4, S6 at old S5, S7 at old S6, and old S7 is vacated.\n> \n> So the new tail is at old S6 position.\n> \n> The segment that was S5 is now S6, and so on.\n> \n> For a particular cell, like (5,4) occupied by S5. After one move no eat, S5 moves to old S4 position, which is (5,3), and S6 moves to old S5 position (5,4), so (5,4) is now occupied by S6.\n> \n> After second move no eat, S6 moves to where S5 was, which is (5,3), and S7 moves to where S6 was (5,4), so (5,4) occupied by S7.\n> \n> After third move no eat, S7 moves to where S6 was (5,3), and since no new tail, the cell (5,4) is vacated? Let's see:\n> \n> After second move: positions assume no change for simplicity, but positions change as head moves.\n> \n> I need to assume the head movement.\n> \n> To vacate (5,4), it needs to be the tail position when the snake moves.\n> \n> Currently, (5,4) is occupied by S5, which is not tail. The tail is S7 at (4,5).\n> \n> S5 will become the tail after 2 moves, because after first move, S5 becomes S6, after second move, S6 becomes S7 (tail), then on the third move, when snake moves, if no eat, the tail (S7) moves, vacating (5,4) if it was there.\n> \n> But the position changes.\n> \n> Let's simulate with head moving.\n> \n> Suppose I move the head in a way that the snake doesn't grow, so tail moves each turn.\n> \n> Start turn 30: positions: S0(2,4), S1(3,4), S2(3,3), S3(4,3), S4(5,3), S5(5,4), S6(5,5), S7(4,5)\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (5,4).\n> \n> Now, suppose on turn 30, I move head to (2,5) U.\n> \n> Then new positions turn 31:\n> Head: (2,5)\n> S1: (2,4)  // old S0\n> S2: (3,4)  // old S1\n> S3: (3,3)  // old S2\n> S4: (4,3)  // old S3  // food here\n> S5: (5,3)  // old S4\n> S6: (5,4)  // old S5  // food here\n> S7: (5,5)  // old S6\n> Tail was at (4,5), now vacated.\n> \n> (4,3) still occupied by S4, (5,4) by S6.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) under S4, at (5,4) under S6.\n> \n> Now turn 31, head at (2,5), direction was L, but now head at (2,5), so new direction depends on move.\n> \n> From (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not instant reverse.

It's turn 31, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I have to account for internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving towards increasing y, so from (2,5), moving Up would go to (2,6).\n> \n> But (2,6) is an internal obstacle? Let me check the obstacles: (2,6) is listed, so (2,6) is a wall, so moving Up is not possible because it would hit the wall.\n> \n> Head is at (2,5), direction Up, so next move if I choose U would be to (2,6), but (2,6) is an obstacle, so that move is invalid and would cause a collision. I need to avoid that.\n> \n> Available moves from current head position (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6) – but (2,6) is an obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,4) – but (2,4) is the second segment of the snake. Since the head is moving to where the body is, but in snake, when you move, the tail moves, so it might be possible if that cell becomes free.\n> \n> Let's think carefully about movement and collisions.\n> \n> Rule: Body collision – head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,5), moving Down to (2,4): (2,4) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head would be at (2,4), and the tail will move from (5,5) to whatever the next position is, but since the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,4) will move to (2,5) or something? I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead of it. The tail segment is left, so the cell it occupied becomes free, unless the snake eats food and grows.\n> \n> In this case, if I move Down to (2,4), which is currently occupied by the body. After the move, the head is now at (2,4), and the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where the head was, (2,5), and so on, down to the tail. The tail was at (5,5), and it will move to (5,4) because the segment before it was (5,4) moving to (5,3) or something. Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Current snake positions: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: tail (5,5)\n> \n> If I move Down to (2,4), the new head position is (2,4). Then, the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to old head position (2,5), segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (2,4) but that's where new head is, it's messy.\n> \n> Better to think: after moving head to new cell, each body segment from 1 to 7 moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new position 0: (2,4)  // head moved down\n> \n> Then position 1 (which was at (2,4)) moves to where position 0 was, which is (2,5)\n> \n> Position 2 (was (3,4)) moves to where position 1 was, (2,4) but now occupied by new head? No, positions are updated sequentially.\n> \n> When updating, we start from the tail or head? Typically, we move the tail first or something. In terms of grid occupation, after the move, the new head is at the new position, and each subsequent segment occupies the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after moving down:\n> \n> - New head: (2,4)  // from (2,5) moved down\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (which was at (2,4)) now moves to the old position of segment 0, which is (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was (3,4)) moves to the old position of segment 1, which was (2,4) but now that's where new head is, conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong. Standard way: when the snake moves, the head goes to the new cell, and each body segment from 1 to k moves to the position that segment was previously occupying, but since the head moved, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, and so on, and the tail position is vacated unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - New position of head: (x_new, y_new)\n> \n> - New position of segment i: old position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to len-1\n> \n> In this case, segment 1 (index 1) was at (2,4), it moves to old position of segment 0, which is (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 2 (index 2) was at (3,4), it moves to old position of segment 1, which is (2,4)\n> \n> But (2,4) is now the new head position? No, the positions are: after move, the cell (2,4) is occupied by the head, so when segment 1 moves to (2,5), that's fine, then segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which is (2,4), but (2,4) is now occupied by the head, so it would be overlapping.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself. Let's list the positions before move:\n> \n> - Seg0: (2,5)\n> \n> - Seg1: (2,4)\n> \n> - Seg2: (3,4)\n> \n> - Seg3: (3,3)\n> \n> - Seg4: (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg6: (5,4)\n> \n> - Seg7: (5,5)  // tail\n> \n> After moving head Down to (2,4):\n> \n> - New seg0: (2,4)\n> \n> - Then new seg1: old seg0 position (2,5)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (2,4) but (2,4) is now occupied by new seg0, so seg2 would be at (2,4), but that's the same as head, collision? No, because the positions are assigned sequentially, but in terms of the grid, at the moment of move, (2,4) is free for the head to move to? No, (2,4) is currently occupied by seg1.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move to a cell occupied by the body, except that you can move to the tail cell because the tail will move.\"\n> \n> From the rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, (2,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> So moving to (2,4) which is occupied by seg1, not tail, so that would be a body collision and kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Left to (1,5): let's check if that's valid.\n> \n> (1,5): is it a wall or obstacle?\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) are listed, so (1,5) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving Right to (3,5): is (3,5) free? Let's see what's at (3,5).\n> \n> No walls at (3,5): walls are x=0,7 y=0,7 borders, and internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So (3,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, no snake body at (3,5)? Current snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (3,5) is not occupied, so moving Right to (3,5) should be possible.\n> \n> Moving Down to (2,4) is not possible because it's occupied by body and not tail.\n> \n> Moving Up to (2,6) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (2,5) with head direction Up are: since direction is Up, I can move Left, Right, or Up, but Up is wall, so Left or Right.\n> \n> Left to (1,5): but (1,5) is obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> Right to (3,5): seems free.\n> \n> What about Down? Down is opposite to current direction? Current direction is Up, so moving Down is reverse, but the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move Down on this turn because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Is that correct? Let me read: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> The rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> So for this turn, since current direction is U, I cannot choose D as the move.\n> \n> Similarly, I can choose U, L, or R.\n> \n> But U is blocked by wall at (2,6), L is blocked by obstacle at (1,5), so only possible move is R to (3,5).\n> \n> Is that right? (3,5) is not occupied and not a wall, so yes.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think, since borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are at x=1, so for y, (1,5) is obstacle.\n> \n> (2,6) obstacle.\n> \n> (4,1), (4,2) obstacles.\n> \n> (4,6), (5,6) obstacles.\n> \n> Now (3,5): x=3, y=5, not in obstacles, and not border, so free.\n> \n> Snake positions: all listed, no (3,5), so free.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (3,5).\n> \n> But I need to think about future turns as well, since I have to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The action sequence should start from turn t1=31, and I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there are food items.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,4), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 31, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 35?

Let's index: position 0: (3,5) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is position 5, which is a body segment, not head or tail directly.\n> \n> But food is at (4,3) with life span 6, value 1.

Snake positions: all listed, (1,3) not in list, so it's free, but might be obstacle?

Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. So (3,6) is within, x=3 between 1-6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So the grid interior is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, for example, (1,1) to (6,6) might be playable, but borders are walls, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles are invalid.\n> \n> So for (3,5), moving:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6). (3,6): x=3, y=6. y=6 is not y=7, so not border wall. Is it obstacle? Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (3,6) not in list, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), etc., no (3,6), so (3,6) is empty and valid.\n> \n> - D: to (3,4). (3,4) is part of snake body, position 3: (3,4). So moving there would cause body collision, since head touches body segment. Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. Except when moving into tail cell, because tail moves.\n> \n> But (3,4) is not tail; tail is at (5,4). (3,4) is a body segment, so moving to (3,4) would collide with body, die.\n> \n> Similarly, L: left to (2,5). But (2,5) is position 1 of snake, body segment. So moving there collides with body. Also, cannot move L because it's reverse direction? Current direction R, reverse is L, so cannot move L, but even if I could, it's occupied.\n> \n> R: right to (4,5). (4,5): is it wall? x=4, y=5. Not border. Obstacles? (4,6), (4,1), (4,2), etc., not (4,5). Snake? No, positions have (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). No (4,5), so (4,5) is empty and valid.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), R to (4,5), D to (3,4) but occupied by body, invalid. L to (2,5) occupied and reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So only U or R possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, food considerations.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is under tail. Life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> Current turn t=32, food at (5,4) has life_span 4, so it will disappear at turn 32 + 4 = 36? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, life_span=4, after this turn, at turn 33, it becomes 3, then turn 34:2, turn 35:1, turn 36:0 and disappears? Or at turn 36 it is gone, so it can be eaten up to turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) life_span 6, disappears at turn 32 + 6 = 38? Turn 32: life=6, turn 33:5, ..., turn 37:1, turn 38:0 gone, so can be eaten up to turn 37.\n> \n> Turn 32: life_span=N, it will be present for N more turns? Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, then after the turn, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1. When life_span=0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and if not, at the end of turn, life_span decreases to L-1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears, so it cannot be eaten on turns when life_span=0.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L, after turn, if not eaten, it becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains. When life_span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (5,4), life_span=4 at turn 32. So:\n> \n> - Turn 32: can be eaten, after turn life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 33: life_span=3, can be eaten, after turn=2\n> \n> - Turn 34: life_span=2, can be eaten, after turn=1\n> \n> - Turn 35: life_span=1, can be eaten, after turn=0, disappears\n> \n> - Turn 36: gone\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) life_span=6 at turn 32:\n> \n> - Turn 32 to 37: can be eaten, disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> Turn 32: life=6, after turn 32: life=5 if not eaten\n> \n> Turn 33: life=5, after:4 if not eaten\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 37: life=1, after:0, disappears\n> \n> Turn 38: gone\n> \n> Food at (1,3) life_span=9 at turn 32:\n> \n> - Can be eaten from turn 32 to 40, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From head (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n> \n> I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,4) with food under it. But head is not adjacent to tail. Head at (3,5), tail at (5,4), distance: |3-5|=2 in x, |5-4|=1 in y, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (3,5) and (5,4): not same x or y, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be like (3,5) and (4,5) or (3,4), etc.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> But if I move such that head gets close to tail, I need to be careful.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the two options: move U or move R.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (3,6) at turn 32.\n> \n> Then new head position (3,6).

No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, so the last segment (tail) is removed from that position.\n> \n> So after moving U from (3,5) to (3,6):\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)\n> \n> - Body: segment 1: (3,5)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,5)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,4)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,4)  // previous seg3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,3)  // previous seg4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,3)  // previous seg5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,3)  // previous seg6\n> \n> - Tail was (5,4), which is removed, so no longer there. But food at (5,4) is still there, under where tail was? When tail moves away, the cell is vacated, so food at (5,4) is now exposed and can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But head is now at (3,6), far away.\n> \n> After move U, snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]  // since tail (5,4) removed, and (5,3) is now the tail?

Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is under the tail now.\n> \n> If I then move to (4,3) from (4,4), but (4,3) is occupied by tail, and if I move there, I eat the food, but the head and tail position: when I move to (4,3), the tail is still there, but after move, the tail will move if not eating, but since I am eating, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Rule: if head moves onto food cell, it eats it, and snake grows.\n> \n> But if the food is under the tail, and head moves to it, is there collision?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But here, head at (4,4), tail at (4,3), they are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> If head moves to (4,3), which is tail position with food, then after eating, head is at (4,3), and since eating, tail does not move, so the new segment is added, but the previous tail was at (4,3), now head is at (4,3), and the body includes the previous positions.\n> \n> After move to (4,3) and eat, new head at (4,3), then the previous head position (4,4) becomes body, and the segments follow, with no tail removed, so the snake grows: positions would be [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) was tail but now part of body? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move at turn 33: positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] head (4,5), tail (5,3)? No, after turn 32, positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) so tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is under segment (4,3), which is not tail.\n> \n> If at turn 33 I move D to (4,4), then new positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) and tail (5,3) removed, so tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, at this point, food at (4,3) is under the tail.\n> \n> Then, from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3). Since (4,3) has food and is occupied by tail, when I move head to (4,3), I eat the food, and since eating, the tail does not move, so the new positions: head at (4,3), then previous head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), and the tail (4,3) is not removed, but since head moved to it, it becomes part of the body, and a new segment is added, so snake grows to 9 segments.\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), and since ate, no removal, so the previous tail position is now the new segment? Let's think.\n> \n> The segment that was at (4,3) was the tail before the move, but when head moves to (4,3), that cell has the tail, but after the move, the tail is no longer there because it became part of the body when head occupies it.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment in front, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new cell with food, each segment moves to previous position, but tail does not vacate, so the last position is still occupied, and snake length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to a cell occupied by tail: since the tail will move if not eating, but when eating, tail doesn't move, so the cell is occupied, but head moves to it.\n> \n> There might be a collision if head and tail are the same cell, but in movement, head moves to the cell, and if it was tail, it should be ok as long as it's only the tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But when eating, the tail does not move forward.\n> \n> The Tail Reward Danger specifically addresses when eating food under tail.\n> \n> In this case, head at (4,4), tail at (4,3), adjacent. Tail cell (4,3) has positive food. If head moves to (4,3) to eat it, then after eating, head is at (4,3), and the new tail will be at the end, but since the snake grew, the previous position of the tail is now part of the body, and head is on it, so at that moment, head and body collision? No, after the move, the head is at (4,3), which was the tail position, but it is now the head, and the body segments are behind.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (4,3) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Then the previous positions: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where? The body segments shift.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (4,4) head? No, at the start of turn 33, after previous move, head is at (4,5), but when we move, let's sequence.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn 33, before action, positions are: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] with head at (4,5).\n> \n> I move D to (4,4).\n> \n> After move, not eating, so new positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) and tail (5,3) removed, so positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is under tail.\n> \n> Now, at this point, head at (4,4), tail at (4,3), adjacent.\n> \n> Tail cell has positive food.\n> \n> If I move head to (4,3), I will eat the food.\n> \n> But according to Tail Reward Danger, since head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it will kill the snake because after eating, the head and the newly grown tail will be at the same position or something.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (4,3), then the body: previous head (4,4) becomes segment 1, then (4,5) seg2, (3,5) seg3, (2,5) seg4, (2,4) seg5, (3,4) seg6, (3,3) seg7, and the tail was at (4,3), but since eating, no removal, so the position (4,3) is now head, and the segment that was at (4,3) is not there anymore; instead, the snake has an additional segment at the end.\n> \n> The new tail will be the last position, which was (3,3) or something.\n> \n> Before eating, positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3) and eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - The body segments: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to the new head's previous position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell with food, the head is at the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it, but since no segment is removed, the last position stays occupied.\n> \n> So the new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: position of previous head, which is (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: position of previous seg1, which was (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous seg2, (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous seg3, (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: previous seg4, (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: previous seg5, (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: previous seg6, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: previous seg7, which was (4,3) but (4,3) is now head, so the previous tail position (4,3) is vacated?

It's turn 33, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those cells are blocked. So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But let's confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), with direction R (right). Body segments: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So the tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, in the snake positions, (4,3) is part of the body. Snake positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (4,3) is the 7th segment, and since there are 8 segments, it's not the tail; tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is on a body segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,4) is adjacent to the head? Head is at (4,5), so (5,4) is down-right? Let's see coordinates: x increases right, y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top. But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, but no specification of orientation. Snake head direction is R, which is (x+1,y), so moving right increases x.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5), direction R. So from (4,5), moving right would go to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,4): that's one row down from (5,5), so to reach (5,4) from head at (4,5), I could go down to (4,4) then right to (5,4), or right to (5,5) then down to (5,4), etc.\n> \n> But (5,4) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it will disappear after N turns from now, meaning it can be eaten in the next N turns.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3) has life span 5, and food at (1,3) has life span 8.\n> \n> But (4,3) is under the snake body.

So cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls.

But let's think carefully.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment. But when moving, the body moves after the head. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, except for the tail, it might be a problem.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves, if it moves to a cell that is part of the body except the tail, it collides.

Adjacent cells: (4,5) adjacent to (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6) but (4,6) wall, so neighbors: left (3,5), right (5,5), down (4,4), up (4,6) invalid.\n> \n> (3,5) is body, not tail.

Snake positions: current, (4,5), (3,5), etc., (5,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5) on turn 33, the snake positions become: head (5,5), then body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail still (5,3).\n> \n> Now on turn 34, move D to (5,4).

It's turn 34, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3).

But since food has life spans, I should consider which food might disappear soon.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So for turn 34:\n> \n> - (5,4) has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 35? Life span decreases each turn, so if it has life span 2 on turn 34, it should be gone by turn 36. Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 34, life span is 2, meaning after this turn, it becomes 1, and after turn 35, it becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 36 or on turn 36? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now. But since countdown decreases each turn, including current, after turn t, life span decreases.\n> \n> Better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, then after the turn, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is the life span given.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that if life span is L on turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's see an example.\n> \n> Suppose on turn t, life span L. After turn t, L decreases by 1, so on turn t+1, life span is L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears, so it's not available on the turn when it would be 0.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: at the beginning of turn t, if life span is S, it will disappear after S turns, meaning it will be present for S more turns (t to t+S-1), and gone on turn t+S.\n> \n> For (5,4): life span 2 on turn 34, so it will be present on turns 34 and 35, disappear on turn 36.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): life span 4, present turns 34,35,36,37, disappear turn 38.\n> \n> (1,3): life span 7, present turns 34 to 40, disappear turn 41.\n> \n> (3,2): life span 10, present turns 34 to 43, disappear turn 44.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,5), direction right. Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is R, so from (5,5), moving right would be to (6,5), up to (5,6), down to (5,4).\n> \n> But I need to check walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).\n> \n> So for head at (5,5):\n> \n> - Move right (R) to (6,5): x=6, y=5. Is this a wall? Borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border yet, x=7 is border, so x=6,y=5 should be free, but check internal obstacles. Internal obstacles list: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). None at (6,5), so (6,5) is free.\n> \n> - Move up (U) to (5,6): y=6, x=5. Internal obstacles have (5,6), which is a wall! (5,6) is in the list, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Move down (D) to (5,4): y=4, x=5. Is this a wall? Borders: y=4 is not 0 or 7, internal obstacles: (5,6) is at y=6, others not (5,4), so (5,4) should be free. But there is food at (5,4), but that's fine, we can move to it.\n> \n> - Move left (L) to (4,5): but instant reverse? Current direction is R, moving left would be opposite, so cannot do that on next turn. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since head just moved to (5,5) from (4,5) with direction R, moving to (4,5) would be back, so not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5): R to (6,5), D to (5,4), or U but U to (5,6) is wall, so only R or D.\n> \n> Now, (5,4) has food with short life span, only 2 turns left, meaning it will disappear soon.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) has food, but (4,3) is occupied by the snake's tail? Snake positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So (4,3) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is on the tail cell. But the rule says: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,3) is occupied by the tail. When the snake moves, the tail will move, so if the snake moves in such a way that the tail leaves (4,3), then later head can move to it if food is still there.\n> \n> But food at (4,3) has life span 4, so it might be available later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their positions relative to snake.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,4): close to head, at (5,4), which is directly below (5,5), so moving down eats it immediately on turn 34 if we choose D.\n> \n> - (4,3): on the tail, so need to move so that tail moves away first.\n> \n> - (1,3): far left, might be hard to reach.\n> \n> - (3,2): below and left.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 34: R or D.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4), I eat the food there. Since value +1, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment. When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Rule: when eating food, length increases, so tail stays, head moves to food.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you move to a food, you grow, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the head position, so the tail remains in place for that turn; next turn when you move, tail moves.\n> \n> But here, since food is eaten, the cell is occupied by new head, and tail doesn't move, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> Also, for the tail food: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), it's the tail, but head is not adjacent to tail right now. Head is at (5,5), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (5,5) and (4,3): difference in x is 1, y is 2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (5,5) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart. (5,5) to (4,5) is left, (4,5) to (4,4) down, then to (4,3), etc. Not adjacent.\n> \n> Head is at (5,5), tail at (4,3), so positions: (5,5) to (4,5) is adjacent, but (4,5) is not tail, it's the second segment. Tail is (4,3), which is not adjacent to head directly.\n> \n> So no danger from that food now.\n> \n> But if head were to move to tail cell when tail is about to move, but with the rule.\n> \n> Back to turn 34 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (5,4), eat food. Then snake grows: head moves to (5,4), new segment added, so positions become: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so now 9 segments. Tail still at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Then, new head position (5,4), direction would be down, since we moved down.\n> \n> Now, for next moves.\n> \n> But life span of (5,4) is 2, but we eat it on turn 34, so it's gone.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (6,5). Then no food eaten, snake moves: head to (6,5), tail moves from (4,3) to? When no food eaten, tail moves. Current positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> After moving R: head to (6,5), then body: (5,5) becomes first body, (4,5) second, etc., and tail (4,3) is removed, so new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] and tail was (4,3), which is removed, so now 7 segments? No: the snake has 8 segments. After moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). (4,3) is gone, and (3,3) is now the tail? Let's list: before move: positions index 0 to 7: 0: (5,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After move R: head to (6,5), then segment 0 moves to where head was? Standard: the head moves to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So segment 1 (index 1) moves to position of old head, which is (5,5), segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, which is (4,5), and so on, up to segment 7 (tail) moves to old position of segment 6, which is (3,3). So new positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). And (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is still there, since not eaten, and life span decreases to 3 after turn 34.\n> \n> Also, tail is now at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term. Eating (5,4) now might be tempting, but let's see the risks and opportunities.\n> \n> If I eat (5,4), I grow to 9 segments, but I'm at (5,4), which might be a bit constrained.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) but (5,5) is now part of body, after eating, positions are [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), ...] so (5,5) is body, cannot move there. D to (5,3)? y=3, x=5. Is this wall? Borders y=3 not 0 or 7, internal obstacles: (4,2) is wall, but (5,3) not listed, so should be free. L to (4,4)? x=4,y=4. Free? Not wall. R to (6,4)? x=6,y=4. Free? Not wall or border.\n> \n> But direction: after moving down to (5,4), head direction is D, so for next turn, I can move U, D, L, R, but U to (5,5) is body, so not possible. D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n> \n> (5,3) might be free, but I need to check.\n> \n> If I don't eat, and go to (6,5), then from there, I can move, say, down to (6,4) or up to (6,6) but y=6, x=6, internal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, but (6,6) not listed, borders x=6 not 7, y=6 not 7, so (6,6) might be free, but let's list all walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7.\n> \n> Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So (6,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> From (6,5), moves: U to (6,6)? free, D to (6,4)? free, L to (5,5) which is body, not possible, R to (7,5) but x=7 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> So from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L but L to (5,5) is body, so only U or D.\n> \n> If I go to (6,5), I have fewer options immediately.\n> \n> But let's think about the food at (4,3). It's on the old tail position, which is now vacated if I don't eat (5,4), but if I move R, tail moves to (3,3), so (4,3) is free, and food is there.\n> \n> But to eat it, head needs to move to (4,3).\n> \n> Currently head at (6,5) after move, which is far.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider a sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,2) and (1,3), but (1,3) is near walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so around (1,3) it might be tricky.\n> \n> (3,2) is below, with life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (5,4) has short life, only available for turns 34 and 35.

Body positions: after eating, snake is [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so cells occupied: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So (5,3) is free, (4,4) is free, (6,4) free, etc.\n> \n> Move D to (5,3): then no food, so snake moves, head to (5,3), tail moves from (4,3) to (3,3)? After move, head to (5,3), then body: (5,4), (5,5), etc., tail (4,3) moves to old position of segment before tail, which is (3,3), so (4,3) vacated. But food at (4,3) is still there, life span now 3 after turn 34, so on turn 35, life span 3, still present.\n> \n> But head is at (5,3), not at (4,3).\n> \n> From (5,4), move L to (4,4): (4,4) is free, no food, so move there, then snake moves, head to (4,4), tail moves, (4,3) vacated.\n> \n> Then from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) to eat food, but (4,3) has food, and if I move to it, I eat it.\n> \n> But is there tail reward danger?

(4,4) is free, no food, so move head to (4,4), then since no food eaten, tail moves: the last segment (4,3) is removed, and each segment moves, so new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3).

It's turn 35. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those coordinates are walls. So the grid is 8x8, with walls on the edges. Internal obstacles are given: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So I need to avoid those too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So that's 9 segments. Head direction is down, so currently moving down.\n> \n> Food: three items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 3. But (4,3) is also part of the snake body; it's the tail end. Snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So (4,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) with life span 3 and value 1. But it's under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current head is at (5,4), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (5,4) to (4,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent horizontally or vertically; it's diagonal. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right—not diagonal. So (5,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Other food: (1,3) value 1, life span 6\n> \n> (3,2) value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3) it's 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at current turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 after this turn, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (4,3), life span 3 at turn 35. After turn 35, it becomes 2; after turn 36, it becomes 1; after turn 37, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 35, 36, or 37, but only if head moves to it when it's accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 6: will last until turn 40 (35 to 40 is 6 turns? Turn 35: life=6, after turn 35: life=5, ..., after turn 40: life=0, disappear. So available from turn 35 to 40 inclusive? After turn 40, it's gone, so last chance to eat is turn 40.\n> \n> Let's define: at the start of turn t, life span is L. After the turn, it decreases to L-1. If head moves to it during turn t, it's eaten, and then life span doesn't decrease further for that food since it's consumed.\n> \n> But for the food under body, it might not be accessible yet.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4), moving down. Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). In grid coordinates, y=0 is bottom? Typically in such games, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here it says U (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think? U: (x,y+1) so moving up increases y. D: (x,y-1) decreases y, so down. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> But in positions, snake head at (5,4), which is x=5, y=4. Moving down, so if it moves down, to (5,3).\n> \n> But let's see possible moves from (5,4) with current direction down.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so possible moves: since no instant reverse, cannot move up (U). So can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, check for walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, move down to (5,3): is there a wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so (5,3) is within bounds, y=3 between 0 and 7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are playable? No: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7), etc. all are walls. So playable cells are where 1 <= x <=6 and 1 <= y <=6.\n> \n> Yes, so (5,3) is (5,3), x=5 between 1-6, y=3 between 1-6, so no wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in that list, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Now, is it occupied by body?

Within bounds. Not in obstacles? Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), etc. (4,4) not listed. Body: positions have (5,4), (5,5), etc., (4,5) is body, (4,4) not in list, so free. So possible.\n> \n> Move right to (6,4): x=6, y=4. x=6 is within 1-6? x=6 is not border? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable. y=4 playable. Not in obstacles: obstacles don't have (6,4). Body: no, so possible.\n> \n> Cannot move up to (5,5) because that's the body segment directly behind head? Head is at (5,4), second segment is (5,5), so moving up to (5,5) would be into body, which is deadly. Also, instant reverse is not allowed, but since current direction is down, moving up is reverse, so doubly not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (4,3) with life 3, at turn 35.

No: head at (5,4), then next is (5,5), which is up? y=5 > y=4, so from (5,4) to (5,5) is moving up? But current direction is down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (5,4), second segment (5,5). Since U is (x,y+1), so (5,5) has higher y, so it's north of (5,4). But current head direction is given as D, down. That means the snake was moving down to (5,4), so previous head was at (5,5), moved down to (5,4). Yes, that makes sense.

Head at (4,3), tail at (3,3), which are adjacent (left-right). And tail has food? The food was at (4,3), which is now head, so it's eaten, so the cell (3,3) doesn't have food; food is only at specific positions. After eating, the food is consumed, so no food at tail.\n> \n> The danger is only if the tail cell has food when you eat it, but in this case, when head moves to (4,3), it eats the food there, so no issue with tail.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> But here, when eating (4,3), the tail is at (3,3), and (3,3) does not have food; only (4,3) had food.

No.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head, 1: neck, etc., up to 8: tail.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)  // moved down\n> \n> - Then, segment 1 (was at pos 1: (5,4)) moves to where head was, (6,4)?

No, when no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, the tail cell (3,3) is vacated, and the new positions are from new head to new tail.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> Tail is now (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is still there, not eaten.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,3), direction was R, but after moving D, new direction is D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3): U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n> \n> So possible: D, L, R.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) - check if valid. (6,2): not border wall? x=6 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, not in obstacles: obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (6,2) not listed, so free. Snake positions: (6,3), (6,4), etc., no (6,2), so ok.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) - (5,3) not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2), etc., no (5,3).

Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> At turn 36, food at (4,3) has life span 2, meaning it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37. After turn 37, it disappears, so not available on turn 38.\n> \n> So to eat (4,3), I must be on (4,3) on turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> On turn 36, I was at (6,4), and I moved to (6,3), not to (4,3).\n> \n> On turn 37, if from (6,3) I move to (5,3), I'm at (5,3), not (4,3).\n> \n> Then on turn 38, I could move to (4,3), but (4,3) is gone by then. Life span: after turn 36, life span decreases to 1; after turn 37, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So on turn 38, it's gone.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (4,3), I need to be on that cell on turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> On turn 36, I could have moved directly if possible, but from (6,4), to go to (4,3) directly? Not adjacent. Adjacent cells are U (6,5), D (6,3), L (5,4) invalid, R (7,4) invalid. So I couldn't go directly to (4,3) from (6,4).\n> \n> On turn 37, I need to be at (4,3). But from (6,3), I can go to (5,3) on turn 37, but (5,3) to (4,3) is adjacent, so only on turn 38 can I reach (4,3) from there, which is too late.\n> \n> From (6,3), if I go left, but to reach (4,3) on turn 37, I need to be adjacent on turn 36, but on turn 36 I was at (6,4) or (6,3), not adjacent to (4,3). (6,4) to (4,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away horizontally and vertically? (6,4) and (4,3): delta x=-2, delta y=-1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so neighbors are (x±1,y) or (x,y±1).\n> \n> From (6,4), neighbors: (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4). None is (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, from (6,3), neighbors: (6,4), (6,2), (5,3), (7,3). (5,3) is one step left, then from (5,3) to (4,3) is next step.\n> \n> So minimum two moves to (4,3) from (6,4): e.g., D to (6,3), then L to (5,3), then on next move to (4,3).

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there are internal obstacles that block some cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all the blocked cells for reference.\n> \n> Blocked cells (walls and obstacles):\n> \n> - Border: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (6,3), then body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is down, meaning it's moving downward.\n> \n> Head is at (6,3), and direction is D, so it was moving down to (6,3) from previous position? Positions are given with head first, so (6,3) is head, then (6,4) is the first body segment, which is above it since y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake is at y=3 and y=4, so let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake head at (6,3), body at (6,4). Since (6,4) is directly above (6,3) if y increases upward, but direction is down, meaning it moved from a higher y to lower y? I need to standardize.\n> \n> In many grid systems, y=0 is top, y increases downward, or y=0 is bottom, y increases upward. But here, since direction is down and head is at (6,3) with (6,4) behind, it suggests that (6,4) has a higher y-value if y increases downward. But walls: y=0 and y=7, with y=0 being a border. Let's see the food positions.\n> \n> Food at (4,3), (1,3), (3,2), (6,4). (6,4) is a food position, but (6,4) is also occupied by the snake's body.\n> \n> Head direction: since it's moving down, and positions: head (6,3), next segment (6,4), so from (6,4) to (6,3) is downward if we assume y increases downward. I think it's standard in such games to have y increasing downward, so (0,0) top-left, (6,6) bottom-right or something. But walls: x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7. Let's assume (0,0) is top-left, x increases right, y increases down. So y=0 is top row, y=7 is bottom row? But y=7 is a wall, so playable y from 1 to 6? Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (6,3), which is bottom row if y increases down? y=3, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6, with y=1 top, y=6 bottom? Let's define.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's set coordinates: assume (1,1) is top-left, (6,1) top-right, (1,6) bottom-left, (6,6) bottom-right. y=1 top, y=6 bottom, y increases downward.\n> \n> So head at (6,3): x=6, y=3, which is right side, middle height.\n> \n> Body: (6,4) which is one row below, since y=4 > y=3, so (6,4) is south of (6,3)? No: if y increases down, (6,3) is above (6,4). So from (6,4) to (6,3) is moving north, but head direction is down? Contradiction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down, which should mean decreasing y if y increases down, or increasing y if y increases up. I think I have a mess.\n> \n> Perhaps y increases upward. Let's look at the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n> \n> If we assume (1,1) bottom-left or top-left.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), next segment (6,4). If y increases upward, then (6,4) has higher y, so it's north of (6,3), so moving from (6,4) to (6,3) is south, down. Direction D means down, so y decreasing if y up, or y increasing if y down.\n> \n> Standard: in many systems, for simplicity, let's assume (0,0) top-left, x right, y down. So y=0 top, y=6 bottom for playable, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6, with y=1 top, y=6 bottom.\n> \n> So head (6,3): x=6 (right), y=3 (middle).\n> \n> Body (6,4): x=6, y=4, which is one row below y=3, so south.\n> \n> But if snake is moving down, from previous position, it must have come from above. Positions are head first, so the snake was at some position before (6,3), and moved to (6,3) with direction down.\n> \n> The list is current positions: head at (6,3), then the next segment is the one behind, which is (6,4), so when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail follows.\n> \n> At this state, head is at (6,3), and the first body segment is at (6,4), which is adjacent and south of it? (6,3) and (6,4): if y increases down, (6,3) is above (6,4), so (6,4) is south of (6,3).\n> \n> But the head is at (6,3), and the body is at (6,4), which means the head just moved to (6,3) from the north, so from (6,2) or something, but (6,2) is not in the body positions; the positions are only the current segments.\n> \n> The direction \"D\" means the snake is facing down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Head direction is given as \"D\", meaning the current facing direction, which limits the next move: cannot move opposite, so since it's down, it cannot move up next.\n> \n> The positions: head at (6,3), body at (6,4), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> Since body is at (6,4), and head at (6,3), that means the snake moved south to (6,3), so the previous head position was north of (6,3), but it's not listed since it's not current.\n> \n> So for movement, from current head (6,3), it can move to adjacent cells: up (north) to (6,2), down (south) to (6,4) but (6,4) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision unless it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - Up: (6,2) - if valid\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) - but occupied by body, so deadly unless it's the tail and we move there when tail moves.\n> \n> - Left: (5,3)\n> \n> - Right: (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so right is invalid.\n> \n> Also, walls at x=7, y=0, y=7, etc.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) value 1, life span 1 (so disappears after this turn if not eaten?

It's turn 38, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, I have to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So the tail is at (2,4). The snake head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,3) from (6,3), I assume.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so each gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (1,3), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 38, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 41 (since turn 38,39,40,41: 4 turns including current).\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will be there until turn t + N - 1, I think? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life_span is N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, to N-2, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn t + N? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N. On turn t, countdown is N. After turn t is done, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + N - 1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + N. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,3): at turn 38, life_span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 38,39,40,41. Disappears after turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): life_span 6 at turn 38, so can be eaten turns 38 to 43.\n> \n> (6,4): life_span 9, turns 38 to 46.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction left. So from (5,3), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, to (5,4)? y increases up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume, so y increases upwards.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (5,3), and body: (6,3), (6,4), etc. When head was at (6,3), moved left to (5,3), so from (6,3) to (5,3), that's left, x decreased.\n> \n> Now at (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: up to (5,4)\n> \n> - D: down to (5,2)\n> \n> - L: left to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: right to (6,3) but (6,3) is a body segment? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> So (6,3) is the second segment, which is the body immediately after head. So if I move right to (6,3), that would be collision, because head touches body segment. (6,3) is occupied by the snake body, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is also occupied, it's the fourth segment.\n> \n> List of occupied cells by snake: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> Also, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y in range? But internal obstacles also given.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So all wall cells: border and internal.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) - but (5,4) is occupied by snake body, segment 4. So collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) - is this within bounds? x=5, y=2. y=0 is wall, so y=2 should be ok, but check if wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 is bottom, I assume, since U is y+1.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid from x=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> In the food, we have (1,3), which is x=1,y=3, so yes, grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think? x=0, x=7 walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2), (6,4), all within 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,6): x=4,y=6, but y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, but internal obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) is obstacle, etc.\n> \n> Now, back to moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) - occupied by snake at (5,4), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) - is this free? Check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> (5,2): not a border wall, since y=2>0, y=0 wall. Obstacles: (4,1), (4,2), (1,2), etc. (4,2) is obstacle, but (5,2) is not listed as obstacle. Internal obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So (5,2) is not an obstacle, and not border, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — no (5,2), so free.\n> \n> - L: to (4,3) - check: (4,3) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles listed, (4,3) not among them. So should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (6,3) - but (6,3) is occupied by snake body, segment 2, so collision. Also, instant reverse: from left to right? Current direction is L, moving R would be opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or L. U is occupied, R not allowed and occupied.\n> \n> So only down or left: to (5,2) or (4,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food available: (1,3), (3,2), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is currently occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (6,4), which is the third segment. But food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) has food with value 1 and life span 9. But since it's under the snake body, I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (2,4), and head is at (5,3), not adjacent to tail directly. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Head (5,3), tail (2,4): not adjacent, since not same x or y differing by 1. (5,3) and (2,4) are not adjacent; distance in x and y.\n> \n> So no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells outside are invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles:\n> \n> (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all (x,0) for x=0-7, but since playable x=1-6, y=1-6, so (x,0) and (x,7) for x=1-6 are border walls? No, the border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so for example (1,0), (2,0), ..., (6,0) are walls, similarly (0,1) to (0,6), (7,1) to (7,6), (1,7) to (6,7), (0,0) etc. But since we're only moving within 1-6,1-6, we just avoid those borders.\n> \n> But internal obstacles are within the grid.\n> \n> So obstacle cells: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,6): x=4,y=6\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2\n> \n> (1,5): x=1,y=5\n> \n> (4,1): x=4,y=1\n> \n> (2,6): x=2,y=6\n> \n> (1,4): x=1,y=4\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6\n> \n> (4,2): x=4,y=2\n> \n> Now, free cells are the rest within 1-6,1-6 except these and snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> So occupied by snake.\n> \n> Food at: (1,3), (3,2), (6,4) — but (6,4) is occupied by snake body, so food is there but not accessible yet.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) and (3,2) are free, I think.\n> \n> (1,3): not in snake positions, not obstacle?

When I move to (2,3), the tail might have moved.\n> \n> I need to simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Snake moves one cell per turn, head moves, tail moves forward, so the body follows.\n> \n> Current snake: positions in order: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves away, so the snake effectively moves forward.\n> \n> If I move head to (4,3), new positions: head at (4,3), then the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to previous head position, etc.\n> \n> After move to (4,3), new snake: head (4,3), then body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and tail? Tail was (2,4), but since head moved, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, the last segment (tail) is removed, and a new segment is added at head if food eaten, but only when eating food.\n> \n> When not eating, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: let S be the list of positions, S[0] head, S[1] to S[k] body, S[k] tail.\n> \n> When moving without eating, new head position, then S[1] to S[k] remain, but shifted: new body is [new_head] + S[0:-1], so S[0] becomes new head, S[1] becomes the new position for first body segment, which was previous head, and so on, up to the tail, which was S[-2] becomes new tail, and S[-1] is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, positions: indices: 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4) so 9 segments? List has 9 positions, so length 9.\n> \n> After moving head to new position without eating, new snake: head at new pos, then the previous positions from 0 to -2, so positions 1 to 8 become the new body from index 1 to 8, with index 8 being the new tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head: (4,3)\n> \n> - New body: previous positions from index 0 to 7: so (5,3) becomes body segment 1, (6,3) becomes segment 2, (6,4) segment 3, (5,4) segment 4, (5,5) segment 5, (4,5) segment 6, (3,5) segment 7, (2,5) segment 8 (tail)\n> \n> Previous tail (2,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Now, from here, I can move left to (3,3) from (4,3).\n> \n> (3,3) is free?

It's turn 39, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders and some internal obstacles. The internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). That means I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake has 9 segments. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,3) from (5,3).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is 39:\n> \n> - Food at (1,3) has life span 3, so it disappears after turn 41 (since it decreases each turn, including turn 39, so after turn 39 it has 2 left? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.

Snake positions: (6,4) is the fourth segment, index 3 if head is 0. Positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ...] so (6,4) is occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under the body, as per the rules.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is on a cell occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (6,4), since it's under the body, I need the snake to move such that the body is no longer there when the head arrives.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,5), and head is at (4,3). Distance: x diff 2, y diff 2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n> \n> Head (4,3) to tail (2,5): not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, y=0; x=0, y=1; ... up to x=0,y=7 and x=7,y=0 to y=7; similarly y=0 for all x, y=7 for all x.

But no instant reverse, so since I came from right (to left), I cannot go right immediately, because that would be reverse. Head direction is L, meaning it's facing left, so moving left is continuing, up or down are turns, right is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So at turn 39, from (4,3), I can go: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R but R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> R would be to (5,3), but (5,3) is the second segment, so it would collide immediately if I go right.

Snake positions: head to (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc. (3,3) not in snake body? Let's list all body positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So (3,3) not in this list. Walls: x=0, y=0 etc, but (3,3) is within 1-6? x=3,y=3, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is not border.

It's turn 41, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So, I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). That's 10 segments. The head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to (2,3) from (3,3) I assume? Snake positions are listed head first, so from (2,3) to (3,5), with direction L, so it came from right to left to (2,3).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,3), life span 1, that means it will disappear after turn 41, so if not eaten now, it's gone. Turn is 41, life span 1, so after this turn, it should be gone. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life span L, it appears and the countdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn, including the turn it appears. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", so if life span is 1, it disappears after 1 turn, meaning it's only available for one turn. Since countdown decreases including current, for turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose food spawns at turn T with life span N. Countdown starts at N. On turn T, countdown decreases to N-1. If eaten on turn T, fine. If not, on turn T+1, countdown decreases to N-2, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. So for life span N, it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + N - 1, and disappears after turn T + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, if life span 1 on turn 41: countdown starts at 1 on turn 41. If not eaten on turn 41, after turn 41, it disappears. So it's only available on turn 41.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 3 on turn 41: countdown 3 on turn 41, decreases to 2 on turn 42, to 1 on turn 43, to 0 on turn 44, disappears after turn 44. So can be eaten on turns 41,42,43.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 1 → only available on turn 41, must be eaten now or lost.\n> \n> - (3,2): value 1, life span 3 → available on turns 41,42,43\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 6 → available on turns 41 to 46\n> \n> All values are +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,3), direction L, so it just moved left to (2,3). From the positions: snake is [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> So let's plot this on a grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls.

Let's see: snake positions include (6,4), which is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So (6,4) is occupied by the snake body, and food is at (6,4) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (6,4) is on a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5). So not directly a tail danger issue.\n> \n> First, I need to decide the action for turn 41.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,3), direction L, so last move was left to (2,3). Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so cannot move R (right). Can move U (up), D (down), L (left).\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells from (2,3):\n> \n> - Up: (2,4)\n> \n> - Down: (2,2)\n> \n> - Left: (1,3)\n> \n> - Right: (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by body, and also reverse is not allowed, so R is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) has food with life span 1, so if I can eat it now, I should consider it.\n> \n> But let's check if it's safe and possible.\n> \n> First, can I move to (1,3)? (1,3) is within bounds? x=1, y=3, not on border walls since borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,3) is not border. Is it an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) are listed, but (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free, except for the food.\n> \n> But (1,3) has food, and if I move left to it, I can eat it.\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> Moving to (1,3): is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), etc. (1,3) is not in the body list, so it's free except for food. But after moving, the snake will grow since it's positive food.\n> \n> Also, walls: (1,3) is not a wall.\n> \n> So moving left to (1,3) seems possible.\n> \n> But let's see the Tail Reward Danger: head is at (2,3), tail is at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head are (2,4), (2,2), (1,3), (3,3) but (3,3) is body. Tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to head. So no issue.\n> \n> If I eat food at (1,3), snake grows, so after eating, head moves to (1,3), and a new segment is added, so the body extends. Since it was moving left, the new head position is (1,3), and the tail remains until next move.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, when I move to (1,3), I need to ensure it's not colliding with body. Currently, (1,3) is not occupied by body, so it should be fine.\n> \n> After moving, the snake will be: head at (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,5), and since I ate food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new position: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] with 11 segments.\n> \n> Now, is there any immediate danger?

Internal obstacles: (1,5) is wall, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) free.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is south-west.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,5) after move.\n> \n> Another thing: the snake body forms a sort of loop or something? Let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid rows y=0 bottom to y=7 top? Typically in coordinates, y increases up, but in snake, often y=0 bottom, but here it's not specified, but we can assume y=0 bottom or top? Doesn't matter, but for movement, U is y+1, so probably y increases up.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: head (2,3), then to (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So from (2,3) to (6,3) right, then up to (6,4), then left to (5,4), up to (5,5), left to (4,5), left to (3,5). So it's like a path.\n> \n> From (2,4), if I move to (3,4), that might be towards the food at (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is at (3,2), which is down-left from (2,4)?

After moving to (2,4) on turn 41, positions as above, S1 at (2,3), S2 at (3,3), etc.\n> \n> From (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) was tail, but after move, tail is at (4,5), so (3,5) is free now? After turn 41 move U to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), S1 (2,3), S2 (3,3), S3 (4,3), S4 (5,3), S5 (6,3), S6 (6,4), S7 (5,4), S8 (5,5), S9 (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (3,5) is not occupied; it was vacated when tail moved from (3,5) to (4,5)? Old S9 (3,5) moved to new S9 (4,5), so (3,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is free.\n> \n> From (3,4), if head is there, moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) but (2,4) is body S1, R to (4,4) or something.\n> \n> (4,4) not occupied.\n> \n> But let's not get too deep yet.\n> \n> First, for turn 41, if I move D to (2,2).\n> \n> Move D from (2,3) to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is not wall, not food.\n> \n> After move, no food, so tail moves.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,2), S1 (2,3), S2 (3,3), S3 (4,3), S4 (5,3), S5 (6,3), S6 (6,4), S7 (5,4), S8 (5,5), S9 (4,5) tail. S9 is (4,5), but old S9 (3,5) is gone, new S9 is old S8 position (4,5)? Old positions: after move, head to (2,2), then S1 to old head (2,3), S2 to old S1 (3,3), ..., S8 to old S7 (5,5), S9 to old S8 (4,5). Old S9 (3,5) removed.\n> \n> So positions: head (2,2), S1 (2,3), S2 (3,3), S3 (4,3), S4 (5,3), S5 (6,3), S6 (6,4), S7 (5,4), S8 (5,5), S9 (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is at (3,2), which is adjacent to head? Head at (2,2), (3,2) is right and down?

Borders y=0,7, so (2,1) not border. Internal obstacles: (4,1) is wall, but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (3,2) has food, value 1.\n> \n> So from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2) to eat food, or D to (2,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (3,2), I eat the food, grow, so new head at (3,2), and new segment, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,2), then S1 (2,2), S2 (2,3), S3 (3,3), ..., up to S9 (4,5), and new tail? Since growth, tail stays, so the body has old positions plus new head.\n> \n> After eating, head moves to (3,2), previous head (2,2) becomes S1, so body: S1 (2,2), S2 (2,3), S3 (3,3), S4 (4,3), S5 (5,3), S6 (6,3), S7 (6,4), S8 (5,4), S9 (5,5), and S10 (4,5)? Let's index.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,2), then the previous segments: the first body segment is the old head position (2,2), then old S1 (2,3), old S2 (3,3), old S3 (4,3), old S4 (5,3), old S5 (6,3), old S6 (6,4), old S7 (5,4), old S8 (5,5), old S9 (4,5) is now the 10th segment?

Walls: (4,2) is listed, yes, internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move.\n> \n> (3,1): not wall? y=1, x=3. Internal obstacles: (4,1) is wall, but (3,1) not listed, so free, but y=1, not border yet.\n> \n> Borders y=0,7, so (3,1) is inside.\n> \n> But if I move D to (3,1), or U to (3,3) body, invalid, R to (4,2) wall, so only possible move is D to (3,1).\n> \n> Then from (3,1), I can move down to (3,0) wall, or left to (2,1), or right to (4,1) wall, or up to (3,2) which is body now.\n> \n> (3,2) is head position, but after moving, it will be body.\n> \n> From (3,1), moves: U to (3,2) - which is now occupied by body, since head moved away, (3,2) is part of body, specifically body[0] if we move, but let's see.\n> \n> If I move D from (3,2) to (3,1), then new head (3,1), and body follows: S1 at (3,2), S2 at (2,2), etc.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) - but (3,2) is S1, body, so collision.

It's turn 42. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). That means these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake has 10 segments.

Similarly, (6,4) has life span 5, so it lasts until turn 47.\n> \n> Now, (6,4) is a food position, but looking at the snake positions, (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, it's the 7th segment: positions are [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]. So (6,4) is the body, not the head.\n> \n> The rule says that food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (6,4), since it's under the snake body, I can only eat it if that part moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (3,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Let me list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (4,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (6,3)\n> \n> 6: (6,4)\n> \n> 7: (5,4)\n> \n> 8: (5,5)\n> \n> 9: (4,5) tail\n> \n> Food at (3,2) and (6,4).

Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So (4,2) is an obstacle, which is near (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is not an obstacle, but (4,2) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Head is at (2,4), direction Up. Since it was moving Up, it came from (2,3), so it can't move Down instantly because of no reverse rule. Possible moves: Up, Left, Right? Let's see.\n> \n> Current head position (2,4).

Turn 42: countdown decreases, so after turn 42, life span 2 left; after turn 43, life span 1; after turn 44, gone.

Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,5) is within bounds.\n> \n> After moving to (2,5), snake head at (2,5), body segments: the tail will move, but since no food eaten, length same, so new positions: head (2,5), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, then (2,3), (3,3), ..., but since no growth, the tail (4,5) will be removed? When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0 to 9: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then body: (2,4) [previous head], (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) and tail (4,5) is removed. So snake now from (2,5) to (5,5), 10 segments? Original 10 segments, after move: head new, then 9 body segments from previous, but since tail removed, it should be 9 segments? Let's count.\n> \n> After move: positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) ] but (5,5) was index 8, and index 9 (4,5) is removed. So new snake: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). That's 10 positions? From index 0 to 9, but after move, the body segments are the old positions shifted, but the last one is removed.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when no food, head moves, each segment takes previous position, tail is cut off.\n> \n> So initial segments: 0:head, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9:tail.\n> \n> After move to new head position, new segment 0: new head, segment 1: old segment 0, segment 2: old segment 1, ..., segment 9: old segment 8.

It's turn 43. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So I should list all wall cells to visualize.\n> \n> Wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7.\n> \n> - Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is R, meaning right, so it was moving east.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 2, value +1 (since it's positive, I assume, as value not specified, but from context, value1=1 for positive)\n> \n> The food is given as (x,y, life_span, value). For (3,2,2,1) – value 1, so positive. Similarly, (6,4,4,1) – value 1, positive. (6,5,10,1) – value 1, positive. All food here is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 43, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 44? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after t + L - 1 or something? Example: if at turn t, life_span is N, then after N turns it's gone. Since countdown decreases each turn, including current, at turn t, it has N turns left including turn t. So after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until turn t + N - 1 is the last turn it exists, and it disappears before turn t + N.\n> \n> But for movement, we need to know when it's available.\n> \n> For (3,2): at turn 43, life_span=2, so it will be available on turn 43 and 44, and disappear before turn 45.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life_span=4, available turns 43,44,45,46, disappear before 47.\n> \n> (6,5) life_span=10, available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction R (right).

So allowed: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, move R to (4,4): is (4,4) occupied? Snake positions: (3,4) head, (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (4,4) is not in the list, so not occupied by body. But is it a wall?\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7.

Internal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), etc., not (3,5). Snake: not occupied, so free. But is there food? Food at (3,2), (6,4), (6,5), not (3,5), so no food, just move.\n> \n> - Move D to (3,3): D is y-1, to (3,3). But (3,3) is a body segment! Position 3: (3,3). So if head moves to (3,3), it collides with body, death.

Then snake moves: new head (3,5), body follows, so tail (5,5) moves? After move, positions: head was (3,4), move U to (3,5), so new head (3,5), then body segments: the segment that was at (2,4) moves to previous head position (3,4)?

Let me confirm that.\n> \n> The walls are specified as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So, these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). So the tail is at (6,4). Let me list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  // that's 10 segments?

Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) ]  // head at (5,4), tail at (6,4)\n> \n> If I move head right to (6,4), new head position is (6,4).\n> \n> Then, since I moved to (6,4), which is where the tail was, but now I need to check if food is eaten.\n> \n> (6,4) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> When I eat food, the snake grows: so the head moves to (6,4), and a new segment is added, meaning the tail doesn't move. So the new tail position is still (6,4)? No.\n> \n> After moving, the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, but since head moved to a new position, the body follows.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> But if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the segment before tail becomes the new tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: let S be the list of positions.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, then body: segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, ..., last segment (tail) moves to the position of the second last, so the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> With eating: new head at food position, then body shifts as above, but a new segment is added at the end, so the tail position is the same as before, meaning the old tail position is not vacated; it remains, and a new segment is there.\n> \n> In this case, positions: before move: S = [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] where T is tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position and eating food: new head at new_pos, then B1 moves to old H position, B2 to old B1, ..., T moves to the position of the segment before it, and a new segment is added at the position where T was, so now tail is at old T position.\n> \n> In terms of cells: when food is eaten, the tail cell does not change; it stays occupied, and the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is under the tail, so when I move head to (6,4), which is where tail is, but since tail is there, and I move head there, it might be occupied.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving to tail position is allowed because tail will move.\n> \n> But when I eat food, tail doesn't move; it stays.\n> \n> Let's clarify with the special case.\n> \n> From rules: for food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> For tail specifically: when the tail moves away, the cell is vacated, then head can move in to eat.\n> \n> But in this case, with Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> The Tail Reward Danger says: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, head is at tail position, and new tail is grown there, so head and tail are at same position, collision.\n> \n> That makes sense.\n> \n> In this situation: head at (5,4), tail at (6,4), adjacent. Food at (6,4) on tail.\n> \n> If I move head to (6,4), since it's tail position, it's allowed to move there without immediate collision, but then I eat the food because it's there.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: head is now at (6,4), and a new segment is added, so the tail remains at (6,4)? No.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) ]  // let's index: 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> I move head to (6,4). New head position is (6,4).\n> \n> Now, since I moved to (6,4), which has food, I eat it.\n> \n> Then, the body shifts: segment 1 moves to old head position (5,4), segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,4), ..., segment 9 (tail) moves to old segment 8 position (6,3)?

Where? The new segment is added at the end, so after seg9 moves to (6,3), we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving? Or at the new position?\n> \n> Typically, when food is eaten, the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> But in this case, since the tail was at (6,4), and head moved there, it's messy.\n> \n> Standard way: when you eat food, the segment that was the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added there, so the tail position doesn't change, and the snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of shifting: after head moves to new position, the body segments from 1 to k-1 move to the next position, but the tail segment stays where it is, and a new segment is created at the tail position for the growth.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Let me refer to the rules or common implementation.\n> \n> From the \"Tail Reward Danger\" description: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, after eating, head is at the food cell, and the tail is still there or something.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to tail position which has food, after moving, head is at (6,4), and since food is eaten, the tail does not move; it stays at (6,4), so now both head and tail are at (6,4), causing collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the danger.\n> \n> The rules say: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — meaning that after growth, head and tail are at same cell.\n> \n> So in this situation, if I move to (6,4), I will die immediately because of collision with the tail after eating.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (6,4) while the tail is there and head is adjacent.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the tail to move away first.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 45, head at (5,4), tail at (6,4), adjacent.

turn 47 eats the short-life food at (6,4) before it disappears, scoring another +1, while avoiding immediate death from the corner trap on turn 47 by not moving up to (6,6). This maximizes score (2 points) given the unavoidable dead end in 2 turns due to the snake's position and wall constraints.\n",

Left (L) is opposite to current direction (R) and is not allowed.\n   - Right (R) to (7,5) is invalid (wall at x=7).\n   - So, only possible moves are U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n2. **Food Positions**:\n   - (6,4): Value = +1 (positive food), life_span = 1 (disappears after this turn if not eaten).\n   - (6,6): Value = +1 (positive food), life_span = 9 (longer life).\n\n3. **Consequences of Moves**:\n   - **Move D to (6,4)**:\n     - Eat the food at (6,4), snake grows to length 12.\n     - New head at (6,4), body segments include (6,5), (5,5), etc., tail at (6,3).\n     - Next turn (t=48), possible moves from (6,4):\n       - U to (6,5): Occupied by body (collision).\n       - D to (6,3): Occupied by tail (collision, since tail doesn't move after eating).\n       - L to (5,4): Occupied by body (collision).\n       - R to (7,4): Wall (invalid).\n     - **Result**: No valid moves on turn 48 → death.\n\n   - **Move U to (6,6)**:\n     - Eat the food at (6,6), snake grows to length 12.\n     - New head at (6,6), body segments include (6,5), (5,5), etc., tail at (6,3).\n     - Next turn (t=48), possible moves from (6,6):\n       - U to (6,7): Wall (invalid).\n       - D to (6,5): Occupied by body (collision) and opposite to current direction (U).\n       - L to (5,6): Wall (internal obstacle).\n       - R to (7,6): Wall (invalid).\n     - **Result**: No valid moves on turn 48 → death.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both moves (U and D) lead to unavoidable death on the next turn (t=48).\n   - The food at (6,4) disappears after this turn if not eaten, while the food at (6,6) remains for 9 turns.\n   - Since both moves lead to death, the choice is arbitrary. However, eating the food at (6,4) ensures we don't \"waste\" it (since it disappears after this turn), while the food at (6,6) could theoretically be eaten later (though we can't in this scenario).\n\n### Decision\nGiven that both moves lead to death, the optimal choice is to **move Down (D) to (6,4)** to eat the food that will disappear after this turn. This maximizes the immediate reward since the other food can persist (though it won't matter in this case).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{D}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 47 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(4, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 1), (2, 6), (1, 4), (5, 6), (4, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 4, 1, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 47 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 47. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all walls: borders and these points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving east to (6,5) from previous position.\n> \n> Food: two items. One at (6,4) with value 1 and life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Another at (6,6) with value 1 and life span 9, so it has 9 turns left.\n> \n> Both foods have value 1? Value is given as 1 for both, but one is positive and one negative? The food values: (6,4,1,1) and (6,6,9,1). The format is (x,y, life_span, value)? Let me check the input.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 4, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). So (6,4): life_span=1, value=1; (6,6): life_span=9, value=1. But value=1 means positive food, since positive food gives +1 and length increase, negative gives -1 and no length change. Here both have value=1, so both are positive food? But one has life span 1, other 9.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says positive food: reward +1, length +1; negative food: penalty -1, length unchanged. But in the state, both are listed with value=1, which should mean positive, I think. But let me confirm the format.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but in the list it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? No: it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the state it's written as (6,4,1,1) which might be confusing.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 4, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's a bit messy. Probably (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The core rules say: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be (x,y), value, life_span.\n> \n> But in the state, it's written as (6,4,1,1) which might mean (x,y, life_span, value) or something. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 4, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think \"Life Span and Value\" might be the order, so (x,y, life_span, value). For (6,4), life_span=1, value=1; (6,6), life_span=9, value=1. Value=1 should be positive food since +1 reward.\n> \n> But value=1 is positive, value=-1 would be negative, I assume. Here both are 1, so both positive.\n> \n> Also, for (6,4), life_span=1, meaning it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten on turn 47, it vanishes.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (6,5) moving right. From positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), so it was moving from left to right, from (5,5) to (6,5), so direction R is consistent.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because L would be opposite, which is not allowed. Reverse direction is not instant, so from R, I cannot go L. So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current position: (6,5)\n> \n> - U: (6,5) to (6,6)\n> \n> - D: (6,5) to (6,4)\n> \n> - R: (6,5) to (7,5) but x=7 is border wall, so (7,5) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is border, so R to (7,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> Now, (6,4) has food with life span 1, value 1, positive. (6,6) has food with life span 9, value 1, positive.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake body: let's list positions to understand.\n> \n> Snake: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n> \n> So head at (6,5), tail at (6,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (6,4), that's directly onto the food at (6,4). Since it's food, I eat it, so length increases by one, and I get +1 score. But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> (6,4) is currently occupied by food, not by snake body? Let's see the positions: snake has (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), etc. (5,4) is a body segment, but (6,4) is not in snake positions, it's food. Similarly, (6,6) is food, not snake.\n> \n> If I move to (6,4), I eat the food, so new head position is (6,4), and since I ate, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows to 12 segments. Positions become: head (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) becomes body, so [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), ... down to (6,3)].\n> \n> After moving to a food cell, the head moves to that cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays in place for that turn. So the body extends.\n> \n> Now, is (6,4) safe? After moving, head at (6,4), and body segments: (6,5) is now the first body segment, then (5,5), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> (6,4) was food, now head is there. Is there collision? Head at (6,4), body has (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), etc. (5,4) is at (5,4), which is different, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> But let's see the positions: after move D to (6,4):\n> \n> New positions: head (6,4), then (6,5) [previous head], then (5,5) [which was second, now third? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (6,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (6,4) and eating food: head moves to (6,4), and a new segment is added, so the body grows. The tail does not move; instead, the new tail is the old tail, and segments shift.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, head moves to new cell, and the tail remains, so length increases.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,4), then the previous positions from index 0 to 10 remain, but since we add a segment, the tail stays, so segments: [ (6,4) new head, then (6,5) old head, then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) old tail ] and since we ate, the tail (6,3) stays, so now 12 segments.\n> \n> List: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (6,3)\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (6,4), body segments at (6,5), (5,5), etc. (6,4) is not equal to any body segment except itself, but head is separate. Positions: (6,4) head, (6,5) is adjacent, but not the same cell, so no collision. (5,4) is at (5,4), which is different from (6,4). So safe for now.\n> \n> But after this move, on the next turn, I need to move from there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (6,6), that has food with longer life, but I can eat it now or later.\n> \n> But (6,4) food disappears after this turn, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, moving to (6,6): U to (6,6), eat that food, similar thing.\n> \n> But (6,6) is not wall? x=6, y=6, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,6) is within bounds.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,6) is an obstacle, but (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free, except for the food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) has no obstacle.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,3). Head is at (6,5), not adjacent to tail; (6,5) and (6,3) are two apart, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same row or column, one step away.\n> \n> (6,5) to (6,3) is |dy|=2, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,4), head at (6,4), tail at (6,3), now they are adjacent vertically. And (6,4) has food, but I'm eating it by moving there, so the food is at (6,4), which is where head is moving to.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has positive food, then if I eat that food, it causes collision.\n> \n> Here, after moving to (6,4), head is at (6,4), and tail is at (6,3), which are adjacent.\n> \n> Now, the tail cell is (6,3), does it have food? Currently, food is at (6,4) and (6,6), not at (6,3). (6,3) is part of snake body, it's the tail segment.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> The tail cell means the cell where the tail is located.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,3), and there is no food at (6,3), only at (6,4) and (6,6).\n> \n> So if I move to (6,4), I eat the food at (6,4), which is not the tail cell.

Internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] (head at (6,4), tail at (6,3))\n  - Current direction: Down (D)\n- **Food**:\n  - Only one piece at (6,6) with value +1 and lifespan 8 turns (disappears after Turn 55)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 48\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,4), moving Down (D). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: Move to (6,3)\n   - (6,3) is currently the tail. According to rules, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,4)\n   - (5,4) is occupied by the snake's body (not the tail), so this would cause a collision.\n   \n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,4)\n   - x=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n   \n4. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,5)\n   - (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Also, moving Up is the reverse of the current direction (Down), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid and safe move at Turn 48 is **Down (D)** to (6,3).\n\n### After Moving Down at Turn 48\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,3)\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (6,3)\n  - Body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n  - Tail: (5,3) (since the old tail at (6,3) is now the head)\n- **Direction**: Still Down (D) (assuming direction is updated to the last move)\n  \nNow, let's look at possible moves at Turn 49 from (6,3):\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (6,2)\n   - (6,2) is not occupied by the snake or walls/obstacles. Safe.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is the tail. Safe to move here as the tail will move away.\n   \n3. **Right (R)**: (7,3)\n   - x=7 is a wall. Invalid.\n   \n4. **Up (U)**: (6,4)\n   - (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body. Also, reverse of Down is not allowed.\n\n**Possible Moves at Turn 49**: Down (D) to (6,2) or Left (L) to (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating Moves at Turn 49\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (6,2)**\n- New Head: (6,2)\n- Body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n- Tail: (4,3)\n  \nFrom (6,2), possible next moves (Turn 50):\n- Down to (6,1)\n- Left to (5,2)\n- Up to (6,3) (body, collision)\n  \nThis path seems to lead the snake downward, away from the food at (6,6).\n\n**Option 2: Move Left to (5,3)**\n- New Head: (5,3)\n- Body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n- Tail: (4,3)\n  \nFrom (5,3), possible next moves (Turn 50):\n- Down to (5,2)\n- Left to (4,3) (tail, safe)\n- Up to (5,4) (body, collision)\n  \nThis path moves the snake leftward, potentially opening up more space.\n\n### Deciding on Turn 49 Move\n\nGiven that the food at (6,6) is blocked by the snake's body at (6,5) and (6,4), and it's unlikely to reach it within the remaining lifespan (until Turn 55), the priority is to avoid collisions and survive as long as possible.\n\nMoving Left at Turn 49 seems better as it starts moving the snake away from the crowded right side, potentially giving more room to maneuver in the future.\n\n### Subsequent Moves\n\nAssuming we choose Left at Turn 49 to (5,3):\n\n- **Turn 50**: From (5,3)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,2)\n    - Left to (4,3) (tail, safe)\n  - Choosing Down to (5,2) to explore more space.\n\n- **Turn 51**: From (5,2)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,1)\n    - Left to (4,2) (obstacle)\n    - Right to (6,2)\n  - Choosing Down to (5,1).\n\n- **Turn 52**: From (5,1)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,0) (wall)\n    - Left to (4,1) (obstacle)\n    - Right to (6,1)\n  - Choosing Right to (6,1).\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action for Turn 48 is to move Down (D), as it's the only safe and valid move. The subsequent moves are planned to navigate the snake towards open spaces to avoid collisions, acknowledging that the food at (6,6) is currently unreachable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 48. The grid has walls on the borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). That means these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake is 12 segments long. The head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since y increases upwards? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), which probably means y increases upwards, so U is up, D is down (y decreases). L is left (x decreases), R is right (x increases).\n> \n> Head direction is D, so currently moving down.\n> \n> Food: only one food item mentioned: (6,6) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including the current turn, so it will be gone by turn 48 + 8 - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 48, life span is 8. After turn 48, it becomes 7, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears. So it will be present for turns 48 to 55 (since 48 + 7 = 55, and on turn 56 it would be gone). Turn 48: life=8, turn 49: life=7, ..., turn 55: life=1, turn 56: life=0, gone. So it can be eaten from turn 48 to 55 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, but indices from 0 to 7 inclusive, so cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). Let's list them:\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> Head is at (6,4), moving down (D), so if it continues down, next position would be (6,3), but (6,3) is the tail? Let's see the positions: the last segment is (6,3), which is the tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might become empty unless it's occupied by something else.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves down to (6,3), but (6,3) is currently occupied by the tail. But according to the rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so no collision, as long as it's not a body segment that doesn't move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to (6,3) is possible and safe, because after move, tail moves, so (6,3) becomes empty or something.\n> \n> But let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions: indices from head to tail: 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (6,3)\n> \n> If head moves down to (6,3), which is current tail position. After move, new head is (6,3), and the tail segment is removed? No, when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to adjacent cell, each body segment follows to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (6,3), which is currently occupied by the tail, but since tail moves away (it disappears), the cell is free, so no collision.\n> \n> Then new snake: head (6,3), then body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Previous tail (6,3) is now head, and the segment that was at (6,4) is now at position 1, and so on, down to (5,3) which was position 10, now 11?

No: snake had 12 segments initially. After move, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so snake has same length, 12 segments but positions shifted.\n> \n> Initial: 12 positions.\n> \n> After move: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the last segment (tail) is discarded. So new snake has same length, positions from head to tail: new head, then previous head, then previous body1, ..., previous body10, and previous tail is gone.\n> \n> In list: positions indexed 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move down to (6,3):\n> \n> - New position 0: (6,3)  // new head\n> \n> - Position 1: (6,4)  // previous position 0\n> \n> - Position 2: (6,5)  // previous position 1\n> \n> - Position 3: (5,5)  // previous position 2\n> \n> - Position 4: (5,4)  // previous position 3\n> \n> - Position 5: (4,4)  // previous position 4\n> \n> - Position 6: (3,4)  // previous position 5\n> \n> - Position 7: (2,4)  // previous position 6\n> \n> - Position 8: (2,3)  // previous position 7\n> \n> - Position 9: (3,3)  // previous position 8\n> \n> - Position 10: (4,3)  // previous position 9\n> \n> - Position 11: (5,3)  // previous position 10\n> \n> Previous position 11 (6,3) is now head, so it's not in body. Body segments are positions 1 to 11, but position 1 is (6,4), which was head, now body.\n> \n> The cell (6,3) was occupied by tail, but after move, it's head, and the tail was removed, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, back to current state.

Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move Left to (5,3), but (5,3) is current tail.

Since it's the tail, and we're moving, the tail will be removed, so head can move there.\n> \n> New head position: (5,3)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1 moves to old head (6,3), segment 2 moves to old seg1 (6,4), and so on, up to segment 11 moves to old seg10 (4,3), and the tail old seg11 (5,3) is left, but since head moved to (5,3), it's eaten? No, there's no food at (5,3), so just movement.\n> \n> New snake: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — and the last segment (5,3) is gone, so tail is (4,3), and snake is now 11 segments? No, when you move without eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves away.\n> \n> Original snake has 12 segments. When you move to a free cell, the tail is removed, so the snake has the same length, head moves, tail is cut off.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,3) which is currently occupied by tail, but since it's the tail, and we're moving, it's allowed, and after move, the cell is free, but no food eaten, so length unchanged, tail moves.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,3), then the body: the first body segment is at old head position (6,3), then old seg1 (6,4), old seg2 (6,5), old seg3 (5,5), old seg4 (5,4), old seg5 (4,4), old seg6 (3,4), old seg7 (2,4), old seg8 (2,3), old seg9 (3,3), old seg10 (4,3), and old seg11 (5,3) is not part of snake anymore, so new tail is (4,3).\n> \n> List: new segment 0: (5,3) head, seg1: (6,3), seg2: (6,4), seg3: (6,5), seg4: (5,5), seg5: (5,4), seg6: (4,4), seg7: (3,4), seg8: (2,4), seg9: (2,3), seg10: (3,3), seg11: (4,3) tail. So 12 segments, but positions shifted; the tail moved from (5,3) to (4,3), but (4,3) was already a body segment? No, old seg10 was (4,3), now it's seg11, tail.\n> \n> (4,3) is now tail, previously it was part of body.\n> \n> But in terms of cells, (5,3) is now head, and (4,3) is tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (6,2), new head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc., tail (5,3) gone, new tail (4,3) or something.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> From (6,3), possible actions:\n> \n> - Down to (6,2)\n> \n> - Left to (5,3)\n> \n> Right is invalid, Up invalid.\n> \n> So only two choices: Down or Left.\n> \n> If I go Down to (6,2), I'm at (6,2), which is closer to (5,2) food? (5,2) is at (5,2), so from (6,2), I can go Left to (5,2) to eat the food, but need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> (5,2) is food, so if I move to (5,2), I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But first, from (6,3), if I go Down to (6,2), turn 49.\n> \n> Then at (6,2), I can go Left to (5,2) on turn 50.\n> \n> (5,2) is food, so I eat it, length increases.\n> \n> But is (5,2) safe? Walls: (5,2) is not a wall, not border, not in internal walls list. Internal walls: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2) — (1,2) is there, but (5,2) not, so no wall.\n> \n> Snake: after moving to (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — but when I moved to (6,2), the tail (5,3) is removed, so snake is head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — 12 segments, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Now at (6,2), I can move to (5,2). (5,2) is not occupied by snake now, since snake has (6,2), (6,3), etc., (5,2) is free except for the food.\n> \n> So moving to (5,2) should be fine, and I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (5,2), then body (6,2), (6,3), ..., and the tail stays, so length 13.\n> \n> But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 50, if I move to (5,2), where is the tail?\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) on turn 49, tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), (5,2) is at (5,2), which is adjacent? (4,3) and (5,2) are not adjacent; (4,3) to (5,2) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, one cell away.\n> \n> So (4,3) and (5,2): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not adjacent cells. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (4,3), adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3).\n> \n> (5,2) is not adjacent to (4,3); (5,2) is down-left of (4,3), but not sharing a side.\n> \n> So no adjacency, so eating (5,2) should be safe.\n> \n> Then after eating, snake grows, head at (5,2), body includes (6,2), (6,3), etc., tail is (4,3) still, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added, tail remains (4,3) for now? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> After moving to food cell, the head is there, and the tail doesn't advance, so the new tail is the old tail, but the body is longer.\n> \n> In sequence: after eating, positions: head at food cell, then previous head, then body, and tail unchanged.\n> \n> So from above: after moving to (6,2) at turn 49, snake: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> Then at turn 50, move to (5,2), which is food, so eat: new head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — and since I ate, the tail (4,3) stays, so snake now has 13 segments, with tail at (4,3).\n> \n> No immediate collision.\n> \n> But what about the other food at (6,6)? It has only 7 turns left, so I need to get there soon if I want it.\n> \n> After eating (5,2), I'm at (5,2), and I need to go to (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) is up-right.\n> \n> Also, there are internal walls that might block the path.\n> \n> Another option: from (6,3), instead of going down, I could go left to (5,3).\n> \n> If I go left to (5,3) at turn 49.\n> \n> As before, new head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> Now at (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) — but (5,4) is body, occupied, invalid?

Internal obstacles: (4,1) is obstacle, but (6,1) not listed, so should be free? Obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).

But there is food there, but food can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> - Right (R): (7,2) – x=7 is border wall, so (7,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is border, so (7,2) is invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - U: (6,3) – occupied by snake body, so collision, death.

internal obstacles - 12 snake - 2 food = 64-28-8-12-2= let's calculate: 28+8=36, 36+12=48, 48+2=50, 64-50=14 free cells.\n> \n> But after eating food, one food cell is removed, and snake grows, so number of free cells decreases.\n> \n> But with 14 free cells, the snake can move around.\n> \n> The area near (2,3) to (3,3) to (2,4) etc. has some space.\n> \n> For example, cells like (1,3), (1,1), but (1,2) and (1,4) are obstacles, so (1,3) might be free.\n> \n> (1,3) not obstacle, not wall (y=0 and y=7 walls, x=0 wall, but (1,3) is not x=0, so free if not occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,5), etc.\n> \n> But with internal obstacles, it's fragmented.\n> \n> For example, the left part: x from 1 to 3, y from 1 to 5, but with obstacles (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6) but y=6, etc.\n> \n> Perhaps I should move towards the left where there is more space.\n> \n> For instance, from current position, if I go to (5,2) or to (6,1), both lead to moving left.\n> \n> But since

only from food, so I need to eat when possible.\n> \n> But if I don't eat, I can move to more places with shorter snake.\n> \n> For example, at turn 50, if I move D to (6,1), no eat, then at turn 51, move L to (5,1), no eat, then at turn 52, I can move U to (5,2) to eat, or I could move to another cell, but from (5,1), only U to (5,2) is possible, since L to (4,1) obstacle, D to (5,0) wall, R to (6,1) occupied or reverse.\n> \n> So I have to move U to (5,2) at turn 52.\n> \n> So I must eat it at turn 52 if I didn't at 50.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat at 50, I must move to (5,3) at turn 51.\n> \n> So the only difference is at turn 50 and 51.\n> \n> If I eat at turn 50, turn 50 action L, turn 51 action U to (5,3)\n> \n> If I don't eat, turn 50 action D to (6,1), turn 51 action L to (5,1), turn 52 action U to (5,2) eat.\n> \n> Then after that, both paths converge to the same: turn 53 U to (5,3), turn 54 L to (4,3), etc.\n> \n> But in the first case, when I eat at turn 50, at turn 51 I move to (5,3), while in the second case, at turn 51 I move to (5,1), then to (5,2) at 52.\n> \n> But after turn 52, both have head at (5,2) or (5,3), but with different body positions.\n> \n> When I eat at turn 50, at turn 51 I'm at (5,3) with body including (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n> \n> When I eat at turn 52, at turn 51 I'm at (5,1) with body (6,1), (6,2), etc.\n> \n> At turn 52, after eating, both have head at (5,2), but the body is different.\n> \n> In first case (eat at 50): at turn 52, after moving to (5,3) at turn 51, then at turn 52 move to (4,3), so head at (4,3), body as before.\n> \n> In second case (eat at 52): at turn 52, after moving to (5,2), head at (5,2), body as after eating.\n> \n> But for the future, it might not matter much.\n> \n> To reach other areas, but there is no other food, so I need to survive.\n> \n> Perhaps I can head towards the left where there are free cells.\n> \n> For example, from (4,3), I can go to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (2,2), then to (2,1) or (1,1), but (1,2) obstacle, so (1,1) might be free, etc.\n> \n> But with walls, it might be a dead end.\n> \n> For instance, (2,1) can go to (2,0) wall, or (1,1), or (3,1).\n> \n> (1,1) can go to (1,0) wall, or (1,2) obstacle, or (2,1), so limited.\n> \n> Similarly, the area is small.\n> \n> Perhaps I should not eat the food to keep the snake shorter for longer, but since the food is positive, eating it increases score and length, but in this case, only one food, so I have to eat it eventually to score, and not eating means I miss the point.\n> \n> But if I don't eat, the food will disappear after life span, but life span 9, long, so I can eat it later.\n> \n> But in this case, from the position, I am forced to eat it soon, as above.\n> \n> If at turn 50 I move D to (6,1), turn 51 L to (5,1), at turn 51, from (5,1), I must move U to (5,2) at turn 52, so I have to eat it.\n> \n> No choice.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L at turn 50, I eat immediately.\n> \n> So for the action sequence, I can choose either, but since the goal is to maximize score, and both result in eating the food, I should eat it now to have the point earlier.\n> \n> Moreover, for long-term, it

It's turn 51, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since x and y go from 0 to 7, so 8 cells in each direction). The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Additionally, there are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,2), and the body segments follow: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). Let me plot this mentally.\n> \n> Head direction is Left (L), so the snake was moving left to (5,2) from (6,2), I assume. Positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), which is to the right, so yes, moving left to (5,2).\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 51, it has 5 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 55 or something? Life span 5 at turn 51: on turn 51, it has life span 5; after turn 51, it will have life span 4, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 51 to 55, and disappears on turn 56.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a mental map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (5,2), direction L.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, and we're at (5,2), possible moves from here: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since direction is L, we cannot move R (right) next, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so we cannot move R on this turn. Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells by snake and obstacles.\n> \n> Snake body: from head (5,2) to tail (4,3). Positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) - head\n> \n> - (6,2)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (4,3) - tail\n> \n> Also obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is an obstacle, but (4,2) is also listed in snake positions? Snake has (4,3), (3,3), (4,4), etc., but (4,2) is an obstacle, not part of snake. Let me check.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So (4,2) is not in snake; it's an obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) obstacle, etc.\n> \n> Food at (6,6).\n> \n> Now, from head position (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,3) - is this free?\n> \n> (5,3) is not in snake positions. Snake positions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), etc. (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free? But let's list all snake y-coordinates.\n> \n> x=5: (5,2), (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is there, but (5,3) is not mentioned. Similarly, x=4: (4,4), (4,3) — (4,3) is tail, but not (4,2) or (4,1) except obstacles.\n> \n> (5,3): not in snake positions, not an obstacle. Obstacles include (4,2), (4,1), etc., but (5,3) is clear.\n> \n> Similarly, Down (D): (5,1) — y=1, is it wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall. Obstacles: (4,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) is not listed as obstacle. Internal obstacles are specific points, not whole rows. So (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> Left (L): (4,2) — but (4,2) is an obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (4,2), so (4,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Right (R): (6,2) — but (6,2) is the first body segment. Moving to (6,2) would cause collision because the snake body is there, except if it's the tail, but it's not; (6,2) is the second segment, and when we move, the tail moves, so let's think.\n> \n> Movement: if I move to a cell that is occupied by the body, it's deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard Snake rule: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by the body except the tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away at the same time, it's ok because the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,2), moving right to (6,2): (6,2) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, head moves to (6,2), and the tail moves from (4,3) to wherever, but since the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,2) will move to the next position, but when head moves to (6,2), at that moment, if (6,2) was occupied by body, it could collide.\n> \n> I need to clarify the collision rule.\n> \n> From the problem: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that is the tail is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,3), so (4,3) is safe to move to only if we are moving to it and it's the tail.\n> \n> But from (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,3)\n> \n> - D: to (5,1)\n> \n> - L: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is an obstacle, so wall collision or obstacle, deadly.\n> \n> - R: to (6,2) — (6,2) is occupied by the second segment of the snake, which is not the tail. The tail is at (4,3). So moving to (6,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,2), with head direction L, possible moves are only U and D, because L is obstacle and R is body collision (not tail).\n> \n> Confirming:\n> \n> - (5,3): not occupied by snake or obstacle? Snake positions: (5,2), (5,4), (5,5) — no (5,3). Obstacles: none at (5,3). So (5,3) is free.\n> \n> - (5,1): not occupied, no obstacle. y=1 is not wall, x=5 not wall.\n> \n> - (4,2): obstacle, so deadly.\n> \n> - (6,2): occupied by snake body (second segment), not tail, so collision if head moves there.\n> \n> Therefore, only U and D are safe moves.\n> \n> Now, since we must think 5+ turns ahead, I need to plan a sequence of actions.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,6) with value +1, life span 5, so it can be eaten until turn 55.\n> \n> Current turn 51, so we have 5 turns to eat it: turns 51 to 55 inclusive? Life span decreases each turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn 51, food has life span 5. After turn 51, it will have 4, and so on. It disappears when life span reaches 0, so after 5 turns, on turn 56, it should be gone. So it can be eaten on turns 51,52,53,54,55.\n> \n> Now, (6,6) is the food position. Where is the head? (5,2). So it's far away; we need to move towards it.\n> \n> But we have to avoid obstacles and plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up or down from (5,2).\n> \n> If I move U to (5,3), then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> Or D to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I should also think about the tail and possible food under body, but in this case, no food under body mentioned, only (6,6) is food, which is not under snake.\n> \n> Food at (6,6), snake is not on it, so no issue.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But currently, tail is at (4,3), and head at (5,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,2) and (4,3) are diagonally adjacent? No, adjacent usually means up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (5,2) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: for (5,2), adjacent are (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2). (4,3) is not directly adjacent; it's one step away diagonally or something. Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent if we consider only cardinal directions.\n> \n> In grid terms, adjacent means sharing a side, so for (5,2), adjacent cells are (5,3) north, (5,1) south, (4,2) west, (6,2) east. (4,3) is northwest, not adjacent.\n> \n> So tail at (4,3) is not adjacent to head (5,2). Therefore, no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (5,2), safe moves: U to (5,3) or D to (5,1).\n> \n> I need to get to (6,6) to eat the food.\n> \n> (6,6) is at top-right, head at bottom-left, roughly. (5,2) is x=5,y=2; (6,6) is x=6,y=6.\n> \n> But there are obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,6) is obstacle, which is near (6,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is food, but (5,6) is obstacle, so we cannot go through (5,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) obstacle, etc.\n> \n> Now, snake body occupies many cells, but as we move, the snake moves, so the body positions change.\n> \n> To reach (6,6), we need a path.\n> \n> First, from (5,2), if we go U to (5,3), then from (5,3), possible moves.\n> \n> (5,3) is free, as we said.\n> \n> From (5,3), we can go U to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by snake! Snake has (5,4) as a body segment.\n> \n> Positions: (5,4) is the 7th segment?

So the tail leaves its position.\n> \n> For example, if we move head to (5,3), then new positions: head at (5,3), S1 moves to old head (5,2), S2 moves to old S1 (6,2), and so on, up to S12 moves to old S11 (3,3), so tail is now at (3,3), and (4,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move down to (5,1), head to (5,1), S1 to (5,2), etc., tail to (3,3).\n> \n> But let's focus on reaching (6,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), and we have obstacles at (5,6) and (4,6), so to reach (6,6), we need to approach from left, right, or below, but above y=6 is wall? y=7 is wall, so from below or sides.\n> \n> x=6, y=6; x=7 is wall, so cannot from right. y=7 wall, cannot from above.

Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So, let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But since it's a border, it's the edges.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,4) is listed, and (1,5), etc.\n> \n> Snake positions: from head to tail: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction U, so it just moved up to (5,3) from (5,2)? Positions are head first: (5,3) is head, then (5,2) is the next segment, which would be the neck. Since head direction is U, it came from below, so from (5,2) to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head is at (5,3) and direction is U, I can move U, L, or R. Cannot move D because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so opposite is D, which is not allowed. So possible actions: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (5,3):\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) - but (5,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,3) head, then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), ... (5,4) is the 8th segment? Let's index them:\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,2)\n> \n> 2: (6,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,4)\n> \n> 5: (6,5)\n> \n> 6: (5,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,4)  <--- (5,4) is position 7\n> \n> 8: (4,4)\n> \n> 9: (3,4)\n> \n> 10: (2,4)\n> \n> 11: (2,3)\n> \n> 12: (3,3) tail\n> \n> So (5,4) is occupied by the snake body at index 7. Similarly, other positions.\n> \n> Now, cells adjacent to head (5,3):\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) - occupied by snake body, so if I move there, collision with body, death.\n> \n> - Down: (5,2) - but (5,2) is occupied by the next segment, index 1. Also, moving down would be reverse direction, but since current direction is U, moving D is opposite, which is not allowed anyway. So invalid move.\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) - what is here? Not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: borders and internal. (4,3) is not listed as wall. Borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,3) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (4,1), (4,2), (4,6) — (4,2) is wall, but (4,3) is not listed, so should be free? Let's confirm walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So (4,2) is wall, but (4,3) is not mentioned, so it should be empty.\n> \n> - Right: (6,3) - (6,3) is occupied by snake body, index 3.\n> \n> (6,3) is part of snake, index 3.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) - occupied, collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: opposite direction, invalid\n> \n> - L: (4,3) - appears free? But is it safe?\n> \n> - R: (6,3) - occupied, collision, invalid\n> \n> Only left to (4,3) seems possible? But let's double-check.\n> \n> (4,3): not in snake positions, not in walls. Walls: borders are edges, internal at (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), so (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> But moving left to (4,3) is possible, but I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Also, food locations: (6,6) and (4,5)\n> \n> (6,6): value 1, life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 52, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 55? Let's clarify life-span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns where countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown starts at life_span, decreases each turn.\n> \n> For food at (6,6), life_span=4 at turn 52, so:\n> \n> - Turn 52: countdown=4\n> \n> - Turn 53: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 54: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 55: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 56: countdown=0, disappears? Or after N turns, meaning after turn 52 + 4 = turn 56 it disappears, so available until turn 55 inclusive? I think it's better to think: it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown = L, then after one turn, at t+1, countdown = L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Typically, it can be eaten on turns where countdown >0, and disappears before the next turn when countdown=0.\n> \n> But to be precise, since it says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is life_span.\n> \n> For (6,6) at turn 52, life_span=4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning after turn 55, so during turn 56 it is gone. So available to eat on turns 52,53,54,55.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life_span=10, so available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, back to current position. Head at (5,3), only possible move seems to be left to (4,3), because up and right are occupied, down is invalid.\n> \n> But is (4,3) safe? Let's see what happens after moving.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,3) on turn 52.\n> \n> Then snake head moves to (4,3), and since it eats no food (no food at (4,3)), length unchanged, tail moves away from (3,3), so new positions: head at (4,3), then the body: previous head (5,3) becomes new neck, then (5,2), (6,2), etc., but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so tail (3,3) is gone, and the new tail is (2,3) or something.\n> \n> Snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,3):\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> New position 1: (5,3)  // previous head\n> \n> Position 2: (5,2)  // previous position 1\n> \n> Position 3: (6,2)  // previous position 2\n> \n> Position 4: (6,3)  // previous position 3\n> \n> Position 5: (6,4)  // previous position 4\n> \n> Position 6: (6,5)  // previous position 5\n> \n> Position 7: (5,5)  // previous position 6\n> \n> Position 8: (5,4)  // previous position 7\n> \n> Position 9: (4,4)  // previous position 8\n> \n> Position 10: (3,4)  // previous position 9\n> \n> Position 11: (2,4)  // previous position 10\n> \n> Position 12: (2,3)  // previous position 11, but since no food, tail is removed, so positions from 0 to 12, but index 12 is removed? Let's list all segments.\n> \n> Original: 13 segments, indices 0 to 12.\n> \n> After move with no food: head moves to new cell, new segment 0 is (4,3), then segment 1 is old segment 0: (5,3), segment 2 is old segment 1: (5,2), ..., up to segment 12 is old segment 11: (2,4)? Old segments: 0:(5,3), 1:(5,2), 2:(6,2), 3:(6,3), 4:(6,4), 5:(6,5), 6:(5,5), 7:(5,4), 8:(4,4), 9:(3,4), 10:(2,4), 11:(2,3), 12:(3,3)\n> \n> After move to (4,3) no food:\n> \n> New segment 0: (4,3)  // new head\n> \n> New segment 1: old 0 = (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 2: old 1 = (5,2)\n> \n> New segment 3: old 2 = (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 4: old 3 = (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 5: old 4 = (6,4)\n> \n> New segment 6: old 5 = (6,5)\n> \n> New segment 7: old 6 = (5,5)\n> \n> New segment 8: old 7 = (5,4)\n> \n> New segment 9: old 8 = (4,4)\n> \n> New segment 10: old 9 = (3,4)\n> \n> New segment 11: old 10 = (2,4)\n> \n> New segment 12: old 11 = (2,3)  // but since no food eaten, we remove the tail, so only segments 0 to 11, 12 segments. Old segment 12 (3,3) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]  // 12 segments, tail at (2,4)\n> \n> Head at (4,3), direction was U, but now after moving left, the new head direction is L (left).\n> \n> Now, at this point, turn 52 done.\n> \n> But I need to plan sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,6) and (4,5) are still there.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is currently occupied by snake body? In the new positions, (4,4) is segment 9, (3,4) segment 10, etc. (4,5) is not in snake positions now, and not a wall.\n> \n> Walls: (4,5) is not a wall, internal walls are at (4,6), etc., so (4,5) is free.\n> \n> (6,6) is also free.\n> \n> Now, for turn 53, head at (4,3), direction L (since just moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (4,3), with direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> Possible: L, U, D.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) - what is here?

New positions: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) — so (3,3) is not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> - U: (4,4) - but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, segment 9 in new list?

Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). No (3,3), so yes, (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,3). Is that right?\n> \n> What about U? U is (x,y+1) = (4,4), which is occupied by snake body, segment at index 9, which is not tail, so if head moves there, it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,2) is wall.\n> \n> R to (5,3) is body.\n> \n> So yes, only L to (3,3) is safe.\n> \n> But the snake has to move, so I must choose L.\n> \n> But let's think about the direction.

The snake moves, so head goes to (3,3), and the tail moves, so the segment at (2,3) is removed, but since it's moving, the new tail depends.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: head to new position, then each segment moves to previous position, so the tail at (2,3) is removed, and new positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]?

Snake has (4,4) and (3,4), etc., but (4,5) is not listed in snake positions. Positions: (6,5) is there, (5,5), but not (4,5). (4,5) should be free? But is it a wall? Walls: internal (4,6), but (4,5) not listed as wall, so free.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (4,5) is above (4,4), which is a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is above (6,5), which is body segment.\n> \n> Rule for food under body: it can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, for (4,5), it's not under snake? Snake has segments at (4,4), which is below (4,5), but (4,5) is not occupied by snake, so it's free food, not under body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is not occupied, since snake has (6,5) but not (6,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is segment, (6,6) is above, so free.\n> \n> Only if food spawns under body, but here both foods are on free cells.\n> \n> So I can eat them by moving head there.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, at turn 53, I must move L to (3,3), as only choice.\n> \n> Then, from (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Now possible moves: from (3,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n> \n> But R is opposite to current direction L?

After move, snake has (3,4) as part 11? New positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> So (3,4) is the 12th segment, which is not tail; tail is (2,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,4), it's a body segment, collision.\n> \n> - D to (3,2): (3,2) not wall? Walls: internal (4,2), (1,2), etc. (3,2) not listed, borders y=0, but y=2>0, x=3 between 1-6, so should be free. Is it occupied? Not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): (2,3) is not in new snake positions? Snake has (2,4) as tail. (2,3) is free? But earlier tail was at (2,3), but after move, tail is at (2,4), so (2,3) is free? Let's see: positions after turn 53 move: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> So cells occupied: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> (2,3) is not occupied, and not wall. Walls: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6), etc. No (2,3), so free.\n> \n> But (2,3) might be close to tail.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,3), head at (2,3), and tail is at (2,4), but when I move, tail moves away, so it should be safe to move to where tail was? Rule: I can move to tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> But here, moving to (2,3), which is not currently occupied; tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> (2,3) is free cell, so moving there is fine, no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,2) is free.\n> \n> But U to (3,4) is occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> So from (3,3), turn 54, possible moves: D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> (6,6) must be eaten soon, by turn 55.\n> \n> (4,5) has more time.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (2,4), and head at (3,3), so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, to reach (6,6), which is at (6,6), I need to go there.\n> \n> But currently, the area around (6,6) has obstacles and snake body.\n> \n> (6,6) is a cell, walls: (4,6), (5,6) are walls, so (6,6) is not wall? (6,6) x=6,y=6, borders: x=7 and y=7 are walls, but (6,6) is within 1-6, so not border wall. Internal walls: (4,6), (5,6), but (6,6) not listed, so it should be free, but let's see the list: internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (6,6) not there, so yes, free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,6), I need to get to (6,6) by turn 55.\n> \n> Turn 53: I move to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 54: from (3,3), I can move to (3,2) or (2,3)\n> \n> If I go to (3,2), then from there, possible moves, etc.\n> \n> But (6,6) is far, at (6,6), head at (3,3) after turn 53.\n> \n> Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |6-3| = 3+3=6, so at least 6 moves away, but with obstacles, might be more.\n> \n> Turn 53 to 55 is 3 turns: turn 53,54,55 I can eat.\n> \n> At turn 53, head was at (4,3), moved to (3,3), not eating food.\n> \n> Turn 54: head at (3,3), if I move, I can't reach (6,6) in one move, too far.\n> \n> After turn 54, head at say (3,2) or (2,3), then turn 55, I can move, but from (3,2) to (6,6) is |6-3| + |6-2| =3+4=7, too far; from (2,3) to (6,6) is 4+3=7, also far. So impossible to reach (6,6) by turn 55, since at best after turn 54, head is at (3,2) or (2,3), both at distance at least 5 from (6,6), and turn 55 is only one move, so I can only move to adjacent cells, like (4,2) but (4,2) is wall, or (3,3) but occupied, etc. From (3,2), possible moves to (3,3), (2,2), (4,2) but (4,2) wall, (3,3) might be body, etc., not closer to (6,6). Similarly from (2,3), to (2,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), all not closer.\n> \n> (2,4) is tail, which might be safe, but (2,4) to (6,6) is far.\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat (6,6) by turn 55, because I can't reach it in time from the current position after turn 53 move.\n> \n> At turn 53, head at (4,3), if I could move directly, but I can only move to (3,3), not closer to (6,6).\n> \n> (4,3) to (6,6) is |6-4| + |6-3| =2+3=5, so 5 moves away, but I have turns 53,54,55: three moves, but I need to start from turn 53.\n> \n> Turn 53: from (4,3) I move to (3,3), now at turn 54 head at (3,3), distance to (6,6) is 3+3=6.\n> \n> Then turn 54: I move, say, to (3,2) or (2,3), distance still about 5 or 6.\n> \n> Then turn 55: from there, only one move, can't reach (6,6).\n> \n> So indeed, impossible to eat (6,6) since it disappears after turn 55, and I can't be there on turn 55 or before.\n> \n> Turn 55 is the last chance, but I can't reach it.\n> \n> Therefore, I should forget about (6,6) and focus on (4,5) and survival.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is closer.\n> \n> At turn 53, head at (4,3), after move to (3,3), distance to (4,5) is |4-3| + |5-3| =1+2=3.\n> \n> But I need to eat it by turn 61, plenty of time.\n> \n> But I should plan a path to eat it safely.\n> \n> First, at turn 53, I must move L to (3,3).\n> \n> Now turn 54, from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> I need to go to (4,5), which is north-east from (3,3).\n> \n> (4,5) is at x=4,y=5.\n> \n> From (3,3), moving U to (3,4) is not possible because it's occupied by body.\n> \n> Moving D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), then from there, I can move to, say, (4,2) but (4,2) is wall, or (3,1) but y=0 is wall, or (3,3) but occupied, or (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) might be free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (2,3), then from there, I can move to (2,4), but (2,4) is tail, or (1,3), or (2,2), or (3,3).\n> \n> But (1,3): x=1,y=3, not border? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 ok, but internal walls: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are walls, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (1,2) is wall, (1,4) wall, (1,5) wall, so (1,3) might be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) not wall.\n> \n> But let's think about the tail.\n> \n> Current tail after turn 53 is at (2,4).\n> \n> When I move, tail moves, so the snake is shortening or staying, but no food eaten, so length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> To eat (4,5), I need to get head to (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is currently free, but above (4,4) which is body.\n> \n> After a few moves, it might be accessible.\n> \n> Since I have to move from (3,3) at turn 54.\n> \n> Option 1: move D to (3,2)\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Then turn 55, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is now body?

But head direction is L, left, so if head moved left to (3,3), previous position was (4,3)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> So positions are listed from head to tail.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 54, it has life span 2, so it will disappear at the end of turn 55? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

After turn 54, it becomes life span 1. After turn 55, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 54 or 55, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 8, so it will last until turn 54+8-1? After turn 54, life span 7, then 6, ..., down to 0 after turn 61, disappears at turn 62 or something. But since we eat on a turn, as long as life span >0 when we move onto it.\n> \n> To eat on turn T, the food must have life span at least 1 at the start of T, I think. When we move, we eat if we land on food with positive life span.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases every turn, including when we move? The rules don't specify, but I think the sequence is: at the beginning of turn, update food life spans (decrease countdown), then snake moves, and if it moves onto food, it eats it.\n> \n> The rules: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't say when.\n> \n> To be safe, assume that at the start of each turn, before movement, food life spans decrease by 1 for that turn.\n> \n> Then, after movement, if head moves to a food cell, it eats it if life span >0.\n> \n> For (6,6): at start of turn 54, life span 2. After decrease, it becomes 1? Or decrease happens after movement?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the end of the turn, countdown decreases, so for eating, on turn t, the food has the current life span as given.\n> \n> For example, at turn 54, (6,6) has life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 54 or 55. After eaten or after turn 55, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5), life span 8, can be eaten from turn 54 to 61.\n> \n> Now, back to snake movement.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right.

But (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,3) is not mentioned, so it should be empty unless snake body is there.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all snake segments to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)\n> \n> So (1,3) is not occupied by snake or obstacle, so moving left to (1,3) should be possible.\n> \n> Up from (2,3): (2,4) — y+1 is up? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so from (2,3), U to (2,4)\n> \n> (2,4): is it free? Check obstacles: borders y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, so y=4 is not border. Internal obstacles: (2,6) is obstacle, but (2,4) not listed. Snake positions: (3,4) and (4,4) etc., but (2,4) is not in snake list. Snake has (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) — (3,4) is there, but (2,4) is not, so free.\n> \n> Down from (2,3): D to (2,2) — (x,y-1)\n> \n> (2,2): y=2, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) but that's (1,2), not (2,2). (2,2) not in obstacles. Snake: positions include (5,2), (6,2), but not (2,2), so free? (2,2) should be empty.\n> \n> But there is an obstacle at (1,2), which is adjacent but not (2,2).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,6) with life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.

Not possible; it's 4 units away in x and 3 in y, so minimum 7 moves away, but since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so impossible to eat. So (6,6) is not reachable and will be gone after turn 55.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is at x=4,y=5, life span 7, so available for 7 turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t+N-1? Let's see.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 55, life span 1 for (6,6), so after turn 55, it disappears. Meaning, if head is on (6,6) at turn 55, it can be eaten, but since head is at (2,3), not possible. So (6,6) is gone.\n> \n> For (4,5), life span 7 at turn 55, so it will disappear after turn 55+7-1 = turn 61?

But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N more turns, including the current one if eaten now.\n> \n> But for eating, the head must be on the food cell on that turn.\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 55, life span 1: if head is on (6,6) on turn 55, it can be eaten; after turn 55, it disappears, so not available on turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,5), life span 7 at turn 55: it can be eaten from turn 55 to turn 61? Turn t to t + life_span - 1.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., at turn t + (N-1), countdown 1, at turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten only on turns when countdown >=1, i.e., from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (4,5): N=7 at turn 55, so can be eaten from turn 55 to turn 55+6 = turn 61.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): N=10, can be eaten from turn 55 to turn 64.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (2,3) at turn 55.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions: L, U, D.\n> \n> - L to (1,3)\n> \n> - U to (2,4)\n> \n> - D to (2,2)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (1,3): as above, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body. Snake body: positions are given, (1,3) not in list. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — (1,3) is between y=2 and y=4, so should be free. But is there a wall? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so no. So (1,3) is free.\n> \n> (2,4): not border, not obstacle (obstacles at (2,6) but not (2,4)), not snake body (snake has (3,4) but not (2,4)), so free.\n> \n> (2,2): not border, not obstacle ( (1,2) is obstacle but (2,2) is different), not snake body, so free.\n> \n> All three moves seem possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns. Also, consider food positions.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is above the snake's body? Snake segments: let's see what's at (4,5). Snake positions: (5,5) is there, (6,5), but (4,5) not listed, so not occupied. Food is at (4,5), so it's present.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), which might be near obstacles.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 13 segments. After eating food, length increases by 1 for positive food.\n> \n> But also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: head (2,3), then body, tail is last: (3,4) is the tail? Positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] so tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Next, when snake moves, the tail moves, so on next turn, if no food eaten, tail moves from (3,4) to where? Depends on movement.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 55, tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Is there food at tail? Food at (4,5), (3,6), (6,6) but (6,6) disappearing, so no food at (3,4) or tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4), no food there.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,3), tail at (3,4), which are adjacent? (2,3) and (3,4): Δx=1, Δy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent in grid terms; adjacent means sharing edge, so up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So not adjacent. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |1| = 2, so not adjacent; adjacent would be distance 1 horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from tail food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Since (6,6) is not reachable, ignore it.\n> \n> Target (4,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> (4,5) is closer?

Direction now L.\n> \n> Then, from (1,3), possible moves: since direction L, can go L, U, D, but L to (0,3) — x=0 is wall, so invalid. U to (1,4) — (1,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,4), so cannot go there. D to (1,2) — (1,2) is also obstacle. So from (1,3), only possible move? L to (0,3) wall, invalid. U to (1,4) obstacle, invalid. D to (1,2) obstacle, invalid. So only if I go to (1,3), I might be stuck? But (1,3) itself is free, but after moving there, next moves are blocked.\n> \n> From (1,3), after moving, direction is L.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, but L to (0,3) wall, U to (1,4) obstacle, D to (1,2) obstacle. So no valid moves? But that can't be right; the snake must be able to move.\n> \n> Perhaps I can go to (1,3) and then, since no other moves, I have to go back, but direction is L, so going R would be opposite, not allowed. So from (1,3), with direction L, I can only move L, U, D, but all invalid. So moving to (1,3) is a dead end, should be avoided because on next turn, I might die if no move possible, but the game might force a move, but it could lead to collision or wall.\n> \n> In this case, from (1,3), all adjacent cells are blocked: left wall, up obstacle, down obstacle, and right is (2,3) which is now the neck, but since snake moves, (2,3) will be body, but after moving head to (1,3), the body will move, so (2,3) might be free or not.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 55, snake positions: head (2,3), body segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), the new head is (1,3), and the body shifts: the segment that was at (2,3) moves to where head was?

Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so invalid cells. Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So let's list them:\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> Now, snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - Body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n> \n> Food: (4,5) and (3,6)\n> \n> Head direction: U (up), so from (2,4), moving up would go to (2,5).\n> \n> But (2,5) is not occupied by anything right now? Let's see what's at (2,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4), (2,3), etc. – (2,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has food, but let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (2,4) with direction U.\n> \n> Since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D (down) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D.\n> \n> So from (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,5)\n> \n> - L: to (1,4)\n> \n> - R: to (3,4)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> First, (2,5): is it a wall? Walls are at borders, so (2,5) is within 1-6, y=5, x=2, should be free. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6). (2,5) not in obstacles, so free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,4), (2,3), etc. – no (2,5), so (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): x=1, y=4. Obstacles include (1,4), yes, (1,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,4) is listed, so (1,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Then (3,4): x=3, y=4. Not in obstacle list, not a border, and not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), etc. – (3,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Food is at (4,5) and (3,6), not at (3,4).\n> \n> So from (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,5)\n> \n> - L to (1,4) but (1,4) is obstacle, so invalid\n> \n> - R to (3,4)\n> \n> So only two possible moves: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (4,5) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 56, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 56 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the start of turn t + L? Or after L turns?\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, after this turn, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span S, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, life span decreases by 1, so if S=1, it disappears after turn t, meaning before turn t+1.\n> \n> But for movement, during turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for (4,5), life span 7 at turn 56. After turn 56, life span becomes 6, then 5, ..., until 0, disappears before turn 63? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 56: life span 7, can be eaten on turn 56.\n> \n> After turn 56, life span = 6\n> \n> Turn 57: life span 6, can be eaten\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 62: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> After turn 62, life span 0, disappears, not available on turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life span 9 at turn 56, disappears after turn 64 (since 56+9-1=64? Turn 56: span 9, eaten turn 56; after turn 56, span 8; ... turn 64: span 1, eaten turn 64; after turn 64, span 0, gone for turn 65.\n> \n> Earliest disappearance: for span L, last chance to eat is on turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (4,5): L=7, t=56, last eat on turn 56 + 6 = 62? t + (L-1) = 56 + 6 = turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): L=9, last eat turn 56 + 8 = 64.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (2,4), I can go U to (2,5) or R to (3,4).\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, consider the tail and body for collisions.\n> \n> Snake body: positions, with tail at the end. Tail is (4,4), since positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — so tail is (4,4).\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be freed, but if there was food under it, it can be eaten only if head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, no food under snake, I think. Food is at (4,5) and (3,6), not occupied.\n> \n> (4,5) is adjacent to tail? Tail is (4,4), so (4,5) is up from tail.\n> \n> But tail is at (4,4), and head is at (2,4), not adjacent directly.\n> \n> Head adjacent to tail: positions, head (2,4), tail (4,4), distance |2-4| + |4-4| = 2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,4) adjacent to (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is one possibility.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to the food.\n> \n> First, food at (4,5): this is above (4,4), which is the tail.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, for food under body, but here no food under.\n> \n> Now, for (4,5): if I eat it, snake grows, so new tail will be added, but since I move to (4,5), which is empty, I eat food, then the tail doesn't move, so new segment added at the end.\n> \n> After eating, length increases by one, so the tail stays in place, or the new tail is where the old tail was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the head moves to food cell, and since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose head at H, moves to F (food), then positions become [F, H, body...] and tail remains, so length increases.\n> \n> Then next move, when head moves away, tail moves only if no growth.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,5), if head moves to (4,5), it eats, so tail stays at (4,4) for that turn? Let's think.\n> \n> Sequence: at turn t, snake positions: [head, body..., tail]\n> \n> Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> If new cell has food, then snake grows: new positions [new_head, old_head, body..., tail] — tail not removed, so length +1.\n> \n> If no food, then [new_head, old_head, body..., ] and tail cell is removed, so positions shift, tail moves.\n> \n> But in the case where head moves to tail cell, if tail is about to move, it's safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, for (4,5), it's not tail, it's a separate cell.\n> \n> But (4,5) is adjacent to tail (4,4).\n> \n> Rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n> \n> Here, tail cell is (4,4), which does not have food.

It's turn 57, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

Similarly, (3,6) with life span 8 disappears on turn 65.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a mental grid.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are all walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,4), body: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,4) is the tail? Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (2,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (4,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,3)\n> \n> 6: (5,2)\n> \n> 7: (6,2)\n> \n> 8: (6,3)\n> \n> 9: (6,4)\n> \n> 10: (6,5)\n> \n> 11: (5,5)\n> \n> 12: (5,4) tail\n> \n> (5,4) is the last segment, so tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> Head is at (3,4) facing right (R). So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L instantly because no instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on the next turn. So for turn 57, I can choose U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does.\n> \n> First, move R: from (3,4) to (4,4). Is (4,4) occupied? Snake positions: (3,4) head, (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4). So (4,4) is not in the list, so it's free? Let's check all positions.\n> \n> (4,4): not listed, so empty.\n> \n> Also, check obstacles: internal obstacles include (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), but not (4,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: x=4, y=4 is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but walls are at borders, so (4,4) is not a wall.\n> \n> Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so internal cells are fine.\n> \n> So moving R to (4,4) should be possible.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will have new head at (4,4), and tail moves, so (5,4) might be freed if tail moves, but we need to see the path.\n> \n> Now, move U: up to (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5): not in snake positions? Snake: y=5 has (6,5) and (5,5), but (3,5) not listed. Obstacles: no (3,5), walls no. So free.\n> \n> Move D: down to (3,3). But (3,3) is a body segment! Position index 3 is (3,3), which is the fourth segment? Positions: 0 head, 1 (2,4), 2 (2,3), 3 (3,3), so (3,3) is occupied by body. Cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> So moving D to (3,3) is invalid, would die.\n> \n> Move L: left to (2,4). But (2,4) is position index 1, which is a body segment. Also, since head direction is R, moving L is opposite, but no instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving L is not allowed.\n> \n> So for turn 57, possible actions: U, R, or D? D is invalid because (3,3) is body.\n> \n> U: to (3,5)\n> \n> R: to (4,4)\n> \n> D: to (3,3) but occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> L: not allowed because opposite direction.\n> \n> So only U and R are possible moves for turn 57.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 62? Current turn 57, life span 6, decreases each turn including current, so after 6 turns: turns 57,58,59,60,61,62, so on turn 63 it's gone. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 57, life span 6, after turn 57, it becomes 5, then 4, etc., so it exists for 6 more turns: from 57 to 62 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 57, life_span=6, meaning it will decrease to 5 at the end of turn 57, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,5): life_span=6 at turn 57. After turn 57, it becomes 5. After turn 58, it becomes 4. After turn 59, 3. After turn 60, 2. After turn 61, 1. After turn 62, 0, so it disappears before turn 63. So it can be eaten from turn 57 to 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): life_span=8 at turn 57. After turn 57, 7; ... after turn 64, 0, disappears before turn 65. Can be eaten from 57 to 64.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,4). Food at (4,5) is one step away: to reach (4,5), I need to move to (4,4) then up, or directly if possible, but from (3,4), (4,5) is not adjacent? Adjacent cells: (3,4) has neighbors: (3,5) up, (3,3) down, (2,4) left, (4,4) right.\n> \n> (4,5) is at row 4, col 5, which is northeast of (3,4). From (3,4), (4,5) is not directly adjacent; it's diagonal, so not reachable in one move. I need to move to (4,4) or (3,5) first.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), which is directly above (3,4)? (3,4) to (3,6) is two steps up, since (3,5) in between.\n> \n> (3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n> \n> From (3,4), moving U to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U on turn 57: to (3,5)\n> \n> Then, from there, I can go to (3,6) to eat the food, but is (3,6) safe?\n> \n> (3,6): is it occupied? Snake positions: no (3,6), obstacles: internal obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), but (3,6) not listed, walls no. So (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> But food is there, so if I move to (3,6), I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (5,4), not near (3,6), so no issue.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so new tail position.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (3,5) on turn 57.\n> \n> Then on turn 58, head at (3,5), direction U (since I moved U, so new direction U).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, but not D (down) instantly.\n> \n> U to (3,6) to eat food.\n> \n> (3,6) has food, value +1, so if I move there on turn 58, I eat it, snake grows to length 14, tail remains or moves? When I eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so new segment added.\n> \n> Sequence: on turn 57, move to (3,5). (3,5) may or may not have food? Currently, no food at (3,5), only at (4,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> So move to (3,5), no food, so snake moves, head to (3,5), tail moves from (5,4) to? When no food eaten, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Current snake: positions from head to tail: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> After move U to (3,5): new head at (3,5), then the body: since no food eaten, the tail (5,4) is removed, so new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — (5,5) is now the second last, tail is (5,5)? Original tail was (5,4), removed, so new tail is the previous segment, which was (5,5) before move? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: segments: 0: (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4)\n> \n> After moving U to (3,5), no food, so new head: (3,5), then the body from index 0 to 11: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So tail is now (5,5), and (5,4) is gone.\n> \n> Length still 13.\n> \n> Now on turn 58, head at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> I can move U to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (3,6) has food, so if I move to (3,6), I eat it, snake grows, so new head at (3,6), and tail does not move, so the body includes the previous head (3,5) and all except tail is not removed.\n> \n> After eating, new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — and since I ate, tail remains, so (5,5) is still there, but now the segment before was (6,5), so positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So tail at (5,5), length 14.\n> \n> (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? (3,6) is not occupied by body, and no wall, so yes.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> After eating at (3,6), head at (3,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves from there: U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, since border, so cannot move up, collision.\n> \n> L to (2,6): (2,6) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,6), yes, (2,6) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> R to (4,6): (4,6) is also an internal obstacle, listed.\n> \n> So from (3,6), all possible moves are blocked: U to wall, L to obstacle, R to obstacle. Only D is possible but cannot because of instant reverse? Current direction is U, so moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> After moving U to (3,6), direction is U, so for next turn, I can only move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> But U is wall, L is obstacle (2,6), R is obstacle (4,6), so no possible moves! I would be trapped and die on the next turn.\n> \n> That's a disaster.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (3,6) to eat the food leads to immediate death on the following turn because no escape.\n> \n> So this path is suicidal.\n> \n> Therefore, I should not go for (3,6) directly from here, at least not via (3,5) on turn 57.\n> \n> Perhaps I can approach (3,6) from another direction, but from (3,4), the only ways to (3,6) are through (3,5) or other paths, but (3,5) is the direct way.\n> \n> But since (3,6) is a dead end, I should avoid going there unless I have a way out.\n> \n> But after eating, I need to move away, but all adjacent cells are blocked.\n> \n> Adjacent to (3,6): (3,7) wall, (2,6) obstacle, (4,6) obstacle, (3,5) which is now body, so no free cell to move to. So indeed, death on turn 59 if I go there on turn 58.\n> \n> Therefore, I must not eat (3,6) at this point, or find a different approach.\n> \n> But with the obstacles, it's impossible to reach (3,6) without being trapped, I think.\n> \n> Unless I don't go directly.\n> \n> For example, if I go to (4,4) first or something.\n> \n> But let's not pursue (3,6) for now, since it's risky.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is one step from (4,4) or from (3,5), etc.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) might have risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving R on turn 57 to (4,4).\n> \n> Then head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Now, from (4,4), I can move to (4,5) to eat the food, since (4,5) has food.\n> \n> Move U to (4,5), or other directions.\n> \n> But (4,5) is adjacent right?

Since value 1, positive, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (3,6), and body: previous head (3,5) becomes new segment, so snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), ... up to (5,5)] but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows to 14 segments.\n> \n> After eating food, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays in place? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> From rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And \"the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, body segments follow.\n> \n> So, after moving to food, the snake grows, meaning the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the new position has head at food, then previous head, then body, and tail remains.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to food, new head is food cell, then the previous head position becomes the second segment, and so on, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment stays, so we add a new segment.\n> \n> Initial positions: 13 segments.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to (3,6), so new head (3,6), then previous head (3,5) is now second, (3,4) is third, ..., up to (5,5) is now the 13th, but since we add a segment, the tail (5,5) remains, and a new tail is added? No.\n> \n> Typically, when snake eats, it moves head to food, and the body follows, but since it grows, the tail doesn't retreat, so the new position has one more segment.\n> \n> So positions: [new_head, old_head, old_segment2, ..., old_tail] but since tail doesn't move, old_tail is still there, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> In terms of list: after move, head is at new position, and the body includes all previous positions including the tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, before move: segments S0 to S12, S0 head.\n> \n> After move to food: new head at food, then S0, S1, ..., S12, so now 14 segments.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,6), eat food, new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — that's 14 positions.\n> \n> (5,5) is still the tail, but now it's the last segment.\n> \n> Direction after move: since we moved U, new head direction is U.\n> \n> But we need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (2,5): no food there, so head moves to (2,5), body follows, tail moves away.

When head moves, tail moves only if no food eaten. Since no food, head to (2,5), then the body: second segment is previous head (3,5), third is previous second (3,4), and so on, up to previous second last (6,5) becomes new second last, and previous tail (5,5) is removed, so tail is now at (6,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,5), 12: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving L to (2,5) with no food: new head at (2,5), then new segment 1: old head (3,5), new segment 2: old seg1 (3,4), new segment 3: old seg2 (2,4), ..., new segment 11: old seg10 (6,4), new segment 12: old seg11 (6,5), and tail old seg12 (5,5) is removed.

When I move, the tail will move forward, so if head moves to a new position, the tail leaves its position.\n> \n> If I move right to (5,5), which is currently occupied by the tail. But according to rules, moving into the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move, so no collision. Only if it's a body segment that isn't the tail, it's deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's check adjacency.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), tail at (5,5). Are they adjacent? (4,5) and (5,5) are adjacent horizontally, so yes, head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, is there food on the tail? Tail is at (5,5), and food is at (3,6) and (6,1), not at (5,5). So no food on tail cell. Therefore, moving to (5,5) should be safe, as tail moves away.\n> \n> If I move to (5,5), head goes to (5,5), and since it was tail, and no food, snake grows? Only if I eat food. (5,5) has no food, so moving there doesn't eat anything, length unchanged, tail moves, so new head position (5,5), and tail moves from (5,5) to... when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> Standard Snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake shifts.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is empty? No, it has the tail, but since it's the tail, moving to it is fine as long as no food or the special case.\n> \n> But (5,5) is currently occupied by tail, but no food there, so moving to (5,5): head moves to (5,5), which was tail, but since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, and a new segment is added at head? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, then snake grows: head occupies the food cell, tail remains, so length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to cell, and tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> But when head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, it's a bit special.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving to tail cell: since no food there (we assume), it's like moving to an empty cell, but the cell has tail, but since tail moves away, it's safe.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to tail cell, and no food, then effectively, the snake moves forward, tail is cut off, so the new position is head at former tail, and the segment before tail becomes new tail.\n> \n> But since we're moving to the tail cell, and no food, it should be fine; collision only if it's a body segment that isn't tail.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is tail, so moving there should be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm with Tail Reward Danger: it says if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, no food on tail, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving right to (5,5) seems possible.\n> \n> But (5,5) is also listed as a position, but after move, it will be head.\n> \n> Now, other options: up to (4,6) or down to (4,4).\n> \n> (4,6): is that a wall or obstacle? Walls: border is x=0,7 or y=0,7, so y=6 is not border, x=4 not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6) is an obstacle! Look: internal obstacles include (4,6).

Obstacles: (4,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) not listed, so should be free, but has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) not occupied, not obstacle except border? x=6,y=1: border is x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=6 is not border? x=7 is border, x=6 is within 1 to 6?

Similarly, (6,1) life span 8: present turns 60 to 67, gone on turn 68.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turns 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and possibly beyond, but at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,5), direction R (right). So from (5,5), possible moves are U (up to (5,6)), D (down to (5,4)), L (left to (4,5)), or R (right to (6,5)).\n> \n> But I have to consider the movement constraints and collisions.\n> \n> First, check immediate moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6). Is this safe? (5,6) is not a wall? Walls: border y=7 is top, so y=6 is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not border; x=5, y=6. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is a wall, but (5,6) is not listed, so it should be free. Snake body: current positions include (4,5), (3,5), etc., and (6,5) is the tail? Snake positions: (5,5) head, then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (6,5) is the tail end.\n> \n> (5,6): is it occupied? Not in snake positions, and not a wall, so moving U to (5,6) seems possible.\n> \n> But direction: current head direction is R, so moving U is not opposite, it's perpendicular. Opposite of R is L, so U is allowed since no instant reverse; only can't move directly opposite.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4). (5,4) not in walls or snake? Snake has (6,4) and (6,5), but (5,4) not listed. Walls: no, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: to (4,5). (4,5) is the second segment of the snake! Snake positions: head (5,5), then (4,5) is the first body segment. So moving left to (4,5) would cause collision with body, since it's occupied by the snake itself, except for the tail which moves.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment, but can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (6,5). (4,5) is the second segment, so if head moves to (4,5), it would collide with the body segment there before it moves. The snake moves: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that isn't the tail, it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,5), it's currently occupied by the first body segment. After head moves to (4,5), the body segments shift: the head was at (5,5), so if head moves left to (4,5), then the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where? The movement happens sequentially: head moves first to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n> \n> But if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, except the tail, it dies because collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (6,5). Therefore, moving to (4,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, R: to (6,5). (6,5) is the current tail position. Since it's the tail, moving to (6,5) should be safe because the tail will move away after the head eats or not, but here no food, so tail moves.\n> \n> If head moves to (6,5), which is tail, and there's no food there, then the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, so head is now at (6,5), tail was there but moves, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, (6,5) is tail, so moving to it is safe.\n> \n> Also, D to (5,4) should be safe, as no body there.\n> \n> U to (5,6) should be safe.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,6) at (3,6) with life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 64 to get it.\n> \n> (6,1) at (6,1) with life span 8, so more time.\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3,y=6.

It's turn 61. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and those specific cells blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake has 14 segments. Head is at (5,4) and direction is down. Since direction is down, moving down would go to (5,3), but (5,3) is part of the body, so that would be a collision if it moves down? No, let's see.\n> \n> The head is at (5,4), and direction is down. Down means decreasing y, so (x, y-1). So from (5,4), down would be to (5,3). But (5,3) is the 10th segment in the list: positions are [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), ...] so (5,3) is occupied by the body. If the snake moves down to (5,3), it would collide with its own body because (5,3) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,4). Let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,4) head\n> \n> 1: (5,5)\n> \n> 2: (4,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (2,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,3)\n> \n> 7: (3,3)\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: (5,3)\n> \n> 10: (5,2)  // (5,2) is position 10? Positions: 0: (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,2), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4) tail. So tail is (6,4).\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), direction down. Moving down to (5,3) would go to cell occupied by segment 9, which is not the tail. The tail is at (6,4), so moving to (5,3) would cause collision because it's a body segment, not the tail that will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (5,3) is not the tail; tail is (6,4), so it's a body segment, collision. Therefore, moving down is impossible; it would kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: left from (5,4) is (4,4). Is (4,4) occupied? Let's see the positions: (4,4) not listed, so should be free? Positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), etc. (3,4) is there, but (4,4) is not in the list. So (4,4) might be free, but I need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So (4,4) is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not occupied by snake, so should be free.\n> \n> Moving right: from (5,4) to (6,4). (6,4) is occupied by segment 12? Positions: 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4) tail. (6,4) is the tail. So moving to (6,4) is possible because it's the tail, and the tail will move forward when the snake moves.\n> \n> Moving up: from (5,4) to (5,5). (5,5) is segment 1, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so possible moves: cannot move opposite, but down is current, so moving down is one option, but we saw it leads to (5,3) which is body, collision.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Head at (5,4):\n> \n> - U: (5,5) - occupied by body segment 1, collision.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) - occupied by body segment 9, collision.\n> \n> - L: (4,4) - not occupied, not wall? (4,4) is x=4,y=4. Walls: borders, internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). None at (4,4), so free.\n> \n> - R: (6,4) - occupied by tail segment 13? Positions: 13: (6,4) tail. So (6,4) is tail, so moving there is ok, because tail will move.\n> \n> So possible moves from current position: Left to (4,4) or Right to (6,4).\n> \n> Cannot move up or down due to collision.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, since value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6) life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 61, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 64? Let's see: on turn 61, life span is 4, so after this turn, it decreases to 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 on turn 65? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then after N turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn, starting from N down to 0.\n> \n> At turn 61, for (3,6): life span 4, so after turn 61, it will have 3 left; after turn 62, 2 left; after turn 63, 1 left; after turn 64, 0, so it disappears before turn 65? Or at the end of turn 64?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the beginning of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases during the turn, so after the turn, it becomes L-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, if the head moves to a food cell during a turn, it eats it before it disappears.\n> \n> For (3,6) at turn 61, life span 4: so it can be eaten on turns 61,62,63,64, and disappears after turn 64 or before turn 65? Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn t=61.\n> \n> Possible actions: L or R.\n> \n> If I go left to (4,4), or right to (6,4).\n> \n> First, let's see the grid to understand.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,4)\n> \n> Food: (3,6), (6,1), (1,1)\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3,y=6. Is it accessible? (3,6) is not a wall? Internal walls: (4,6) is wall, (2,6) is wall, but (3,6) not listed, so should be free except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): x=6,y=1, not wall.\n> \n> (1,1): x=1,y=1, not wall.\n> \n> But (1,4) is wall, (1,5) is wall, etc.\n> \n> Now, if I move right to (6,4), that's the tail, so the snake moves, head to (6,4), and tail moves from (6,4) to... when head moves to tail, the tail doesn't move away; let's think.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move. If not food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, (6,4) is the current tail, and it has no food? The food is at (3,6), (6,1), (1,1), not at (6,4), so (6,4) is empty, no food. So if head moves to (6,4), it doesn't eat, so tail moves away. The new head is at (6,4), and the tail was at (6,4), but since head moves there, and no food, the tail should move to the previous position or something. Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail is removed, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,4): head moves from (5,4) to (6,4), which was tail. Since (6,4) is not food, the tail moves away, meaning segment 13 (tail) is removed, and the new tail is segment 12 (6,3) or something. After move, head is at (6,4), and the body follows: the segment that was at (6,4) is now head, and tail is removed, so positions: new head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc., up to (6,3) which was segment 12, but (6,3) is now part of body, and tail is the previous segment 11 or something. Let's list new positions after move right.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ]\n> \n> After moving right to (6,4): head moves to (6,4), which was tail. Since no food, tail is removed, so the new positions are: head at (6,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes segment 1, then (5,5) segment 2, ..., up to (6,3) which was segment 12, becomes the new tail? Positions: new head: (6,4), then the rest: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). So tail is now (6,3), and (6,4) is head.\n> \n> Similarly, if move left to (4,4): head to (4,4), new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (6,3), tail (6,4)? After move, tail moves if no food. (4,4) has no food, so tail is removed. Current tail is (6,4), so after head moves to (4,4), new head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (6,4) is removed, so new tail is (6,3).\n> \n> In both cases, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one if no food eaten.\n> \n> But we need to eat food to grow.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,6) at (3,6), life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 64.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 7, so by turn 67.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 10, by turn 70.\n> \n> But we need to think 5 turns ahead, so up to turn 66.\n> \n> First, let's consider the options for turn 61.\n> \n> Action: L or R.\n> \n> If I go left to (4,4), then from there, I can go to adjacent cells.\n> \n> (4,4) neighbors: U (4,5), D (4,3), L (3,4), R (5,4)\n> \n> But (4,5) is occupied by body segment 2? Current positions, (4,5) is segment 2.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), etc. So (4,5) is now segment 3? Let's list: new positions after move left: head (4,4), then seg1: (5,4), seg2: (5,5), seg3: (4,5), seg4: (3,5), seg5: (3,4), seg6: (2,4), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (3,3), seg9: (4,3), seg10: (5,3), seg11: (5,2), seg12: (6,2), seg13: (6,3). Tail is (6,3).\n> \n> From head at (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied by seg3, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - D to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by seg9? Positions: seg9 is (4,3), which is body, not tail (tail is (6,3)), so collision.\n> \n> - L to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by seg5, body, collision.\n> \n> - R to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by seg1, which is the previous head, now body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> After moving to (4,4), all adjacent cells are occupied by body except possibly walls, but here all are body cells, so no move is possible? That can't be right.\n> \n> (4,4) neighbors: up (4,5) - seg3, down (4,3) - seg9, left (3,4) - seg5, right (5,4) - seg1, all body segments, and since tail is at (6,3), none of these are tail, so moving to any would cause collision. So from (4,4), I am trapped, no possible move, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving left to (4,4) on turn 61 is suicide; I have no escape.\n> \n> But is that correct? Let me double-check.\n> \n> After moving to (4,4) on turn 61, the positions are:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Seg1: (5,4)  // previous head\n> \n> - Seg2: (5,5)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - Seg3: (4,5)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - Seg4: (3,5)  // previous seg3\n> \n> - Seg5: (3,4)  // previous seg4\n> \n> - Seg6: (2,4)  // previous seg5\n> \n> - Seg7: (2,3)  // previous seg6\n> \n> - Seg8: (3,3)  // previous seg7\n> \n> - Seg9: (4,3)  // previous seg8\n> \n> - Seg10: (5,3)  // previous seg9\n> \n> - Seg11: (5,2)  // previous seg10\n> \n> - Seg12: (6,2)  // previous seg11\n> \n> - Seg13: (6,3)  // previous seg12, tail\n> \n> Now, from (4,4):\n> \n> - Up to (4,5): occupied by seg3 (body)\n> \n> - Down to (4,3): occupied by seg9 (body)\n> \n> - Left to (3,4): occupied by seg5 (body)\n> \n> - Right to (5,4): occupied by seg1 (body)\n> \n> All are body cells, not tail, so moving to any would cause collision. Indeed, no move possible, death on next turn.\n> \n> Therefore, moving left to (4,4) is not viable; it leads to immediate death.\n> \n> The only other option is to move right to (6,4) on turn 61.\n> \n> Move right to (6,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> (6,4) has no food, so no eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> New positions after move: head at (6,4), then seg1: (5,4), seg2: (5,5), seg3: (4,5), seg4: (3,5), seg5: (3,4), seg6: (2,4), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (3,3), seg9: (4,3), seg10: (5,3), seg11: (5,2), seg12: (6,2), seg13: (6,3).

But if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail position is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> But in this case, for turn t1=62, head at (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - R: (7,4) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - U: (6,5) - need to check if this cell is occupied or wall.\n> \n> (6,5): is it wall? Borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border. y=7 is top, but y=5 not border. Internal walls: (4,6), (1,2), etc., no (6,5), so not wall. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,4) head, (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). No (6,5), so free.\n> \n> - D: (6,3) - this is the tail. Since tail will move, it should be safe to move there, as long as after move, head and tail don't collide, but when head moves to tail, tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> - L: (5,4) - but (5,4) is the second segment. If I move left to (5,4), that's directly into the body, which is collision and death. Also, since direction is R, moving L is opposite direction, which is not allowed anyway. So L is invalid both because opposite and because body collision.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, D to (6,3): (6,3) is tail, so after move, head moves to (6,3), tail moves from (6,3) to... where? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, no food at (6,3), I think. Food is at (3,6), (6,1), (1,1). Not at (6,3). So if I move D to (6,3), head goes to (6,3), which was tail, but tail moves to the previous position of segment 12, which is (6,2). Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> If move D to (6,3): new head at (6,3). Then the body segments: the first body segment (index 1) moves to previous head position (6,4), then index 2 to (5,4), index 3 to (5,5), and so on, up to index 13 (tail) moves to (6,2). But (6,3) was tail, now head is there, but since tail moves, the cell is vacated except for head.\n> \n> In terms of collision: when head moves to (6,3), which was occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it's not occupied at that instant? The rule says it's safe to move to tail position because tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, for U to (6,5): new head at (6,5), then body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc., tail at (6,2) moves to (5,2) or something.\n> \n> Now, food: we have food at (3,6), (6,1), (1,1).\n> \n> (3,6): value 1, life span 3, so at turn 62, it has 3 turns left, including this turn, so if not eaten by turn 64, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 6, gone by turn 68? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span N, it disappears after N turns, so after turn t1 + N - 1 or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 62, food with life span 3: after 3 turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> So at turn 62, countdown=3, after turn 62, countdown=2; after turn 63, countdown=1; after turn 64, countdown=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 62,63,64. Disappears before turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 6: can be eaten turn 62 to 67, disappears turn 68.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 9: eaten turn 62 to 70, disappears turn 71.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move. I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Possible moves: U or D.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,5), what happens? (6,5) is free, no food there. Then head at (6,5). Direction would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: since direction U, cannot go D (down). Can go U, L, R.\n> \n> U: (6,6) - y=6, not border? y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is ok, but check if wall or occupied. Not wall, not occupied currently.\n> \n> L: (5,5) - is it occupied? Current snake has (5,5) as segment 2. But after move to (6,5), the body will be at (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc. So (5,5) will be occupied by body, so moving L to (5,5) would be collision.\n> \n> After move U to (6,5):\n> \n> New positions: head (6,5), body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2) — and tail was (6,3), but since no food eaten, tail moves from (6,3) to (6,2)? Let's list new segments.\n> \n> When head moves to (6,5), the new body starts from previous head (6,4), then previous body 1 (5,4), previous body 2 (5,5), previous body 3 (4,5), ..., up to previous body 12 (6,2), and previous body 13 (6,3) is not included, so tail is at (6,2). The snake has 14 segments, no food eaten, so length same, tail removed.\n> \n> Segments: index 0: new head (6,5)\n> \n> Then body: index 1: previous head (6,4)\n> \n> index 2: previous body1 (5,4)\n> \n> index 3: previous body2 (5,5)\n> \n> index 4: previous body3 (4,5)\n> \n> index 5: previous body4 (3,5)\n> \n> index 6: previous body5 (3,4)\n> \n> index 7: previous body6 (2,4)\n> \n> index 8: previous body7 (2,3)\n> \n> index 9: previous body8 (3,3)\n> \n> index 10: previous body9 (4,3)\n> \n> index 11: previous body10 (5,3)\n> \n> index 12: previous body11 (5,2)\n> \n> index 13: previous body12 (6,2) — this is the new tail, since previous body13 (6,3) is dropped.\n> \n> Previous positions: 0:(6,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(5,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(3,5), 5:(3,4), 6:(2,4), 7:(2,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(4,3), 10:(5,3), 11:(5,2), 12:(6,2), 13:(6,3)\n> \n> After move to (6,5), new head at (6,5), then body: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2) ] — so 13 segments, tail at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), direction U, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) — free?

Let's see:\n> \n> Old positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2) ]\n> \n> After move down to (6,2): head moves to (6,2), but (6,2) was tail. Since no food, we remove the tail segment, which is (6,2), so new snake: head at (6,2), then the body is old positions 0 to 12 except the last is removed? Positions: the segments shift.\n> \n> New head: (6,2)\n> \n> Then the body: the old head (6,3) becomes segment 1, old segment 1 (6,4) becomes segment 2, ..., old segment 12 (5,2) becomes segment 13? But since we removed the tail, the new snake has one less segment? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: let S be the list.\n> \n> After move: new head position is the moved-to cell.\n> \n> Then the body segments: new segment i is old segment i-1 for i=1 to len-1.\n> \n> But tail is old segment len-2? Example:\n> \n> Old: S[0] = head, S[1] to S[13] body, S[13] tail.\n> \n> After move to a new cell without eating:\n> \n> New S[0] = new position\n> \n> New S[1] = old S[0]\n> \n> New S[2] = old S[1]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New S[13] = old S[12]  // since tail is removed, we have one less segment? No, the number of segments decreases only if we don't eat, but in terms of positions.\n> \n> Old snake length 14 segments.\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell, say C\n> \n> - Then new positions: [C, old_S[0], old_S[1], ..., old_S[12]] but old_S[12] is (5,2), and old_S[13] is tail which is not included, so new positions: [C, old_S[0], old_S[1], ..., old_S[12]] which is 13 positions, so length decreases by 1? But in snake, when you don't eat, length stays the same, but tail moves, so the last position is removed.\n> \n> Typically, for a snake of length L, there are L segments.\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - Specifically, the new body segment 1 is the old head position.\n> \n> - New body segment 2 is old body segment 1 position, and so on.\n> \n> - The tail segment (last) is removed, so the new snake has the same segments as before minus the tail, plus the new head? No.\n> \n> List:\n> \n> Old positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1} (tail)\n> \n> After moving head to new position H_new:\n> \n> - New head: H_new\n> \n> - New body segment 1: old P0\n> \n> - New body segment 2: old P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New body segment L-1: old P_{L-2}\n> \n> - But we have L-1 segments here, missing the tail. Since we didn't eat, the tail is not replaced, so the new snake has length L-1? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> In classic snake, when you move without eating food, the snake moves forward: the head occupies a new cell, each subsequent segment occupies the cell where the previous segment was, and the tail cell is vacated. So the number of segments remains the same, but the positions shift.\n> \n> For example, with segments: H, B1, B2, T\n> \n> After move to new cell N without eating:\n> \n> - New head: N\n> \n> - New B1: H\n> \n> - New B2: B1\n> \n> - New T: B2  // so the old T is left, but since it moved, it's free.\n> \n> Positions: old: H at pos, B1 at pos, B2 at pos, T at pos.\n> \n> After move: head to new pos, then B1 to old H pos, B2 to old B1 pos, T to old B2 pos. So the old T pos is now free.\n> \n> The snake length remains the same.\n> \n> In terms of list, new positions: [N, old_H, old_B1, old_B2] but since T was at old_B2? Let's index.\n> \n> Set positions: index 0: head, 1: neck, 2: body, ..., L-1: tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell without eating:\n> \n> - New position 0: the new head position\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New position L-1: old position L-2\n> \n> So the new tail is at old position L-2, and old position L-1 is vacated.\n> \n> The number of segments is the same, but all positions shift.\n> \n> In this case, for our snake, L=14, positions from 0 to 13.\n> \n> After move down to (6,2):\n> \n> New head: (6,2)\n> \n> New pos 1: old pos 0 = (6,3)\n> \n> New pos 2: old pos 1 = (6,4)\n> \n> New pos 3: old pos 2 = (5,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New pos 13: old pos 12 = (5,2)\n> \n> Old pos 13 was (6,2), which is now the new head, so it's occupied, but no problem.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) was tail, now head is there, and the new tail is at old pos 12 (5,2).\n> \n> So moving to the current tail position is safe as long as there is no food there that we eat, but since no food, it's fine.\n> \n> If there was food and we eat it, we grow, so tail doesn't move, and we might collide if head and new tail are at same position, but only if we were adjacent to tail before eating.\n> \n> But here no food at (6,2), so safe.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - Up: (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by body segment (old pos 1), so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> - Down: (6,2) - currently occupied by tail, but as above, after move, it's safe.\n> \n> - Left: (5,3) - (5,3) is old pos 11, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (5,3) would be collision with body.\n> \n> - Right: (7,3) - x=7 is wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (6,2)? But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (7,3) is wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So for (6,3), adjacent:\n> \n> - North: (6,4) - y+1, but (6,4) is body, occupied\n> \n> - South: (6,2) - y-1, currently tail\n> \n> - West: (5,3) - x-1, body occupied\n> \n> - East: (7,3) - wall\n> \n> So indeed, only down to (6,2) is possible? But is (6,2) safe? Yes, as per above.\n> \n> But the head direction is down, so moving down is allowed, no reverse issue.\n> \n> Reverse would be moving up, but up is not possible anyway.\n> \n> So for turn 63, I must move down to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's make sure about the food and life span.\n> \n> At turn 63, food at (3,6) life span 2, so can be eaten on turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 5, (1,1) life span 8.\n> \n> After moving down to (6,2), new head at (6,2), new tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, for turn 64, head at (6,2), direction down? Last move was down, so direction is down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) - now, after move, what is at (6,3)? New positions after turn 63 move: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), etc. So (6,3) is new body segment 1.\n> \n> So moving up to (6,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> - Down: (6,1) - y-1=1, so (6,1). Is this wall? y=1, not y=0, and x=6 not border wall. Internal walls? (6,1) not in internal obstacles list. Food? (6,1) has food with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) - x-1=5,y=2. (5,2) is new tail position after turn 63 move? After move, new tail is at (5,2), which is old pos 12.\n> \n> But (5,2) is occupied by tail, so moving left to (5,2) is moving to tail cell.\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) - x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,6) etc, not relevant here.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: to (6,1), which has food.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,2), which is tail cell.\n> \n> Now, moving to (5,2): since it's tail, and there might be food? But (5,2) is not listed as food position. Food are at (3,6), (6,1), (1,1). So no food at (5,2), so moving left to (5,2) is safe, similar to before.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,1), I eat the food there, since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> Food at (6,1), value +1, so I eat it, length increases.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But first, for turn 63, I have to move down, no choice.\n> \n> So action turn 63: D\n> \n> Then turn 64: from (6,2), I can move down to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n> \n> Moving to (6,1) eats food, grows.\n> \n> Moving to (5,2) no food, just move.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (3,6) has life span 2 at turn 63, so at turn 64, life span 1, still available, disappears after turn 64, so can be eaten on turn 64.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 5 at turn 63, at turn 64 it will be 4, etc.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 8, long time.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (6,1) on turn 64, I eat it, grow, so new head at (6,1), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Positions: after turn 63 move, snake is at [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2)] length 14.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,1) on turn 64 and eat food:\n> \n> New head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then since food eaten, tail remains, so new positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2) ] so length 15, tail at (5,2).\n> \n> The food at (6,1) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,2) on turn 64, no food eaten, so new head: (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), etc., new tail at (5,3)?

It's turn 64, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there are internal obstacles that block cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,2), and direction is Down. Since direction is D, that means the snake was moving down to get to (6,2). The positions are:\n> \n> - Head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Body: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2) is the tail? Let's list them in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,2) - head\n> \n> Index 1: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 4: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 7: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 8: (2,4)\n> \n> Index 9: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 10: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 11: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 12: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,2) - this should be the tail.\n> \n> But (5,2) is one above (6,2)? y=2 is the same, x=5 and x=6, so adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Direction is down, meaning the head moved down to (6,2). Before that, head was at (6,1) or something? Let's see the positions: head at (6,2), then (6,3) which is below it? y=3 is below y=2 if we consider y increasing down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top, y increases down, so (6,2) to (6,3) is moving down, which matches direction D.\n> \n> Then (6,4) is further down, then (5,4) left, and so on.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,2), which is left of head? (5,2) and head (6,2), so same y, x=5 vs x=6.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6,1,1) meaning (x,y, life_span, value) so (3,6) with life_span 1, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1,4,1) (6,1) life 4, value 1\n> \n> - (1,1,7,1) (1,1) life 7, value 1\n> \n> - (6,3,10,1) (6,3) life 10, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life spans: (3,6) has only 1 turn left, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since it's turn 64, and life_span decreases each turn including current, so if not eaten now, it vanishes.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) has life 4, so it will last 4 more turns including current, so until turn 67 or something? Life_span decreases every turn, so at turn 64, life_span is N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns where countdown >0.\n> \n> For (3,6): life_span 1 at turn 64, so if not eaten on turn 64, it disappears; it can only be eaten on turn 64.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life_span 4, can be eaten on turns 64,65,66,67.\n> \n> (1,1) life_span 7, turns 64 to 70.\n> \n> (6,3) life_span 10, turns 64 to 73.\n> \n> Now, head is at (6,2), direction D (down). Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move D (continue down), L (left), or R (right), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move up. Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around head (6,2):\n> \n> - Down: (6,3) but (6,3) is a body segment? Snake positions: (6,2) head, then (6,3) is the first body segment. So (6,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Moving down to (6,3) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail in a way that can be moved into safely? Rule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment, except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward.\n> \n> Here, (6,3) is not the tail; tail is (5,2). (6,3) is the segment right after head, so moving down to (6,3) would collide with body immediately, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (5,2) but (5,2) is the tail. Tail is at (5,2), so moving left to (5,2) should be safe because the tail will move away when the snake moves forward.\n> \n> Right: (7,2) but x=7 is wall, since border x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> Up: (6,1) but cannot move up because it's opposite direction? Current direction is D, so moving U is not allowed.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,2) with direction D:\n> \n> - U: not allowed (opposite)\n> \n> - D: to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by snake body (index 1), so collision.\n> \n> - L: to (5,2), which is the tail (index 13), so should be safe since tail moves.\n> \n> - R: to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (5,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), etc., and tail (5,2). So (5,2) is the last segment.\n> \n> When snake moves, if head moves to (5,2), which is current tail, then the tail will move to the next position, but since it's the end, the tail segment is removed when snake grows, but here, if I move to (5,2), and if I don't eat food, the tail stays or moves?\n> \n> General snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If head eats food, a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases. If not, tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move head to (5,2), which is current tail position, then after the move, the new head is at (5,2), and the old tail (5,2) is now part of body, but since the snake moves, the segment that was at (5,2) will be gone if no food eaten, or stay if food eaten.\n> \n> But at the moment of move, moving head to a cell occupied by tail is allowed because the tail will vacate that cell when the snake moves, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (5,2), and (5,2) is tail, it should be safe.\n> \n> Now, is there food at (5,2)? Food positions: (3,6), (6,1), (1,1), (6,3). No food at (5,2), so if I move to (5,2), no food eaten, so tail is removed, meaning the segment at (5,2) is gone, and new positions: head at (5,2), then body from (6,2) onwards except tail removed.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,2), then the previous head (6,2) becomes body, so (5,2) head, then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), etc., but tail was (5,2), which is now head, so the last segment before was (5,3)? Positions: index 13 is (5,2) tail, index 12 is (5,3), etc.\n> \n> List positions: indices: 0: (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2)\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2), which is current position of index 13.\n> \n> After move, if no food, new head is at (5,2), then body segments: the previous segments from index 0 to 12, but index 0 (6,2) becomes body segment 1, index 1 (6,3) becomes body segment 2, ..., up to index 12 (5,3) becomes the last body segment, and index 13 (5,2) is now head, so it's removed from tail? Since no food, tail is not grown, so the last segment is removed. So new positions: head at (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So length decreases by one? No, length should stay the same if no food eaten.\n> \n> Snake has 14 segments: positions from 0 to 13, 14 cells.\n> \n> After moving without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed. So new snake: head at new position, then segments 0 to 12 become the body, but segment 0 was head, now it's body, segment 1 to 12, and segment 13 is gone. So new positions: new head at (5,2), then (6,2) (previous head), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). That's 14 positions? New head + 13 body segments, but we started with 14, after move no food, should be 13 segments? I think I miscounted.\n> \n> Initial positions: 14 segments: indices 0 to 13.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, say C. Then the body: segment 0 moves to where segment 1 was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake moves, the head goes to a new cell. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n> \n> So, after head moves to new position, the segment that was at index 0 (head) is now at the new head position? Better to think: the new body segment 1 is the old position of head (index 0). New body segment 2 is old position of index 1, and so on, up to new body segment k is old position of index k-1, and the last body segment is old position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Specifically: new head at (5,2).\n> \n> New body segment 1: old position of head, which is (6,2)\n> \n> New body segment 2: old position of index 1, which is (6,3)\n> \n> New body segment 3: old position of index 2, (6,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New body segment 13: old position of index 12, which is (5,3)\n> \n> And the old tail at index 13 (5,2) is vacated since no food, so not part of snake anymore.\n> \n> So new snake: head (5,2), body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So 14 segments? Head + 13 body = 14, but we had 14, after move no food, should be 13 segments? Contradiction.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Initial snake has N segments. When it moves without eating food, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is removed, so new snake has N segments.\n> \n> Here N=14 segments.\n> \n> After move to (5,2), which is different from current positions.\n> \n> New head: (5,2)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the previous head position (6,2)\n> \n> Second body segment is previous index 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> The 13th body segment is previous index 12 position (5,3)\n> \n> Previous index 13 was (5,2), but since head moved there, and no food, that cell is no longer part of snake, so we don't have a segment for old index 13.\n> \n> So new snake positions: head (5,2), and segments from old index 0 to 12: but old index 0 is now body segment 1, old index 1 is body segment 2, ..., old index 12 is body segment 13.\n> \n> Body segments: 1 to 13, with positions: body1: (6,2), body2: (6,3), body3: (6,4), body4: (5,4), body5: (5,5), body6: (4,5), body7: (3,5), body8: (3,4), body9: (2,4), body10: (2,3), body11: (3,3), body12: (4,3), body13: (5,3)\n> \n> So head and 13 body segments, total 14, but it should be 13 after no food? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the count includes the head as position 0.\n> \n> Initial: 14 positions.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, so new position 0 is (5,2)\n> \n> New position 1 is old position 0 (6,2)\n> \n> New position 2 is old position 1 (6,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position 13 is old position 12 (5,3)\n> \n> Old position 13 (5,2) is not used and vacated.\n> \n> But new position 0 to 13 is 14 positions, but old position 13 is gone, so we have positions from old 0 to 12 mapped to new 1 to 13, and new head at new 0.\n> \n> So number of segments remains the same only if food is eaten; if not, the tail is removed, so new snake has one less segment? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental mistake.\n> \n> In snake game, when the snake moves without eating, the length stays the same, but the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> For example, snake of length 4: positions A (head), B, C, D (tail).\n> \n> Move to new head E, then new positions: E (head), A, B, C. D is removed. So length is still 4, but D is gone.\n> \n> Similarly here, initial: 14 segments: let's call P0 to P13.\n> \n> After move to new cell Q, new positions: Q (head), P0, P1, P2, ..., P12. P13 is removed.\n> \n> So new snake has Q, P0, P1, ..., P12, which is 14 segments? Q and P0 to P12 is 13 segments? P0 to P12 is 13 positions, plus Q is 14.\n> \n> P0 to P12 is 13 positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P12 is 13 items.\n> \n> Indices from 0 to 12 inclusive is 13 positions.\n> \n> Initial: positions 0 to 13, 14 positions.\n> \n> After move: new head at, say, (5,2)\n> \n> New position 0: (5,2)\n> \n> New position 1: old position 0 (6,2)\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1 (6,3)\n> \n> New position 3: old position 2 (6,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position 13: old position 12 (5,3)\n> \n> Old position 13 (5,2) is not part of new snake; it's vacated.\n> \n> New positions: 0 to 13, 14 positions, but old position 13 is replaced by new head at the same cell? No, new head is at (5,2), which was old position 13, but in new positions, it's new head, and the body is old 0 to 12.\n> \n> So the cell (5,2) is now head, and old position 13 is gone, so no issue.\n> \n> For collision: when moving to (5,2), which is current tail, it is safe because after the move, that cell is head, and the tail has moved.\n> \n> Back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (6,2), with direction D:\n> \n> - Move L to (5,2): safe, as it's the tail.\n> \n> - Move D to (6,3): but (6,3) is a body segment, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - Move R to (7,2): wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Move U to (6,1): not allowed because opposite direction.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,2).\n> \n> But is (6,1) a valid cell? y=1, x=6, is it within bounds? Walls: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so (6,1) is on the grid, but moving U is not allowed due to direction.\n> \n> So for turn 64, I must move L to (5,2).\n> \n> But let's confirm the food at (6,3): there is food at (6,3) with life 10, value 1.\n> \n> But (6,3) is currently occupied by snake body, index 1. So I cannot eat it now because the head is not on it, and the body is there. Rule: food can be under body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (6,3) food, since it's under body, I need to move the body away first, then head can eat it later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But for turn 64, I have no choice but to move L to (5,2).\n> \n> Then, after that, head is at (5,2), and direction was D, but after moving L, the new direction is L.\n> \n> Then for turn 65, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7 all y; y=0, y=7 all x.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn 65:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions (head first): [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n  - Current direction: Left (L)\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,1): value +1, life span 4\n  - (1,1): value +1, life span 6\n  - (6,3): value +1, life span 9\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 65\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2), moving left (L). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is currently the tail of the snake. Moving here is safe because the tail will move away unless we eat food (which we're not here).\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is not a wall or part of the snake's body (other than the tail), so it's safe.\n3. **Left (L)**: (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is an internal obstacle (wall), so this move would cause a collision.\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,2)\n   - (6,2) is the first body segment after the head, so moving here would cause a collision. Also, moving right is the opposite of the current left direction, which is not allowed (\"no instant reverse\").\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **Up (U)** and **Down (D)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Move Up (U) to (5,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3)\n- **New Direction**: Up (U)\n- **Body Movement**:\n  - The tail (5,3) moves away, so no collision.\n  - The new body segments will follow the head's previous positions.\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (5,3), direction U:\n    - U to (5,4): (5,4) is a body segment (from initial positions), so collision.\n    - D to (5,2): Opposite of current direction (U), not allowed.\n    - L to (4,3): (4,3) is the new tail (after movement), safe.\n    - R to (6,3): (6,3) is a body segment, collision.\n  - Only safe move: L to (4,3).\n\nThis path seems restrictive, leading us to move left to the tail repeatedly, which might not be optimal for accessing food.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,1)\n- **New Direction**: Down (D)\n- **Body Movement**:\n  - (5,1) is free, so no collision.\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (5,1), direction D:\n    - U to (5,2): Opposite of current direction (D), not allowed.\n    - D to (5,0): y=0 is a wall, collision.\n    - L to (4,1): (4,1) is a wall, collision.\n    - R to (6,1): (6,1) has food, and is free.\n  - Only safe move: R to (6,1) to eat the food.\n\nEating at (6,1):\n- **New Head Position**: (6,1)\n- **Snake Growth**: Length increases by 1 (new tail stays at (4,3)).\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (6,1), direction R:\n    - U to (6,2): (6,2) is a body segment, collision.\n    - D to (6,0): y=0 is a wall, collision.\n    - L to (5,1): (5,1) is a body segment, collision.\n    - R to (7,1): x=7 is a wall, collision.\n  - All moves lead to death on the next turn.\n\nThis path leads to immediate death after eating the food, which is not desirable.\n\n### Choosing the Safer Path\n\nGiven that moving Down (D) leads to certain death after eating, the safer option is to move Up (U) to (5,3), even though it's restrictive. This avoids immediate death and keeps the snake alive longer, allowing for potential future opportunities to access other food items like (6,3) once the snake's body moves away from it.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 65\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No.\n> \n> Typically, when snake grows, the tail position remains, and a new segment is added there, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1) and eating:\n> \n> - Head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,1)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,2)  // previous segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,2)  // previous segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (6,3)  // previous segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (6,4)  // previous segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,4)  // previous segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,5)  // previous segment 6\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,5)  // previous segment 7\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,5)  // previous segment 8\n> \n> - Segment 10: (3,4)  // previous segment 9\n> \n> - Segment 11: (2,4)  // previous segment 10\n> \n> - Segment 12: (2,3)  // previous segment 11\n> \n> - Segment 13: (3,3)  // previous segment 12\n> \n> - Segment 14: (4,3)  // previous segment 13 (tail)\n> \n> But since we ate food, we add a new segment at the tail position, so tail is still at (4,3), but now it's segment 14, and we have segment 15 at (4,3)? No.\n> \n> When eating, the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and we add a new segment at the same position, but that doesn't make sense; usually, the snake grows by keeping the tail in place and adding a new head, so the length increases.\n> \n> After move without eating: head new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one before, tail leaves.\n> \n> With eating: head new position, each segment moves to previous position, but tail stays, so the position that was tail is now occupied by the new tail, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move to (6,1) and eat:\n> \n> - The new head is at (6,1)\n> \n> - The previous head (5,1) is now segment 1\n> \n> - Previous segment 1 (5,2) is now segment 2\n> \n> - Previous segment 2 (6,2) is now segment 3\n> \n> - ...\n> - Up to previous segment 13 (4,3) which was tail, now it is segment 14\n> \n> - But since we ate, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so segment 15 at (4,3)? No, the tail position remains occupied by the tail segment, but since we grow, the tail doesn't advance, so the new tail is at the same position as before, but now it's part of the body, and the tail is extended.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: the snake has 14 segments before eating. After eating, we have 15 segments. The positions are the same as after the move, but with the tail position repeated or something.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,1) without eating: positions would be head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), ..., up to (4,3) as tail, 14 positions.\n> \n> With eating, we keep the tail position, so positions are: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), and tail at (4,3). So the tail is at (4,3), and there are 15 segments.\n> \n> From the list: segments 1 to 14 are as above, and segment 15 is the new tail at (4,3).\n> \n> In the sequence: after move and eat, the body includes all previous positions except the tail moved, but with growth, tail stays.\n> \n> Positions: the head is at new position (6,1), the first body segment is at previous head position (5,1), second at previous first body (5,2), and so on, up to the 14th body segment at previous tail position (4,3), and since we ate, the tail does not move, so the 15th segment is added at (4,3), but that would be two segments at (4,3), which is wrong.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when the head eats food, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions A (head), B, C, ..., Y (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to new position Z (food), so new positions: Z (head), A, B, C, ..., Y.

It's turn 66. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2).

So the snake has 14 segments. Head direction is Up, which is (x,y+1). Since it's moving Up, from (5,3) to... let's see the positions: head (5,3), then (5,2) which is down, but head direction is U, so the previous move was Up? Positions are listed head first: (5,3) is head, then (5,2) is the next segment, which is directly below, so the snake was moving Down to get to (5,2)? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction U, meaning it just moved Up to (5,3). But the next segment is (5,2), which is south of (5,3). (5,2) is y=2, (5,3) is y=3, so (5,2) is below (5,3). Since the snake moves one cell per turn, and positions are head first, the segment after head is where the head was last turn.\n> \n> So, at turn 65, head was at (5,2), and it moved Up to (5,3) at turn 66.

Snake has a segment at (6,3)? Positions: (6,3) is the fourth segment: head (5,3), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). So (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body. But food at (6,3) is present? Food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is below, and (1,1) is top-left.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,1), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn. So at turn 66, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 68? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=3 at turn t, it decreases to 2 at turn t+1, to 1 at turn t+2, and gone at turn t+3. So it exists for L turns including the current one.\n> \n> At turn 66, food at (6,1) has life span 3, so it exists on turns 66, 67, 68; gone at turn 69.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 5: exists turns 66,67,68,69,70; gone at 71.\n> \n> (6,3) life span 8: exists turns 66 to 73.\n> \n> But (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body, so it can't be eaten immediately.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (4,6) : x=4,y=6\n> \n> - (1,2) : x=1,y=2\n> \n> - (1,5) : x=1,y=5\n> \n> - (4,1) : x=4,y=1\n> \n> - (2,6) : x=2,y=6\n> \n> - (1,4) : x=1,y=4\n> \n> - (5,6) : x=5,y=6\n> \n> - (4,2) : x=4,y=2\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse.

Specifically, (6,3) is the fifth segment, so it's occupied. But food can spawn under the body, as per the rules.

Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and no food, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> So new positions: new head at (2,3), then the previous head (3,3) becomes neck, and so on, up to the second last body segment, which is (2,4) at index 12, and the tail (2,3) is gone, but new head is at (2,3), so (2,3) is occupied by head now, and (2,4) is the new tail.\n> \n> List: after move L to (2,3):\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Then: previous head (3,3)\n> \n> - Then: (4,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (6,2)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - And the previous tail (2,3) is removed, but since head moved there, it's fine, and the segment before tail was (2,4), which is now the last, so new tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Positions: from index 0: (3,3) head, after move, new head at (2,3), then the rest: indices 0 to 12 become the body, so (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to (2,4), and index 13 (2,3) is gone.\n> \n> Index 12 is (2,4), index 13 is (2,3).\n> \n> After move: new head at (2,3), then the first body segment is the old head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), and then (2,4) is now the tail, since the last segment (2,3) is no longer part of the snake; it's now the head position.\n> \n> So new snake: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Now, (2,3) was the tail, but now it's head, and (2,4) is new tail.\n> \n> If I had eaten food, the tail wouldn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, no food at (2,3), I think.

It's turn 69. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: since borders are x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, that means it's an 8x8 grid, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are on the borders and those internal points.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (4,1) and (4,2) are listed, and (4,6), (5,6), etc.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,2), then body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). That's 14 segments? Let me count: positions from head to tail: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). That's 14 positions, so snake length is 14.\n> \n> Head direction is down, which is D. Since head is at (3,2) and direction D, that means it moved down to (3,2) from previous position? Head direction is the direction it's facing, so it came from above? Positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), which is directly above, since y increases? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom, but here it says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upward, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,2), next is (3,3). Since head is at (3,2) and next is (3,3), which has higher y, so y=3 > y=2, so y increases upward? U is (x,y+1), so if y increases upward, U is up, which makes sense. D is (x,y-1), down, L and R left and right.\n> \n> In positions, head (3,2), body (3,3), so since body is at (3,3), which is above (3,2), and head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to (3,2) from (3,3)? That can't be right because (3,3) is the body segment after head.\n> \n> The positions are listed from head to tail. So head is first: (3,2). Then the segment behind it is (3,3). Since head is at (3,2) and behind is (3,3), that means the snake was moving downward to reach (3,2) from (3,3)? No.\n> \n> If head is at (3,2) and the next segment is (3,3), that means the head moved to (3,2) from some previous position, and the segment that was behind is now at (3,3).\n> \n> Typically, in snake, the head moves, and the body follows. So at turn t, positions: head at (x,y), then body segments.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction the head is facing, i.e., the direction it moved to get to its current position.\n> \n> In this case, head at (3,2), direction D (down). So it moved down to (3,2). Therefore, before moving, it was at (3,3), and it moved down to (3,2). Then the body segments follow: after head, (3,3) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position, then (4,3), etc.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So from positions: (3,2) head, then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All are positive food since value is 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 69, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 71? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span N, then on turn t, countdown is N, on turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., on turn t + N - 1, countdown 1, then after that, gone, so it exists for turns t to t + N - 1 inclusive? I think I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the turn it is present, countdown starts at N. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N turns.\n> \n> Better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t. At the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If L-1 > 0, it remains for next turn, else it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for eating: if head moves to food cell during turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 69:\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): life span 3, so present on turns 69,70,71. After turn 71, it disappears.\n> \n> - Food at (6,3): life span 5, present on turns 69,70,71,72,73.\n> \n> - Food at (3,1): life span 8, present on turns 69 to 76.\n> \n> All have value 1, so positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid with walls and snake.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> List:\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are listed separately, but (1,4) is in internal obstacles, yes.\n> \n> Also (4,1) and (4,2) are walls.\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, down. So from (3,3) to (3,2), moved down.\n> \n> Current possible moves: since head at (3,2), direction D, so it can move to adjacent cells except opposite direction, which would be U, but since no instant reverse, cannot move up to (3,3) because that's opposite to current direction D.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning it just moved down, so it cannot move up on next turn because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: from (3,2), it can move:\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) but y-1, (3,2-1) = (3,1)\n> \n> - Left: (2,2)\n> \n> - Right: (4,2)\n> \n> But not up to (3,3) because reverse.\n> \n> Now, check walls and body.\n> \n> First, (3,1): is it wall? Internal obstacles: (4,1) and (4,2), but (3,1) not listed, and borders: y=0 is bottom, so (3,1) is not border unless y=1 is border? y=0 is border, y=7 is border, so y=1 is not border. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 border, so (3,1) is empty? But is it a wall cell?\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,1) has x=3 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,1), (4,2), etc., but (3,1) not in the list, so (3,1) should be free, but there might be food or something.\n> \n> Food: (3,1) has food! Food at (3,1) with life span 8.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) has food, (6,3) has food.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is a possible move down.\n> \n> But (3,1) has food, and it's positive.\n> \n> Now, moving to (3,1) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> But is it safe? Need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: (3,1) is not a wall, as above.\n> \n> Body collision: snake body positions: (3,2) is head, so not body yet. Body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> (3,1) is not in this list, so no body there. Also, after moving, the body will shift, but the head moves first, so if it moves to (3,1), and eats food, the tail grows, so new tail is added, but the body segments move: the tail was at (2,4), and after move, head to (3,1), then the body: the segment at (3,2) becomes new body part, and so on, tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, when snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to a cell, it must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, because the tail will move away if no food eaten, but if food eaten, tail stays, so if head moves to tail position, it might collide only if food is eaten there? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it dies, except if that body segment is the tail, and no food is eaten, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But if food is eaten on the tail cell, then the tail doesn't move, and head collides with it.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (3,1), it's not the tail, so should be fine.\n> \n> First, possible actions from (3,2):\n> \n> - Down to (3,1): has food, eat it, snake grows to length 15.\n> \n> - Left to (2,2): check if free.\n> \n> (2,2): walls? Not border, not internal obstacle (internal has (1,2) but not (2,2), so free. Body? Positions: not in list, so free. No food, I think.\n> \n> - Right to (4,2): but (4,2) is an internal obstacle! Internal obstacles include (4,2), which is a wall. So (4,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (3,1) - has food, not wall, not body.\n> \n> - L: (2,2) - no food, not wall, not body.\n> \n> - R: (4,2) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> - U: (3,3) but reverse direction, not allowed since current direction D.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Down or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move down to (3,1), I eat the food, grow to 15, and the food at (3,1) is consumed.\n> \n> Then, head at (3,1), and direction would be D, since I moved down.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: from (3,1), direction D.\n> \n> Cannot move up to (3,2) reverse.\n> \n> Can move: down to (3,0), but y=0 is border wall, so cannot.\n> \n> Left to (2,1)\n> \n> Right to (4,1), but (4,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n> \n> So only possible: Left to (2,1)\n> \n> (2,1): not border, not wall (walls: (1,2) but not (2,1)), no body? After move, snake positions: head to (3,1), then body: previous head (3,2) becomes first body, then (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to tail (2,4). When food eaten, a new segment added at tail, so positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), and new tail at (2,4)? Tail position: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail (2,4) stays, and new head at (3,1), so the body includes (2,4) still, but (2,4) is the second last or what?\n> \n> After moving and eating: head moves to (3,1), which was empty. Then, since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the body segments: the segment that was at position 1 (old head) moves to new position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it. So the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on, down to the tail. If no food eaten, tail moves away from its position. If food eaten, tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions: let’s say before move: head at H, body segments at B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail at T.\n> \n> After move to new cell N:\n> \n> - If no food at N, head to N, B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., T to previous position of second last segment.

The positions: head at N, then B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., T at old T, and since food eaten, T doesn't move, so the segment that was at T remains, and the body has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions: head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (3,1) and eating food:\n> \n> - Head to (3,1)\n> \n> - The first body segment moves to old head position (3,2)\n> \n> - Second body segment moves to old first body position (3,3)\n> \n> - And so on: (4,3) to (4,3)?

But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, and it's at (3,1), so moving to (3,2) which has higher y, so down increases y, meaning y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, U would decrease y, D increase y, L decrease x, R increase x.\n> \n> In the food, (1,1) is top-left if (0,0) is top-left? (0,0) is wall, so (1,1) is row 1, column 1.\n> \n> But let's confirm with snake: head at (3,1), body at (3,2), so (3,2) is below (3,1) since moving down to it.\n> \n> Then (3,3) below that, then to (4,3) right, then (5,3) right, then to (5,2) up? (5,3) to (5,2) is decreasing y, so up, but head was moving down? Sequence is positions, not movements between.\n> \n> The positions list: from head to tail.\n> \n> Head: (3,1) — current position.\n> \n> Then next segment: (3,2) — so from head to this segment, it was moving down to (3,2) at some point, but now the snake is stationary except for movement.\n> \n> Current state, snake is at these positions, head at (3,1), and it was moving down, so last move was into (3,1) from above? Previous head position.\n> \n> Since direction is D, and head at (3,1), it must have come from (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so that can't be. Mistake.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is invalid. How did it get to (3,1)?\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current moving direction, meaning it is facing down, so it can move to (3,2).\n> \n> But from the positions, head is at (3,1), and next is (3,2), so the body is connected, meaning the snake was previously at (3,0) but (3,0) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> y=0 is border wall, so (3,0) is not accessible. But snake has segment at (3,1), which is adjacent to wall? (3,1) has y=1, not 0, so it's on row y=1.\n> \n> Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,1) head\n> \n> 1: (3,2)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (4,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,2)\n> \n> 6: (6,2)\n> \n> 7: (6,3)\n> \n> 8: (6,4)\n> \n> 9: (5,4)\n> \n> 10: (5,5)\n> \n> 11: (4,5)\n> \n> 12: (3,5)\n> \n> 13: (3,4)\n> \n> 14: (2,4) tail\n> \n> From (3,1) to (3,2): if head is at (3,1) and moving down to (3,2), but (3,2) is the next segment, so the head is about to move away from (3,1) to a new position.\n> \n> In snake game, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail follows.\n> \n> Current positions are before movement on turn 70.\n> \n> At the start of turn 70, snake is at these positions, head at (3,1), and it is facing down, so it can choose to move down to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently occupied by the body, so if it moves down, it would collide with its own body, unless that body segment moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves, the head moves to an adjacent cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its current cell.\n> \n> So at turn 70, before moving, head is at (3,1), and the cell (3,2) is occupied by the first body segment. If the snake moves down to (3,2), that cell will be vacated by the body segment moving to where the head was, but since the head is moving to (3,2), which is about to be vacated, it's ok, no collision, because the body moves at the same time.\n> \n> The rule is: moving into a cell that will be vacated by the tail is allowed, but moving into a body cell that is not the tail is collision.\n> \n> Specifically, from the core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for any move, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away. But if occupied by any other body segment, it's collision.\n> \n> Also, walls.\n> \n> In this case, for moving down from (3,1) to (3,2): (3,2) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail; the tail is at (2,4). So (3,2) is a body segment that will not move away immediately? When the head moves down to (3,2), the body segment at (3,2) will move to (3,1), which is the old head position. So the cell (3,2) is vacated by the body segment as it moves to (3,1), and the head moves to (3,2), so it's fine, no collision, because the body is moving away.\n> \n> Similarly, for the tail: if head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Only if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail and that segment is not moving away from that cell, but in the chain, all body segments move to the next position, so the only cell that might be an issue is the tail if it's not moving, but it does move.\n> \n> The key point is: after movement, the new head position should not be the same as any body segment position except that the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In code, it's easier: when moving, the new head position is checked against all current body positions except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> From the rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> For other body segments, if the head moves there, it collides because that segment is still there.\n> \n> In this case, for move down to (3,2): (3,2) is currently occupied by body segment at index 1, which is not the tail. When the head moves to (3,2), at the same time, the body segment at (3,2) will move to (3,1), so the cell (3,2) is only occupied by the head after movement, and the body is elsewhere. So no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if the head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves to the previous position, so the head can occupy that cell safely.\n> \n> Collision only if the new head position is a wall or a body cell that is not the tail and will not be vacated, but since all body segments move, only the tail cell is special because it's vacated, other body cells are occupied until they move, but in the movement step, they move simultaneously.\n> \n> Standard implementation: the head moves first to new position, then each body segment shifts to the previous position, so the tail is removed. Then if the new head position was the tail position, it's fine because the tail left.\n> \n> If the new head position is any other body position, it's collision because that body segment is still there when head arrives.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell that is currently body (not tail), after movement, that cell has both head and body? No, the body moves to the old head position, so the new head position is vacated before the head moves there? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At time t, positions: head at H, body segments at B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail at T.\n> \n> When moving direction D:\n> \n> - New head position N = adjacent in direction D.\n> \n> - If N is wall or a body cell (including B1 to Bk and T), but with exception for T: if N == T, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> - After move, new positions: head at N, B1 moves to H, B2 moves to old B1, ..., tail moves to old second last.\n> \n> So the cell N: if N was T, it's fine because T moves away.\n> \n> If N was some Bi, then after move, Bi moves to H, so cell N is now head, and no longer Bi, so it should be fine? But Bi was at N, but now Bi has moved to H, so N is empty when head moves there? In terms of grid, during the move, the head moves to N, and simultaneously, all body segments move to their next position.\n> \n> So if N was occupied by a body segment, say Bi, then when head moves to N, Bi is moving to its new position, so the cell N is only occupied by head after the move, no conflict.\n> \n> But the rule says body collision if head touches any body segment, meaning after movement, the head position should not be the same as any body segment position.\n> \n> After movement, new head at N, body segments at old head position for B1, old B1 for B2, etc., down to old second last for tail.\n> \n> So the new positions are: head: N, segment1: old head, segment2: old segment1, ..., tail: old second last.\n> \n> Therefore, for no collision, N should not be equal to any of the new body positions except it can be equal to the old tail position if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, N can be old tail position, but N cannot be any other old body position because after move, that position is still occupied by a body segment (the one that moved there).\n> \n> For example, if N is old B1 position, then after move, segment1 is at old head, segment2 is at old B1, which is N, so N has both head and segment2? No: head is at N, and segment2 is at old B1, which is N, so position N has two things, collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the issue.\n> \n> If the new head position N is equal to the current position of any body segment except the tail, then after movement, that body segment moves to a different cell, but the cell N will be occupied by the head and possibly another body segment if N was not the tail.\n> \n> Let P be the current positions.\n> \n> After move in direction D, new head N.\n> \n> New body positions: B1' = P_head, B2' = P_B1, ..., Bk' = P_{Bk-1}, tail' = P_{second last}\n> \n> The new positions set is {N, P_head, P_B1, ..., P_{second last}}\n> \n> For no collision, N must not be in {P_B1, P_B2, ..., P_tail} except that if N == P_tail, it is allowed because P_tail is not in the new positions (since tail moved to P_second last).\n> \n> If N == P_Bi for some i, then in new positions, N is head position, and P_Bi is also the position of some body segment, e.g., if N = P_B1, then B2' = P_B1 = N, so position N has head and B2', collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if N = P_tail, then new positions: head at N, tail at P_second last, so no duplicate.\n> \n> Also, N cannot be wall.\n> \n> Back to the current state.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction D, so possible moves: since direction is D, it can move U, D, L, R but not opposite, which would be U, since D is down, opposite is U, so cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move opposite, which is U (up).\n> \n> So allowed moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells from (3,1):\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) - currently occupied by body segment (3,2)\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) - what is here?

New head at (3,2), and segment2 moves to old segment1 position which is (3,2), so yes, both at (3,2), collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving down to (3,2) would cause collision because (3,2) is a body cell that is not the tail, and after move, it is occupied by both head and the body segment that moved there.\n> \n> Specifically, segment2 moves to (3,2), which is where head is, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for any move to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will cause collision because that body segment moves to a new position, but the cell it left might be taken by head, but in this case, for the cell that was occupied, if it's not the tail, the body segment moving to it is different.\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment (except tail) is deadly, because after movement, that cell will be occupied by the head and the body segment that moves there (which is the next segment).\n> \n> Moving to tail is safe if tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is not tail, tail is at (2,4), so moving to (3,2) is deadly collision.\n> \n> Left to (2,1): (2,1) is free?

It's turn 71. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive. Walls are at the borders and those internal points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,1), then body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So the tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So for food at (1,1), life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, turn 71. If not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1 for each, and it says \"value1, life_span1\" etc., so (1,1,1,1) probably means position (1,1), value 1, life span 1. Similarly, (6,3,3,1) might be position (6,3), value 1? No, the format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), so for (1,1,1,1), that should be (x,y) = (1,1), value=1, life_span=1. Similarly, (6,3,3,1) is (x,y)=(6,3), value=3? But it says \"value and life span\", and in the description, it says positive food +1, negative food -1, but here all values are positive? Let me read.\n> \n> In the food list: it says ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) so for first one: ( (1,1), 1, 1 ) so value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Second: ( (6,3), 3, 1 )? No, it says \"(6, 3, 3, 1)\" – this might be a tuple. Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 1, 1, 1) - (6, 3, 3, 1) - (3, 4, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's listed as (x, y, value, life_span). So:\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - Food at (6,3): value=3, life_span=1? It says (6,3,3,1), so value=3? But the core rules say positive food +1, negative -1, but here value=3? That might be a special case or something. Let me check the rules.\n> \n> In core rules, it says: Positive Food: Reward Value = +1, Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1. But here, for (6,3), it's value=3? And for (3,4), value=9? That doesn't match.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. The input says: \"(1, 1, 1, 1)\" which might be x=1,y=1,value=1,life_span=1; \"(6, 3, 3, 1)\" x=6,y=3,value=3,life_span=1? But life_span=1 for both? No, (3,4,9,1) value=9, life_span=1.\n> \n> But life_span: for (1,1) life_span=1, (6,3) life_span=1, (3,4) life_span=1? But it says life_span1 for all, but (6,3,3,1) and (3,4,9,1), so life_span is the last number, so all have life_span=1? That can't be right because for (3,4) it says 9,1 so value=9, life_span=1.\n> \n> But the rules say food disappears after N turns, so with life_span=1, all food will disappear after this turn if not eaten now? But that seems odd.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span N, it will disappear after N turns from when it spawned, I assume. But here, at turn 71, we have the current life_span given.\n> \n> For food at (1,1): life_span=1, meaning it has 1 turn left, so after turn 71, it disappears. Similarly, (6,3) life_span=1, disappears after turn 71. (3,4) life_span=9, so it has 9 turns left, disappears after turn 71+9-1 or something? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span is L, it means after L turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases each turn, at turn t, if L=1, it will be gone after this turn, so must be eaten this turn to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, for L=9, it has 9 turns including current, so it will disappear after turn 79.\n> \n> But for (3,4), value=9? That seems high, but possible. Core rules say positive food +1, but here values are given as 1,3,9, so I think we have to go with the input; perhaps some food has higher values.\n> \n> The core rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food, but in the input, values are different, so I should use the values as given. Similarly for negative, but here all values are positive: 1,3,9 all >0, so all positive food.\n> \n> (1,1): value=1, life=1\n> \n> (6,3): value=3, life=1\n> \n> (3,4): value=9, life=9\n> \n> Life span: for (3,4), life=9, so it has 9 turns left.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,1), direction L, so last move was left to (2,1) from (3,1)? Snake positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), ...] so from (3,1) to (2,1), so moved left, direction L.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because reverse is not allowed. No instant reverse, so cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right). Can move U (up), D (down), or L (left).\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Also, food at (1,1), (6,3), (3,4)\n> \n> But (3,4) is occupied by the snake!

So (3,4) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is listed, but the snake is on it.

It's turn 72, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So I have to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: the head is at (2,2), and the body segments follow: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). The head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards, so from (2,2), it came from below, probably from (2,1).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - One at (6,3) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - Another at (3,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (also positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned, so both are good to eat, but I need to be careful with risks.\n> \n> The food at (6,3) has a short life span of 3 turns, meaning it will disappear after turn 72 + 3 = turn 75. Since it's turn 72 now, after this turn, life span decreases to 2, then to 1 on turn 73, and it disappears after turn 74 or something? Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,3) with life_span=3 on turn 72:\n> \n> - On turn 72, countdown is 3\n> \n> - After turn 72, it decreases to 2 (so available until after turn 72?)\n> \n> I need to be precise. Let's say at the start of turn 72, life_span is 3. After the snake moves on turn 72, if it eats it, great; if not, at the end of turn 72, life_span decreases to 2. Similarly, after turn 73, to 1, and after turn 74, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turns 72, 73, 74? But since countdown decreases after each turn, including current, it might be that on the turn when countdown is 1, after eating or not, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the food is present for N turns starting from when it was spawned. But here, it's given at turn 72 with life_span, so:\n> \n> - At turn 72, life_span=3, so it can be eaten on turn 72.\n> \n> - After turn 72, if not eaten, life_span becomes 2, so available on turn 73.\n> \n> - After turn 73, life_span becomes 1, available on turn 74.\n> \n> - After turn 74, life_span becomes 0, and it disappears, so not available on turn 75 or later.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food at (3,4) with life_span=8, it will be around for many turns.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,2), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> Since head direction is Up, I cannot move Down immediately because that would be a reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down.\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so I cannot choose Down on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 72: Up, Left, or Right.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so coordinates from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But there are internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - Border: x=0 or x=7 for any y, y=0 or y=7 for any x. But since grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, that's 8x8 grid? x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y.\n> \n> x=0 to 7 means 8 columns: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n> \n> Similarly y=0 to 7, 8 rows.\n> \n> But walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7? No, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are already covered, so (x,0) for x=1 to 6, similarly (x,7) for x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0: all x, but x=0 and x=7 are border, so cells (1,0), (2,0), ..., (6,0) are walls.\n> \n> Similarly y=7: (1,7), (2,7), ..., (6,7) walls.\n> \n> x=0: (0,1) to (0,6) walls, but (0,0) and (0,7) are corners, also walls.\n> \n> Similarly x=7.\n> \n> Plus internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is listed, but let's see snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> (2,1) is at y=1, which is not y=0, so not wall, but (2,1) is snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is an internal obstacle, so wall.\n> \n> List all wall cells for clarity:\n> \n> - Border walls:\n> \n> - Bottom row y=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)\n> \n> - Top row y=7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)\n> \n> - Left column x=0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)  [ (0,0) and (0,7) already covered]\n> \n> - Right column x=7: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is listed as internal obstacle, but in snake positions, (3,2) is body, (4,3) is body, etc., but (4,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is wall, (1,2) is wall, etc.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,3) and (3,4).\n> \n> (6,3): let's see, in snake positions, (6,3) is a body segment? Snake positions: ... (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), ... so (6,3) is occupied by snake body.

(2,3) not listed, and not border, so should be free? But snake body: positions include (3,3), (4,3), etc., not (2,3). Snake has (3,3) but not (2,3), so (2,3) is empty? Snake positions: from head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), so (2,3) is not occupied, I think. List: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), etc. So (2,3) is not in the list, so it should be free. Walls: (2,3) is not a wall cell, so moving Up to (2,3) should be possible.\n> \n> - Left to (1,2): (1,2) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right to (3,2): (3,2) is snake body, segment 3, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 72, only possible move is Up to (2,3), since Left is wall, Right is body, Down is invalid reverse.\n> \n> Down is invalid because reverse not allowed, and also (2,1) is body.\n> \n> So only choice is Up to (2,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Head direction is Up, so from (2,2) to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will have new head at (2,3), and tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food at (2,3), I assume, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Current food: at (6,3) and (3,4), not at (2,3).\n> \n> So after moving Up, new snake: head at (2,3), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), etc., and the last segment, (3,5) is tail and is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: new positions: head to (2,3), then the rest: the old positions without tail.\n> \n> Old positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3), the body segments: segment 1: (2,2) becomes body, segment 2: (2,1), segment 3: (3,1), segment 4: (3,2), segment 5: (3,3), segment 6: (4,3), segment 7: (5,3), segment 8: (5,2), segment 9: (6,2), segment 10: (6,3), segment 11: (6,4), segment 12: (5,4), segment 13: (5,5), segment 14: (4,5), and tail (3,5) is removed, so not included.\n> \n> So new snake: [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] and length same, since no food.\n> \n> Now, head direction was Up, but after moving to (2,3), the new direction depends on the move.

New positions: after move, segments: head (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> So (6,3) is occupied by segment 11?

The cell C remains occupied.\n> \n> The only time a cell is vacated is when the tail is removed or when a segment moves away from a cell that is not immediately occupied by another segment, but in a snake, when it moves straight, cells are vacated only at the tail end.\n> \n> For example, if the snake is moving in a straight line, each move, the head moves forward, tail is removed, so the tail cell is vacated, and all other cells remain occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,3), it is not the tail, so it will remain occupied until the tail passes that point, which might take many turns.\n> \n> To vacate (6,3), the segment that is there must move away, which happens when the snake turns or moves, but in the shift, it moves to the next position.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,3) will move to the position of the next segment in the direction of movement.\n> \n> But in this case, since the snake is not moving in a straight line, it's bent.\n> \n> From the positions, the snake has a turn at (5,2) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4), so from (5,2) to (6,2) is Right, then (6,2) to (6,3) is Up, then (6,3) to (6,4) is Up, so at (6,3), it's part of a vertical segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if the head moves, the body shifts, so the segment that was at (6,3) will move to where the next segment was, which is (6,4), so it leaves (6,3) and moves to (6,4), and the cell (6,3) is then occupied by the segment that was before it, which was at (6,2), so it becomes (6,2) moving to (6,3), so (6,3) is now occupied by that segment.\n> \n> So the cell (6,3) is never vacated; it just has a different segment on it after each move.\n> \n> For the food to be accessible, the body must move away from that cell, meaning that on some turn, when the snake moves, no segment is at (6,3), which only happens if that cell is not occupied after the move.\n> \n> But in a snake, when it moves, cells are only vacated at the tail position if no food eaten.\n> \n> For a body cell to be vacated, it must be that the tail is at that cell and it moves away, or the snake turns in a way that the cell is left empty.\n> \n> But in this case, (6,3) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,5), far away.\n> \n> So to vacate (6,3), the snake must move in such a way that the segment at (6,3) moves and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the body is connected, when a segment moves, the previous segment moves to its position, so the cell is always occupied until the tail passes by.\n> \n> The only way to vacate a body-occupied cell is for the tail to be at that cell and then move away, leaving it empty.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is at (6,3), and the snake moves, the tail moves to the next position, and (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> But currently, (6,3) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5), and to move the tail to (6,3), it would take many turns, and by then the food may have expired.\n> \n> Life span is short, only 3 turns left including current.\n> \n> On turn 72, (6,3) is occupied, so cannot eat.\n> \n> On turn 73, after move, (6,3) is still occupied, as above.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 74, same thing.\n> \n> So it might be impossible to eat the food at (6,3) because it's under the body and the snake can't vacate it in time.\n> \n> Let's see the position of (6,3) in the snake.\n> \n> After turn 72 move, (6,3) is seg 10, and there are 15 segments, so tail is seg 14 at (4,5).\n> \n> The distance from head to this segment is 10 steps, but to move the tail to (6,3), it would take many moves.\n> \n> For example, each move, the tail moves one step closer to the head in terms of position, but the cell (6,3) will be vacated only when the segment that is there becomes the tail and then moves away.\n> \n> Currently, seg 10 is at (6,3). When will this segment become the tail? When 4 segments are removed, but since no food, each move removes one segment from the tail, so after 4 moves, seg 10 will be the new tail, but let's see.\n> \n> After turn 72, positions as above, seg 10 at (6,3).\n> \n> After turn 73 move: new positions, seg 11 is at old seg 10, which is (6,3), so now seg 11 at (6,3).\n> \n> After turn 74 move: new seg 12 at old seg 11, which is (6,3), so seg 12 at (6,3).\n> \n> After turn 75 move: new seg 13 at old seg 12, but old seg 12 is at (6,4) or something, let's not detail.\n> \n> Actually, the index increases, but the cell (6,3) is occupied by different segments each time, but the cell remains occupied until the tail reaches that point.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5), and the path to (6,3) is not direct, but the number of segments between head and (6,3) is 10, so it will take at least 10 moves for the tail to reach (6,3), but by then the food is gone.\n> \n> Life span: on turn 72, life span 3, after turn 72, life span 2 for turn 73, after turn 73, life span 1 for turn 74, after turn 74, life span 0, gone. So can be eaten only on turn 72,73,74.\n> \n> But on all these turns, (6,3) is occupied by body, so head cannot move there, and even if it could, it would collide.\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat the food at (6,3) because it's under the body and the snake can't free the cell in time with the short life span.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore that food and focus on the other food at (3,4) which has long life span.\n> \n> Also, there might be other opportunities.\n> \n> But for now, on turn 72, I have to move Up to (2,3) as only choice.\n> \n> Then on turn 73, head at (2,3), direction Up.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> But direction is Up, so cannot move Down (reverse).\n> \n> Also, check surroundings:\n> \n> - Up to (2,4): is it free?

It's turn 73. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, these are additional walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). That's 15 segments. Head is at (2,3), and direction is U (up), which means moving towards increasing y, I assume? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically, in grid systems, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is U, and positions are given, let's plot this.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (2,3)\n> \n> 2. (2,2)\n> \n> 3. (2,1)\n> \n> 4. (3,1)\n> \n> 5. (3,2)\n> \n> 6. (3,3)\n> \n> 7. (4,3)\n> \n> 8. (5,3)\n> \n> 9. (5,2)\n> \n> 10. (6,2)\n> \n> 11. (6,3)\n> \n> 12. (6,4)\n> \n> 13. (5,4)\n> \n> 14. (5,5)\n> \n> 15. (4,5)  // tail\n> \n> Direction is U, which is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y. So, if (0,0) is bottom-left, then up increases y; if top-left, up decreases y. But in the position list, from head (2,3) to previous positions: (2,2) is below if y increases down? I need to assume a coordinate system.\n> \n> Looking at positions: (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) etc. Since direction is U, and head is at (2,3), moving U would be to (2,4), I think.\n> \n> The definition: U is (x,y+1), so if y increases upwards, (x,y+1) is up. But in the sequence, from (2,3) to (2,2), that must be down, so probably y increases downwards? Let's see the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as U, but the previous move must have been from (2,2) to (2,3), which is +y, so if U is (x,y+1), then (2,2) to (2,3) is U, so y+1 is up. Therefore, (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? (7,7) is top-right if y increases up.\n> \n> But in positions, (2,1) to (3,1) is right, then (3,1) to (3,2) is up, etc. So, let's assume (0,0) bottom-left, x right, y up. So U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), direction U, so last move was to (2,3) from (2,2), which is U.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life_span 2\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life_span: for (6,3) is 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 73, life_span 2, so after this turn, it will have 1 turn left, then gone at turn 75? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 73, food at (6,3) has life_span 2, so it is present on turn 73 and 74, gone on turn 75.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) life_span 7, present from 73 to 79, gone 80.\n> \n> (6,2) life_span 10, present from 73 to 82, gone 83.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> First, no instant reverse: since current direction is U, cannot move D next. So cannot go down.\n> \n> Also, cannot move into walls or body, except tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> Border: all (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7, (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7. But since it's cells, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but corners shared.\n> \n> Internal: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So wall cells: all border and these points.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions from (2,3) to (4,5), 15 cells.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), moving U would be to (2,4), which is not occupied by body? Let's see if (2,4) is in snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (2,4) is not in the list, so it's free? But we need to check walls and food.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> First, find adjacent cells to head (2,3):\n> \n> - U: (2,4)\n> \n> - D: (2,2) but (2,2) is the second segment, so body, but since it's the neck, moving down would cause collision? No, because when snake moves, the tail moves, so head can move to where tail was, but only if it's the tail segment.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe.\n> \n> In this case, for move D: (2,2) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, head moves to (2,2), and tail moves from (4,5) to... let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten yet in this move, tail moves, so the cell (2,2) will be vacated by the second segment moving to where head was? Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at position 1 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's index them. Head is index 0: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 1: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 7: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (5,2)\n> \n> Index 9: (6,2)\n> \n> Index 10: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 11: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 12: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 14: (4,5)  // tail\n> \n> If no food eaten, when moving, new head position based on action, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So the tail segment (index 14) is left behind.\n> \n> Specifically: new head position, then position 1 moves to where head was (old position 0), position 2 moves to where position 1 was, and so on, up to position 14 moves to where position 13 was, so the cell of old position 14 is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, after a move without eating, the cells occupied are: new head, and positions 1 to 14 now at old positions 0 to 13 respectively.\n> \n> For collision: when moving head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail (which will move away), it is safe only for the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, for head at (2,3), moving to cell C.\n> \n> If C is occupied by any snake segment except the tail, collision.\n> \n> If C is occupied by the tail, then it is safe because tail will move away.\n> \n> Also, if C has food, it might be eaten.\n> \n> Now, for (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,4)\n> \n> - D: (2,2)\n> \n> - L: (1,3)\n> \n> - R: (3,3)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> First, U: (2,4)\n> \n> Is (2,4) occupied? Snake positions: no (2,4) in list. Walls: (2,4) not in wall list? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7. (2,4) x=2 not 0 or7, y=4 not 0 or7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (4,6),(1,2),(1,5),(4,1),(2,6),(1,4),(5,6),(4,2) — no (2,4), so free. So U is possible.\n> \n> D: (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2) is occupied by index 1, which is not the tail. Tail is at (4,5). So (2,2) is body segment, and since it's not the tail, moving here would cause collision because head would be on a body cell before it moves away. After move, head to (2,2), but at that moment, (2,2) was occupied, so collision. Only if moving to tail position it might be safe, but here (2,2) is not tail. So D is invalid, collision.\n> \n> L: (1,3)\n> \n> (1,3) not in snake positions? Positions: no (1,3). Walls: border, x=0 or7, x=1 not, y=3 not 0 or7. Internal: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — (1,2) and (1,4) are walls, but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free? Internal obstacles given: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — so (1,3) is not mentioned, so not a wall. Also not in snake positions. So L to (1,3) is possible.\n> \n> R: (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied by index 5. Not tail, so collision if move there. Invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4) or L to (1,3). D and R are invalid.\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so if I move U, that's fine, no reverse. If I move L, that's left, not reverse of U, so also fine. Reverse would be D, which is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life_span 2, so must be eaten by turn 74 (since present on 73 and 74).\n> \n> - (3,4) with life_span 7, can be eaten later.\n> \n> - (6,2) with life_span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> But (6,3) is about to disappear soon, only 2 turns left including current.\n> \n> At turn 73, life_span 2, so if not eaten on turn 73, it must be eaten on turn 74, else gone.\n> \n> Similarly, others have more time.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) is currently occupied?

To eat it, the snake must move so that (6,3) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is food, but also occupied? Snake positions: index 9: (6,2), and food at (6,2), so also under body.\n> \n> (3,4) is food, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,3),(2,2),...,(3,3) at (3,3), then (4,3), etc. (3,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Let's list food and their status:\n> \n> - Food (6,3): at (6,3), occupied by snake index 10 (body segment)\n> \n> - Food (3,4): at (3,4), not occupied, free cell\n> \n> - Food (6,2): at (6,2), occupied by snake index 9 (body segment)\n> \n> To eat (6,3) or (6,2), we need to vacate those cells first.\n> \n> For (3,4), it's free, so can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) or L to (1,3).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,4), then head at (2,4) turn 74.\n> \n> From (2,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction U, so cannot D?

It's turn 74. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, these are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,4), then body segments down to (2,1), then over to (3,1), up to (3,2), (3,3), then to (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake is 15 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (2,4) from below, so from (2,3), I assume.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But it's already at (6,3), and the snake has a segment at (6,3) in its body. Looking at snake positions: (6,3) is a body segment. Specifically, from the list: positions are [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]. So (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body. Therefore, this food can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then back, but with life span 1, it might not be possible.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 74 if not eaten on turn 74. Since the snake is already on it, and the head is not on it, it can't be eaten this turn. Head is at (2,4), so (6,3) is a body segment. For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. But with life span 1, after this turn, it disappears, so it can't be eaten at all. Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 74, life span is 1, after turn 74, it becomes 0 and disappears. So if not eaten on turn 74, it's gone. But since head is not on (6,3), and it's occupied, it can't be eaten this turn. So this food is effectively useless; it will disappear.\n> \n> Next food: (3,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 turns, so it has from turn 74 to 79 to be eaten.\n> \n> Another food: (6,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Value is 1 for all, so positive food.\n> \n> (6,2) is also occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (5,2) and (6,2) are both there. (5,2) and (6,2) are consecutive. (6,2) is a body segment. Similarly, food at (6,2) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): position (6,2), value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> But (6,2) is occupied by the snake, as per positions: (6,2) is the 11th segment or so. Index: head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), etc. Yes, (6,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is not occupied? Snake positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), etc. (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free, I think. Let me list all snake positions: x,y: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (3,4) is not in this list, so it should be empty. Similarly, (6,3) and (6,2) are occupied, but (3,4) is free.\n> \n> But food at (6,3) and (6,2) are on occupied cells, so they can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,4), direction Up. Since it just moved Up to (2,4) from (2,3), I assume. Head direction is U, so last move was Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is U, I cannot move Down next, because that would be reverse to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn. Allowed moves: U, L, R.

Walls: (2,6) is wall, but (2,5) should be free unless obstacle. Obstacles: list has (1,2), (1,5), etc., not (2,5). So (2,5) should be free. But y=7 is border, (2,5) is y=5, x=2, not border. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,5) is within bounds.\n> \n> - L: (1,4). But (1,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: (3,4). (3,4) is not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: internal include (1,4), but (3,4) not listed. So should be free.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,4) is there with value 1.\n> \n> Now, (3,4) has food.\n> \n> Also, possible moves to (2,5) or (3,4).\n> \n> But (2,5): is it safe? Not body, not wall.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate action.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,4), I eat the food there. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Since I eat at (3,4), which is adjacent to head, and head moves there.\n> \n> After moving to (3,4), the snake grows, so new tail is not removed, so positions: new head at (3,4), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, and so on, tail at (5,5) I think, but since it grows, the tail stays, so positions will be [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), ..., (5,5)] and the new segment is added, so tail is still (5,5), but since it grows, the last segment doesn't move, so positions: after eating, head moves to (3,4), then body includes (2,4) and all, and since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, now it stays, and new segment is added at head? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; after move, tail stays if ate food.\n> \n> Sequence: on turn, head moves to new cell, if food, it is eaten, and snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn. So positions: new head at new position, then previous positions all shift, but tail remains for that move.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to food, the snake gains one segment, so the tail stays where it was.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,4), which has food, so I eat it, new head at (3,4), body: (2,4) which was head, now second, then (2,3), (2,2), ..., up to (5,5), and since I ate, the snake grows, so tail remains at (5,5), no removal.\n> \n> Current length 15, after eating, length 16.\n> \n> Now, direction: I moved R to (3,4), so new head direction is R?

(3,4) seems safe, no body or wall.\n> \n> Option 2: Move U to (2,5). (2,5) is empty, no food, so no eat, head moves to (2,5), tail moves away, so snake shortens? No, if no eat, head moves to (2,5), body follows, tail at (5,5) is removed, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), ..., (6,4), (5,4), and (5,5) removed?

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,4) and (5,5) are not adjacent; (2,4) to (3,4) is adjacent, but (5,5) is far.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> If I eat (3,4), I grow, so the snake becomes longer, which might make it easier to collide.\n> \n> But with life spans, I need to eat (3,4) within 6 turns, but I can eat it now.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) within 9 turns.\n> \n> But since (6,2) is occupied, I need to free it first.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the body moves from (6,2), then (6,2) becomes free, and I can go eat it.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) is occupied by the 10th segment or something.\n> \n> In the snake, (6,2) is position 10 in the list, but it will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> For instance, if I move head to (2,5) or (3,4), the body will shift.\n> \n> Let's simulate both options.\n> \n> First option: move R to (3,4) on turn 74, eat food, score +1, new head (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,4), body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) and since ate, tail stays, length 16.\n> \n> (6,2) is still occupied, but after this move, the segment at (6,2) is still there, but in the new positions, (5,2) is at index 10, (6,2) at 11, etc.\n> \n> Positions: 0: (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,2), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,5)\n> \n> So (6,2) is occupied by index 11.\n> \n> Now, from head (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), then no eat, so head moves to (3,5), body shifts, tail (5,5) removed, new positions: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,2), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,3), 14: (6,4), and (5,4) removed?

It's turn 75. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, these are all blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,4), then body segments: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long. Head direction is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food: only one food item given: (6,2) with value 1 and life span 9. But it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 9, 1)\". I think this means position (6,2), life span 9, value 1. Value 1 is positive food, since +1 reward.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,4), and it's moving right, so from (3,4), possible moves: up, down, left, right. But since head direction is right, I can't instantly reverse to left. So available moves: up, down, right. Left is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4). Moving right would go to (4,4). Is (4,4) occupied or a wall? Let's see.\n> \n> Walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,4) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (4,2) is an obstacle, but (4,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). So (4,4) is not occupied, so moving right to (4,4) should be safe for now.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns. Also, there's food at (6,2) with life span 9. It will disappear after 9 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 75, life span 9, meaning it will disappear after turn 75 + 8 = 83? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0. So at turn 75, life span 9, it will be present for turns 75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82, and disappear at turn 83? No.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, that means at the start of turn t, life span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1. But when it becomes 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten only if life span >=1 when head moves onto it.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, if life span is L, it means it has L turns left including this one. So it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> Here, at turn 75, life span 9, so it will be present for turns 75 to 75+8=83? Turn 75: L=9, after turn 75, L=8; turn 76: L=8, after turn 76, L=7; ... after turn 83: L=0, so it disappears before turn 84. So it can be eaten from turn 75 to turn 83 inclusive.\n> \n> But turn 83 is the last turn it can be eaten, since at turn 84 it's gone.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (6,2). But looking at the snake, (6,2) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,2), which is the 11th segment? Let's index: head (3,4) index 0, (2,4)1, (2,3)2, (2,2)3, (2,1)4, (3,1)5, (3,2)6, (3,3)7, (4,3)8, (5,3)9, (5,2)10, (6,2)11, (6,3)12, (6,4)13, (5,4)14, (5,5)15. So (6,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food is at (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (6,2), which is currently occupied by the body. The tail is at (5,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> First, I need to see if and when the body might move away from (6,2).\n> \n> The snake moves one cell per turn, so the segment at (6,2) will move when the snake moves. Depending on the path, it might vacate (6,2) at some point.\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (3,4), and (6,2) is far away. Let me sketch the grid to understand.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, but cells are from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (4,2) is obstacle, etc.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Then: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail.\n> \n> From (5,5) to (5,4) to (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (4,3), etc. So the snake is coiled.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,2) is a body segment, and food is there. Since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten now. Only when the snake moves and that segment moves away, then if head comes later, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But the life span is 9, so it has 9 turns left including turn 75.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: up (U) to (3,5), down (D) to (3,3), right (R) to (4,4), left (L) to (2,4) but left is opposite to current direction (R), so not allowed. So only U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe.\n> \n> (3,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), etc., no (3,5). Walls: y=7 is border, but (3,5) is within bounds. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (4,6), (1,5), etc., but (3,5) not listed, so free. So U to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> (3,3): down to (3,3). (3,3) is occupied by snake body, segment 7? Positions: index 7 is (3,3), which is body. So moving to (3,3) would cause collision with body, deadly. So D is not safe.\n> \n> (4,4): right to (4,4). (4,4) not in snake positions, not in walls or obstacles, so should be safe.\n> \n> So immediately, D is invalid because of self-collision. So only U or R are possible for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, the food at (6,2) might be a target, but it's under the body now.\n> \n> First, when will the snake move away from (6,2)? The snake moves, so each turn, the head moves, and tail moves forward, so the body shifts.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (6,2) is part of the body. When the snake moves, the tail will move, but the segment at (6,2) might stay or move depending on the path.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail. Tail is at (5,5). When the snake moves, the tail will move to where the second-last segment was, which is (5,4)? Positions: tail is (5,5), before that is (6,4)? Let's see the sequence: from head to tail: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n> \n> So the segments are in order: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,2), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> So the tail is at (5,5), and the second-last is (5,4) at index 14.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. The tail segment (5,5) will be removed if no food is eaten, but since we move, the tail moves to (5,4), and the cell (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it is index 11. When the snake moves, the segment at (6,2) will move to where index 10 was, which is (5,2)? After move, each segment i moves to the position of segment i-1 from previous state.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 75, we move right to (4,4).\n> \n> Then new head position: (4,4)\n> \n> The body segments: segment 1 (was (2,4)) moves to head old position (3,4), segment 2 (was (2,3)) moves to (2,4), and so on, up to segment 15 (tail at (5,5)) moves to (5,4), and the old tail position (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,2): segment 11 was at (6,2). After move, it moves to where segment 10 was, which is (5,2). So the cell (6,2) is now occupied by segment 12 which was at (6,3), no.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, the first body segment moves to old head position, second body segment moves to old first body position, and so on.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (4,4) if we move right\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (3,4)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 (2,1)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old segment 9 (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old segment 10 (5,2)\n> \n> - New segment 12: old segment 11 (6,2)  // this is the food position\n> \n> - New segment 13: old segment 12 (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 14: old segment 13 (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 15: old segment 14 (5,4)  // new tail\n> \n> Old tail (5,5) is removed.\n> \n> Now, food is at (6,2), and in the new state, segment 12 is at (6,2), because old segment 11 was at (6,2) and new segment 12 moves there? Let's clarify:\n> \n> After the move, the cell that was (6,2) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (6,3), which is segment 12 old position.\n> \n> In terms of the cell (6,2): previously occupied by segment 11. After move, segment 11 moves to where segment 10 was, (5,2), so the cell (6,2) is now occupied by segment 12, which moves from (6,3) to (6,2) (since it takes the place of segment 11).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is now occupied by segment 13 from (6,4), and so on.\n> \n> So the food at (6,2) is still under the body, now occupied by the segment that was previously at (6,3).\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body segment on (6,2) changes, but it remains occupied until the tail moves past it or something.\n> \n> The tail is currently at (5,5), and after move, tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> The food is at (6,2), which is near the tail end.\n> \n> To vacate (6,2), the snake needs to move in such a way that the segment on (6,2) moves away and no other segment moves there immediately, but since the snake is contiguous, it only vacates when the tail leaves it.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,2) will be vacated when the tail moves from there, but currently it's not the tail.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be free when the segment that is there moves and no new segment comes, which happens when it is the tail position and we move, but (6,2) is not the tail now.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,5), so (6,2) is a body segment, index 11 or 12, not tail.\n> \n> (6,2) will be vacated when the snake moves and that position is no longer occupied, which will happen when the tail moves away from that area or the snake changes shape.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the position (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to another cell and no segment moves to (6,2), which means that (6,2) must be the tail position at some point.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is at (6,2), then when we move, the tail leaves and it is vacated.\n> \n> But currently, the tail is at (5,5), not (6,2).\n> \n> How many moves until (6,2) is the tail? The snake has 16 segments, so the tail is index 15. (6,2) is index 11 in current state, so it is 4 positions from the tail?

No.\n> \n> When we eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, head is at the food cell, and the previous tail remains, so now the segment that was tail is still there, and we add a new segment at the end? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Normally, when no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> When food eaten: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but tail does not move; instead, we add a new segment at the position where tail was, so the tail stays, and snake grows by one.\n> \n> So in this case: at turn t, tail at P with food.\n> \n> Head at Q adjacent to P.\n> \n> We move head to P.\n> \n> Since P has food, we eat: head moves to P, body segments shift, but tail stays at P because we eat, so the new head is at P, and the old tail is still at P, so they occupy the same cell, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, so if head moves to a food cell that was occupied by the tail, and head was adjacent, it causes collision because head and tail end up on same cell.\n> \n> If head was not adjacent, but moves to P, since P was tail, and head moves there, but if head was not adjacent, after move, head at P, tail at P (since it stays), same cell, collision immediately.\n> \n> I think I missed that.\n> \n> If the food is under the tail, and head moves to it to eat, since the tail is there, and after eating, tail stays, so head and tail on same cell, collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Specifically for food under body, it must be vacated first.\n> \n> In the case where food is under tail, if we move such that the tail moves away, vacating the cell, then head can move to it later.\n> \n> But when tail moves away, the food is revealed, and can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> In this scenario, at turn 79, tail is at (6,2) with food.\n> \n> If on turn 80, we move the tail away from (6,2), so (6,2) is vacated, and food is there.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to (6,2) on turn 80 or later, it can eat it.\n> \n> But on turn 80, after moving tail away, (6,2) is free, so head can move to it on turn 80 to eat.\n> \n> But at turn 79, head is somewhere, not necessarily adjacent.\n> \n> At turn 79, tail at (6,2), head at some position.\n> \n> On turn 80, we move the head to some new position, and the tail moves to the next position, vacating (6,2).\n> \n> Then, if we move head to (6,2) on turn 80, it eats the food.\n> \n> Now, at the moment of moving to (6,2), the cell is free, so no collision with body, and since we eat, the snake grows.\n> \n> The key point is that at turn 79, when tail is at (6,2), head should not be adjacent to (6,2) to avoid the tail reward danger, but the danger is when eating, not at that turn.\n> \n> The tail reward danger is a specific case when eating food on tail cell from adjacent position.\n> \n> But if we eat after it's vacated, it should be fine.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 80, after tail moves, (6,2) is vacated, food is there, head moves to it, eats, no problem, as long as head wasn't adjacent at turn 79.\n> \n> If head was adjacent at turn 79, and we move to (6,2) on turn 80, it might be ok, because at turn 79, head and tail are adjacent, but not on same cell, and on turn 80, tail moves away, head moves to (6,2), which is now free, so no collision.\n> \n> Then when we eat, head at (6,2), tail has moved to another cell, so no issue.\n> \n> The tail reward danger only applies if the food is on the tail cell and we move to it from adjacent while it's still tail.\n> \n> But once the tail moves away, it's just a free cell with food.\n> \n> So in this case, for turn 80, we can move head to (6,2) after it's vacated.\n> \n> To do that, at turn 80, head should move to (6,2).\n> \n> So at turn 79, head should be at a cell adjacent to (6,2), such as (6,3), (6,1), or (5,2).\n> \n> And at turn 79, tail is at (6,2), so we need to ensure that at turn 79, head is not at a position that would cause the danger, but since we are not eating on turn 79, it should be fine.\n> \n> The danger is only when we actually eat the food.\n> \n> So for turn 79, we can have head at (5,2), for example, which is adjacent to tail at (6,2), but we don't eat yet.\n> \n> Then on turn 80, we move to (6,2), which is now vacated (since tail moved),

head moves to (6,2), eats, good.\n> \n> And since head was adjacent at turn 79, but we didn't eat then, so no danger.\n> \n> The danger is only if we eat while moving to the tail cell from

Standard snake rules: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays in place, meaning the body extends.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when you move to a food cell, you don't remove the tail that turn, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,5), the new head is (2,5), and since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the new positions would be: head (2,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (3,4), (2,4), etc., all the way to the tail.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list in order: indices 0: (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,2), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,3), 14: (6,4), 15: (5,4)\n> \n> Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> After moving Left to (2,5) and eating food, the new head is (2,5), and since food is eaten, the tail (5,4) does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. New positions: head (2,5), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) — and tail remains (5,4), but since we added a segment, the last segment stays, so positions: [ (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ] with length 17 now? Original was 16 segments? Count: positions have 16 elements, from 0 to 15, so 16 cells.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (2,5), previous head (3,5) becomes second, and so on, up to tail (5,4), but since we ate, tail doesn't advance, so the segment that was tail stays, and we add a new head, so length increases by 1. So new positions: [ (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), ... all previous positions except the tail is not removed, so the body includes all previous cells plus the new head position. So from index 0 to 15, 16 cells, after eating, positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and (5,4) — that's 17 positions.\n> \n> (5,4) was the tail, and it stays, so yes, 17 segments.\n> \n> Now, the issue: after moving to (2,5), head is at (2,5), and direction would be Left since I moved left.\n> \n> But now, what about the food at (6,2)? It's under the body at (6,2), which is still occupied, but since we moved, the body might move away later.\n> \n> Life span is 8, so it has 8 turns left.\n> \n> But for now, moving Left to eat (2,5) seems good, immediate reward.\n> \n> But is there danger? Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (2,5), what is the tail? Tail is at (5,4). Is head adjacent to tail? (2,5) and (5,4): distance |2-5| + |5-4| = 3+1=4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (2,5) neighbors: (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6). (5,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonally or further.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> But let's think long-term.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (6,2). It's currently under the snake body at (12: (6,2)). To eat it, I need the body to move away from (6,2), then head to move there.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the body will eventually move if the snake progresses.\n> \n> For example, if I continue moving, the tail will move forward, so (6,2) might be vacated.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (6,2) is part of the body. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are vacated.\n> \n> In standard snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, unless you eat food.\n> \n> Since (6,2) has food, but it's under body, it can be eaten only when the body leaves and head enters.\n> \n> So, I need to plan a path where later, head can go to (6,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,5), it's free now.\n> \n> But if I eat (2,5) now, I get +1, but I need to see the grid.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: for example, if I move Up to (3,6), what is there? (3,6) is not wall, not snake, and no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> If I move Right to (4,5), similarly empty.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the area.\n> \n> The snake is quite long, 16 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8 = 64 cells, walls and obstacles reduce space.\n> \n> Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so 36 free cells? 8x8 minus borders, but borders are the edges, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7 inclusive, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. So inner cells are (x,y) with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, but there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> List: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> So these are also walls.\n> \n> Free cells: all (x,y) not on border walls, not internal obstacles, and not occupied by snake.\n> \n> But snake occupies some, which change.\n> \n> Total possible cells: 8x8 = 64 cells.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Number: top and bottom rows: y=0 and y=7, each has 8 cells, but corners shared, so 2*8 - 4? Better: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Number: for x=0: 8 cells, x=7:8 cells, y=0: but (0,0) and (7,0) already counted, so add 6 cells for y=0 (x=1 to6), similarly y=7: 6 cells (x=1 to6), so total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Cells with x=0: y from 0 to 7, 8 cells\n> \n> - Cells with x=7: y from 0 to 7, 8 cells\n> \n> - Cells with y=0 and x not 0 or 7: x from 1 to 6, 6 cells\n> \n> - Cells with y=7 and x not 0 or 7: x from 1 to 6, 6 cells\n> \n> Total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: 8 cells as listed.\n> \n> So total wall cells: 28 + 8 = 36.\n> \n> Total cells: 64, so free cells: 64 - 36 = 28, but snake occupies 16, so only 12 free cells left? 28 free cells minus 16 snake, so 12 empty cells, but some have food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (2,5), but (6,2) is currently occupied by snake, so not free, (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Free cells are those not wall and not occupied.\n> \n> At this moment, free cells: total non-wall cells: 64 - 36 = 28.\n> \n> Snake occupies 16, so 12 free cells.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) is one of them, and (6,2) is occupied, so not free.\n> \n> Other free cells have no food.\n> \n> So space is tight; I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 76 actions.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (2,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> Then head at (2,5), direction Left.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since direction Left, I can move L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n> \n> L to (1,5): but (1,5) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (1,5), yes, from list: (1,5) is an obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> U to (2,6): (2,6) is an obstacle? Obstacles: (2,6) is listed, yes, internal obstacle.\n> \n> D to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by snake body? Current positions, after move, if I move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), etc. So (2,4) is the third segment, so it's body, cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> After moving to (2,5), the cells occupied are: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: (1,5) - obstacle, wall\n> \n> - Up: (2,6) - obstacle, wall\n> \n> - Down: (2,4) - occupied by snake body (segment at index 3)\n> \n> - Right: (3,5) - but (3,5) is now the second segment, occupied, and also, moving right would be reverse? Current direction after moving left is Left, so moving Right would be opposite, instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Directions: after moving Left to (2,5), the head direction is now Left. So from (2,5), moving Right to (3,5) is opposite to current direction, so not allowed.\n> \n> Moving Up to (2,6) is wall.\n> \n> Moving Down to (2,4) is snake body.\n> \n> Moving Left to (1,5) is wall.\n> \n> So no possible moves! If I move to (2,5), I immediately have no valid moves next turn, and I die.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Let's confirm: from (2,5), neighbors:\n> \n> - West: (1,5) - obstacle, wall\n> \n> - North: (2,6) - obstacle, wall\n> \n> - South: (2,4) - occupied by snake body (after the move, (2,4) is still part of the body)\n> \n> - East: (3,5) - occupied by the second segment of the snake, and also moving east is opposite to current left direction, so doubly invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Left to (2,5) is suicide; I get stuck and die next turn.\n> \n> So I must not do that.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Left is not an option; it's deadly.\n> \n> Now, what about moving Up to (3,6)?\n> \n> (3,6): is it free?

Since no food eaten, tail moves, so the last segment (5,4) is removed, and new positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] — (5,4) was tail, removed, and (6,4) is now the last?

It's turn 77, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are defined by borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those cells, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x are walls. Also, internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. So I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). That's 16 segments. Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,2), it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn, so it will vanish if not eaten by turn 77 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L. For example, at turn 77, life span 7 means it will be gone after 7 turns, so it exists for turns 77, 78, ..., 83, and disappears at turn 84? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 77, countdown is 7, then turn 78, countdown 6, ..., turn 83, countdown 1, turn 84, countdown 0 and disappears. But it can be eaten only when countdown >0, I assume.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life_span = L, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = L\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1: countdown = 1\n> \n> - Turn t + L: countdown = 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So food can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (6,2) at turn 77, life_span=7, so it exists until turn 83 (countdown 1), disappears at turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) life_span=9, exists until turn 85 (77+9-1=85), disappears at turn 86.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), direction R (right). So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So I cannot move L on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): U (up, to (4,6)? y+1 is up, I think. Coordinate system: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> So from (4,5):\n> \n> - U: (4,6)\n> \n> - D: (4,4)\n> \n> - R: (5,5)\n> \n> - L: (3,5) but (3,5) is the second segment, and since no instant reverse, I cannot go L to (3,5) because that's opposite to current R.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite, so L is invalid.\n> \n> Now, check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, border walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. So (4,6): y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is not wall, it's within 1 to 6, I think. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is free, similarly y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 is playable.\n> \n> Now internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]\n> \n> So (4,6) is an obstacle, so U to (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> D to (4,4): is (4,4) free? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells to avoid collision.\n> \n> Snake: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n> \n> So (4,4) is not in snake positions, so it should be free? Let me check: positions are (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), ... (4,3), etc. No (4,4), so (4,4) is empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: (4,4) is not in walls or obstacles. Obstacles are at (4,6), (1,2), etc., not (4,4).\n> \n> So D to (4,4) is possible.\n> \n> R to (5,5): is (5,5) free? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), no (5,5). Walls? Not in obstacles.

Also, instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> U to (4,6) is obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> Food available: (6,2) and (2,5).\n> \n> (6,2) is at position (6,2), which is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (6,2), which is the 14th segment? Let's see: positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So (6,2) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the segment before tail? Tail is (6,4), but (6,2) is part of body.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is on a snake body cell. But the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So (6,2) has food, but it's under snake body now. To eat it, the snake must move so that (6,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is food, is it occupied? (2,5) not in snake positions, so it's free to eat if head goes there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4), (2,3), etc., no (2,5), so (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,2) life 7, so must be eaten by turn 83.\n> \n> (2,5) life 9, by turn 85.\n> \n> Current turn 77.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), direction R.\n> \n> I need to choose between D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n> \n> If I go R to (5,5), then head to (5,5), which is empty. Then snake moves, tail moves, so the segment at (6,4) will move when snake advances.\n> \n> After moving, the snake body: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed from the end, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment to previous position, tail cell vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head to food cell, new tail added, so length increases, and tail position stays or something.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position remains occupied.\n> \n> Otherwise, when no food, tail moves forward, vacating the old tail cell.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: like (6,2), it can be eaten only after the body moves away.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail will move, but since (6,2) is not the tail, it might not be vacated immediately.\n> \n> Let's see the snake order: positions indexed from head to tail.\n> \n> Index 0: (4,5) head\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (2,4)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (2,2)\n> \n> 6: (2,1)\n> \n> 7: (3,1)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (3,3)\n> \n> 10: (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (5,3)\n> \n> 12: (5,2)\n> \n> 13: (6,2)  // this is the segment at (6,2)\n> \n> 14: (6,3)\n> \n> 15: (6,4) tail\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, say to (5,5) if I go R.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (5,5), then body: the old head position (4,5) becomes segment 1, old segment 1 (3,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to old segment 14 (6,3) becomes segment 15, and old segment 15 (6,4) is vacated, so tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, segment 13 was at (6,2), after move, since head moved and no growth, segment 13 moves to where segment 12 was? Let's think.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,5)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head position (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: old segment 1 position (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 13: old segment 12 position (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 14: old segment 13 position (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 15: old segment 14 position (6,3)\n> \n> And old segment 15 (6,4) vacated.\n> \n> So (6,2) is now occupied by segment 14, which was previously at (6,3). So (6,2) is still occupied, by a different segment. The food is still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> To vacate (6,2), the snake needs to move so that no segment is on it. That happens only if the segment that was on (6,2) moves away and no new segment comes, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the segment at (6,2) moves to another cell, and if that cell is not immediately reoccupied, it becomes free.\n> \n> In this case, segment 13 is at (6,2). When the snake moves, segment 13 moves to the position of segment 12, which is (5,2). Then (6,2) is vacated, but only if no new segment comes to it immediately.\n> \n> After move, the cell (6,2) is free because segment 13 moved to (5,2), and segment 14 moves to (6,3), not to (6,2).\n> \n> After move to (5,5):\n> \n> - New segment 0: (5,5) head\n> \n> - Seg 1: (4,5)\n> \n> - Seg 2: (3,5)\n> \n> - Seg 3: (3,4)\n> \n> - Seg 4: (2,4)\n> \n> - Seg 5: (2,3)\n> \n> - Seg 6: (2,2)\n> \n> - Seg 7: (2,1)\n> \n> - Seg 8: (3,1)\n> \n> - Seg 9: (3,2)\n> \n> - Seg 10: (3,3)\n> \n> - Seg 11: (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg 12: (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg 13: (5,2)  // old seg 12 position\n> \n> - Seg 14: (6,2)  // old seg 13 position? Old seg 13 was at (6,2), but now it moves to where old seg 12 was, which is (5,2)\n> \n> Old seg 12 was at (5,2), so new seg 13 is at (5,2)\n> \n> New seg 14 is at old seg 13 position, which is (6,2)\n> \n> Old seg 13 was at (6,2), so new seg 14 is at (6,2)\n> \n> Then new seg 15 at old seg 14 position (6,3)\n> \n> Old seg 15 at (6,4) vacated.\n> \n> So (6,2) is still occupied by new segment 14. So the food is still covered.\n> \n> To free (6,2), the segment on it must move away. Since the snake is moving, eventually when that segment moves, it will be free, but it might take time.\n> \n> The segment at (6,2) is seg 13. When the snake moves, seg 13 moves to the next position in line, which is the position of seg 12, (5,2). But seg 12 is at (5,2), so when seg 13 moves to (5,2), (6,2) is left, but at the same time, seg 14 moves to (6,3), not to (6,2), so (6,2) is vacated.\n> \n> In the move, when head moves, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment. So for cell (6,2), it was occupied by seg 13. After move, seg 13 is now at the position that was previously seg 12's position, which is (5,2). So seg 13 leaves (6,2) and goes to (5,2). Then, no other segment moves to (6,2) because seg 14 moves to where seg 13 was, but seg 13 was at (6,2), so seg 14 moves to (6,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions before move:\n> \n> Seg 12: (5,2)\n> \n> Seg 13: (6,2)\n> \n> Seg 14: (6,3)\n> \n> Seg 15: (6,4)\n> \n> After move, no food eaten:\n> \n> New seg 12: position of old seg 12? No, the segments are renumbered.\n> \n> New head at new position.\n> \n> New segment 1: old head position\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 position\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment k: old segment (k-1) position for k from 1 to 15, but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so only 15 segments? Snake has 16 segments, so after move with no growth, it has 15 segments.\n> \n> Original snake: 16 segments.\n> \n> After move, if no food, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so 15 segments.\n> \n> New head at (5,5)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head at (4,5)\n> \n> New segment 2: old seg 1 at (3,5)\n> \n> New segment 3: old seg 2 at (3,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 12: old seg 11 at (5,3)  // old seg 11 is (5,3)\n> \n> Old seg 11: (5,3)\n> \n> Old seg 12: (5,2)\n> \n> Old seg 13: (6,2)\n> \n> Old seg 14: (6,3)\n> \n> Old seg 15: (6,4) tail\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> New seg 0: (5,5)\n> \n> New seg 1: (4,5)\n> \n> New seg 2: (3,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New seg 11: old seg 10 at (4,3)?

That means the segment that is on (6,2) must be the last segment or something, but it's not.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the position (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that was on it moves to a different cell and no segment comes to it in the same move.\n> \n> In each move, a body segment leaves its cell and moves to the previous segment's cell, so the cell it left is vacated, unless it is the cell that the next segment moves into, but since segments move to different cells, the vacated cell is free for that turn.\n> \n> When a segment moves from cell A to cell B, cell A is vacated, and if no other segment moves to cell A in the same move, it is free.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (6,2), it is occupied by seg 13. When the snake moves, seg 13 moves to the position of seg 12, which is (5,2). So seg 13 leaves (6,2) and goes to (5,2), so (6,2) is vacated. At the same time, seg 14 moves to the position of seg 13, which was (6,2), so seg 14 moves to (6,2). So (6,2) is vacated by seg 13 but immediately occupied by seg 14. So it is never free; it changes which segment is on it, but the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, for food under body, it can only be eaten when the segment on it moves away and no segment moves to it, which only happens if it is the tail cell and the snake moves without growing, then the tail moves and the cell is vacated.\n> \n> In general, a cell is vacated when it is the tail position and no food is eaten, so the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it's not the tail, when the segment on it moves, the next segment moves in, so it stays occupied.\n> \n> So for (6,2), it is currently not the tail. The tail is at (6,4). To vacate (6,2), it needs to become the tail or something.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4). When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves to (6,3), vacating (6,4). But (6,2) is not affected.\n> \n> (6,2) will only be vacated when the segment on it is the one that moves and it is not replaced, but since it's not the tail, it is always replaced by the next segment.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,2) is occupied by seg 13. When seg 13 moves to seg 12's position, seg 14 moves to seg 13's old position, so (6,2) is taken by seg 14.\n> \n> Only when a cell is the tail and the snake moves without eating, it is vacated.\n> \n> For (6,2) to be free, it must be the tail position at some point.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,4). The snake needs to move so that (6,2) becomes the tail.\n> \n> But the tail is moving, so it might take time.\n> \n> From the positions, the tail is at (6,4), and the segments are connected, so to make (6,2) the tail, the snake needs to move in a way that the tail shortens or something, but without eating, the tail moves, but the cell (6,2) is not becoming tail soon.\n> \n> Perhaps I should map the snake's path.\n> \n> The snake is long, 16 segments. Positions from head to tail: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So the body forms a path. From (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4), so (6,2) is not the tail; it's connected to (6,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it goes straight, the tail will move from (6,4) to (6,3), then to (6,2), etc.\n> \n> But to vacate (6,2), it needs to be the tail cell when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> Currently, if the snake keeps moving without eating, after a few moves, the tail will be at (6,2).\n> \n> For example, after one move with no eat, tail moves to (6,3).\n> \n> After two moves, tail at (6,2).\n> \n> After three moves, tail at (5,2), etc.\n> \n> But since the food is on (6,2), and it's under body, it can be eaten only when the head moves to it after it is vacated.\n> \n> So for (6,2), it will be vacated when it becomes the tail and the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 77, (6,2) is occupied by seg 13.\n> \n> After one move with no eat, the tail moves to (6,3), and (6,2) is now occupied by the new tail segment or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 77, positions as given.\n> \n> After move to (5,5) for example, no eat:\n> \n> New head: (5,5)\n> \n> New seg1: (4,5)\n> \n> ...\n> New seg13: (5,2)  // old seg12 position\n> \n> New seg14: (6,2)  // old seg13 position\n> \n> New seg15: (6,3)  // old seg14 position, and tail at (6,3)\n> \n> Old tail (6,4) vacated.\n> \n> So (6,2) still occupied by new seg14.\n> \n> After another move, say head to (5,6) or something, but (5,6) is obstacle?

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and also internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). The head direction is R (right), so it was moving right to (5,5).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life_span=6, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life_span=8, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,2) is under the snake's body? Snake positions include (6,2) and (6,3). Let's list all snake positions to see:\n> \n> From the list: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]\n> \n> So (6,2) is the second last segment, and (6,3) is the last. Food is at (6,2) with life_span 6. Since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. But (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake, so the food might have spawned there, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,5) is not occupied by snake; let's check: snake positions are all listed, (2,5) is not there. So (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, current turn is 78. Food at (6,2) has life_span 6, so it will disappear after turn 78 + 6 = turn 84? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 78, it has 6 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 83? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life_span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, L=6, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+5, and disappear at turn t+6. But since countdown decreases each turn, at turn t, countdown=L, at turn t+1, countdown=L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, countdown=1, then at turn t+L, it disappears. So the food is available from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5): life_span 8 at turn 78, so available from turn 78 to 78+7=85? Turns: 78 to 85? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Food at (6,2): life_span=6 at turn 78, so countdown: 6 at turn 78, 5 at 79, 4 at 80, 3 at 81, 2 at 82, 1 at 83, gone at 84. So available until turn 83.\n> \n> - Food at (2,5): life_span=8 at turn 78, countdown: 8 at 78, 7 at 79, ..., down to 1 at 85, gone at 86.

In the food list, it's given as (6,2,6,1), and in snake positions, (6,2) is part of the body, so the food must have spawned under it, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, for movement, let's check possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (5,6). Is this safe? (5,6): y=6, not wall, but internal obstacles: (4,6), (5,6)? (5,6) is listed? Internal obstacles include (5,6)? From the list: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). Yes, (5,6) is an obstacle, so cannot move there. Wall or obstacle, same thing.\n> \n> So (5,6) is occupied by obstacle, cannot move up.\n> \n> - Down: to (5,4). What is (5,4)? Not a wall, and not in obstacles list? Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (5,4) not listed, so free? But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: from list, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), etc., no (5,4), so should be free. But need to check if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Moving to (5,4): since it's not occupied by body now, and after move, the tail will move, so as long as not hitting a body segment that stays, it should be ok. But when moving, the head moves to new position, then the tail moves, so if the new head position is not occupied by any body part except possibly the tail, it's safe because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is not in snake positions, so moving down to (5,4) should be safe.\n> \n> - Left: to (4,5). But current direction is R, and moving left is opposite, so cannot do that because of no instant reverse. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> - Right: to (6,5). (6,5): x=6, y=5. Borders: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, y=5 not border. Internal obstacles: (5,6) etc., not (6,5). Snake positions: (5,5) is head, (4,5) is next, etc. (6,5) not in list, so should be free.\n> \n> But is (6,5) within bounds? x=6, y=5, since borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok, not wall. Walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells where x=0 or x=7, similarly for y. So x=6 is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: D (down to (5,4)) or R (right to (6,5)). Up is blocked by obstacle, left is illegal due to reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food and long-term survival.\n> \n> First, food at (6,2) is under the snake body at position (6,2). To eat it, the snake must move away from (6,2), and then head must move to (6,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) is occupied by the snake, so we need to move the tail away first.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,5) is free, at (2,5).\n> \n> Now, (2,5): let's see where it is relative to head. Head at (5,5), so (2,5) is left and up? x=2, y=5, head at x=5,y=5, so it's left by 3, same y.\n> \n> Distance: |dx|=3, |dy|=0.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, head at (5,5), so |dx|=1, |dy|=3.\n> \n> But (6,2) is occupied now.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail: snake positions last is (6,3), and second last is (6,2). Tail segment is (6,3), and before that (6,2).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so the current tail is (6,3), and after move, it will be cut off if no food eaten, or new segment added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for the food at (6,2), it's under (6,2), which is the second last segment.\n> \n> To eat (6,2) food, we need the head to move to (6,2) after the snake has moved away from it.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (6,2) is part of the body.

The new head is at the food, the old head becomes the first body segment, and so on, and the tail remains in place for that move, so the position that was the tail is still occupied by the tail, and the new segment is added there, but since the tail doesn't move, it's the same.\n> \n> For collision detection, when moving to a cell, it must not be occupied by any body segment except the tail if it will move.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), when we move to it, it is not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> After eating, the tail position is the same as before, but now it is part of the body, and there is a new tail at the same cell for that instant, but on the next move, it moves.\n> \n> For simplicity, in this problem, we can assume that after eating, the new tail is at the old tail position.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, it's fine.\n> \n> For from (6,2), we can move to (5,2) or (6,1).\n> \n> (5,2) in the positions after eating: index 1 is (6,3), index 2 is (6,4), etc., what about (5,2)?

(6,5) and (6,2), difference in y is 3, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right, so (6,5) and (6,4) would be adjacent, but (6,5) and (6,2) are not, since |dy|=3.\n> \n> So currently, head and tail are not adjacent.\n> \n> After I move, say to (6,6), then head at (6,6), tail at (5,2) as we said earlier.\n> \n> Then (6,2) is free with food.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,2), I need to move head to (6,2). But from (6,6), I can go down to (6,5), but (6,5) is now part of the body, since after move, (6,5) is the second segment.\n> \n> After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), segment 1: (6,5), segment 2: (5,5), ..., segment 15: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> So (6,5) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (6,4) is free, I think.\n> \n> From (6,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current head direction after move to (6,6) would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> After moving U, head direction is U.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), direction U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D (down) because instant reverse.\n> \n> U: to (6,7), but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: to (5,6), but (5,6) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R: to (7,6), x=7 border wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by the body, and also D is opposite to current direction U? Current direction after move is U, so moving D would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,6), the only possible move was U, but U to (6,7) is wall, so if I move U to (6,6), I am stuck! No possible moves next turn.\n> \n> (6,6) to U: (6,7) wall, L: (5,6) obstacle wall, R: (7,6) wall, D: (6,5) body and instant reverse not allowed. So indeed, if I move U to (6,6) on turn 79, on turn 80 I have no valid move, snake dies.\n> \n> Therefore, moving U is suicidal.

(6,3) is adjacent, but to move to (6,3) from (5,4), it's right, but current direction after move to (5,4) is L (left), so moving R would be instant reverse, not allowed. So I cannot move right to (6,3).\n> \n> Only U, D, L.\n> \n> U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3), which is free? Before move, at turn 80 start, positions are after turn 79: (6,4) head, (6,5), (5,5), etc., (5,3) is segment 14, occupied, so (5,3) is not free, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,4) free.\n> \n> D to (5,3) not free.\n> \n> So only possible move from (5,4) is L to (4,4) or U to (5,5) but occupied, so only L to (4,4).\n> \n> Then I go left, away from (6,2), and I might not reach it in time.\n> \n> For example, from (4,4), I can go down to (4,3) but occupied, or left to (3,4), etc., it would take multiple turns to get back to (6,2), and by turn 82 it might be gone or I can't reach.\n> \n> Specifically, from (6,4) to (6,2) is 2 steps down if I go directly, but via (5,4) it's longer.\n> \n> So it's better to go directly to (6,3) on turn 80 then to (6,2) on turn 81.\n> \n> Moreover, after eating, I get +1 score and grow.\n> \n> Now, on turn 81, after eating (6,2), positions: head at (6,2), tail at (5,3) (since didn't move), and new segment added, so snake length 17 now.\n> \n> Then I need to move from there.\n> \n> But first, let's outline the sequence.\n> \n> Turn 79: move D to (6,4)\n> \n> Turn 80: move D to (6,3)\n> \n> Turn 81: move D to (6,2) to eat food.\n> \n> Now, after that, on turn 81, head at (6,2), direction D.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U: to (6,3), but (6,3) is now occupied?

No.\n> \n> When snake grows, the head moves to the new position, and the tail stays, so the body segments shift, but tail remains.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (6,2), then the first body segment is the old head position (6,3), then next is old seg1 (6,4), then old seg2 (6,5), old seg3 (5,5), ..., old seg14 (4,3), old seg15 (5,3), and since tail didn't move, (5,3) is still there, but now it's the second last segment, and a new segment is added at the tail, but the tail position is fixed? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, head moves to food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail does not move, so the last segment remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, so effectively, the segment that was tail is still tail, and the snake is longer.\n> \n> After growth: positions: index 0: new head (6,2), index 1: old head (6,3), index 2: old seg1 (6,4), index 3: old seg2 (6,5), index 4: old seg3 (5,5), index 5: old seg4 (4,5), index 6: old seg5 (3,5), index 7: old seg6 (3,4), index 8: old seg7 (2,4), index 9: old seg8 (2,3), index 10: old seg9 (2,2), index 11: old seg10 (2,1), index 12: old seg11 (3,1), index 13: old seg12 (3,2), index 14: old seg13 (3,3), index 15: old seg14 (4,3), index 16: old seg15 (5,3) and this is the tail now?

It's turn 80, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)]. These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,4), and the body segments follow. The head direction is D (down), which means the snake is moving downward. Since it's moving down, the previous position before (6,4) would be above it, but looking at the positions, (6,4) is head, then (6,5) is next, which is directly above since y increases upward or downward? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upward, but let's see the snake positions. Head at (6,4), then (6,5). If U is (x,y+1), that would mean increasing y is upward. But head at (6,4) moving D to... direction is D, so from where? The positions are listed head first: [(6,4), (6,5), ...]. So from (6,5) to (6,4)? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Next: (6,5) — that's directly above if y increases upward, but moving down to (6,4) from previous? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are given with head first, so the snake was at (6,5) before moving to (6,4). Direction is D, so moving down to (6,4). Yes, that makes sense. So from turn 79, head was at (6,5), moved down to (6,4) on turn 80, so now head is at (6,4) facing down.\n> \n> Direction is the current head direction, which is D, so it just moved down to (6,4).\n> \n> Now, the body: after (6,4) is (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Length of snake: counting positions, there are 16 segments.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so all good to eat, but I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,2), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn 80? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t, it has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t+N-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at turn t, life span is N, meaning after N turns, it's gone. So it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1? For example, if N=4 at turn 80, it will disappear after turn 83, so it can be eaten on turns 80,81,82,83? Turn 80: life span 4, after turn 80, life span becomes 3 for turn 81, and so on, until life span 1 on turn 83, then after turn 83, it disappears, so not available on turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,5): life span 6 at turn 80, so disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> (2,1): life span 9, disappears after turn 88.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 80.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,4), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but with constraints.\n> \n> First, no instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot go U immediately, because U is opposite to D.

Body: snake positions: (6,4) is head, but when I move, the head moves to new position, and body follows, so collision: I need to see if (6,3) is occupied by body after the move.\n> \n> After move, head goes to new cell, tail moves away, so the only body cell that might cause collision is if the head moves into a cell that will be occupied by the body except the tail, but since tail moves, it's safe to move to tail position only if it's the last segment.\n> \n> General rule: moving into a cell that is part of the body will cause collision, except if it's the tail, because tail moves away.

(2,1) is part of the body, it's the 10th segment or something.

So (2,5) is not occupied, and no wall or obstacle? Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). (2,5) not there, so (2,5) is free and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): snake positions, (5,2) is tail, (5,3), etc., not (6,2).

Typically in such coordinates, but let's confirm from snake positions.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), then (6,4), which is same x, y increased, so if y increases, that's up. But head direction is D, down, meaning y decreasing.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3)\n> \n> Previous position: not given, but direction is D, so it was moving down to (6,3). From where? Before (6,3) it must have come from above, but since head is first, and direction is current movement direction.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), ...] so (6,3) is head, next is (6,4), which is same x, higher y, so if y increases up, (6,4) is above (6,3). But if head is at (6,3) and moving down, to (x,y-1), which would be (6,2), but (6,2) is not in the positions yet; positions show after head is (6,4), which is above.\n> \n> Inconsistency. Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail, so head at (6,3), then the next segment is at (6,4), meaning the head is moving towards the body? No, in snake, the body follows the head.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> But here, the positions are given for current state.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), and direction is D, meaning it is facing down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Direction: \"Snake Head Direction\": D, so current movement direction is down.\n> \n> But the position after head is (6,4), which is directly above (6,3) if y increases up.\n> \n> So from (6,4) to (6,3) is down? Let's think coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (x,y) with x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — y increases up\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — y decreases down\n> \n> L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y)\n> \n> Head at (6,3), direction D, so it moved down to (6,3), meaning from (6,4) to (6,3)? But in positions, (6,4) is the second segment, so the head was at (6,4) before moving down to (6,3)? But the positions list has (6,3) first, then (6,4), which is confusing.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> The snake positions are listed from head to tail. So at turn 81, the head is at (6,3). The segment immediately behind the head is at (6,4). So if the head is at (6,3) and body at (6,4), that means the head moved down from (6,4) to (6,3), but (6,4) is still the body position.\n> \n> When the head moves, it leaves the previous position, and the body follows.\n> \n> At this moment, head is at (6,3), and it was at (6,4) before, so it moved down to (6,3) from (6,4), and the body segments are trailing.\n> \n> The direction is the current moving direction, which is down, since it moved from (6,4) to (6,3), so y decreased.\n> \n> Similarly, the next segment is (6,5), which is at (6,5), so the body goes (6,3) <- head, (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n> \n> From positions: (6,3) head, then (6,4), then (6,5), so (6,4) is between (6,3) and (6,5), so if head is at (6,3), body at (6,4), that means the snake is moving towards higher y, but direction is D, which is down, contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U is up, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), body at (6,4). Since body is at (6,4), which has higher y, so if y=4 > y=3, it is north, so the head is south of the body, meaning the head moved south to (6,3) from (6,4), so direction down is correct.\n> \n> Then next body at (6,5), y=5 > y=4, so further north.\n> \n> Then (5,5), which is west, so turning point.\n> \n> But for movement, head at (6,3), direction down, so it can move to (6,2), (5,3), or (7,3), but x=7 is wall, so (7,3) invalid. Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are borders, so (7,3) is out of bound, invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 is bottom, so (6,2) is valid? y=2, since y from 1 to 6 are playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), y=3, so (6,2) is y=2, which is valid.\n> \n> (5,3) x=5,y=3 valid.\n> \n> (6,4) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse, so since direction is down, cannot move up to (6,4), which is body anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,3): down to (6,2), left to (5,3), or right to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis, the immediate action at Turn 82 should prioritize survival over the short-lived food at (6,2), as attempting to eat it leads to inevitable death. Instead, moving left to (4,3) avoids immediate risks and keeps options open for future moves. \n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 82:\n\\boxed{L}  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n- Moving left to (4,3) (current tail) is safe because the tail will move away, avoiding collision.  \n- Avoids the dangerous bottom-right area where the snake would get trapped after eating (6,2) and (5,1).  \n- Preserves flexibility to navigate around obstacles and potentially access other food later (e.g., (2,1) when freed from the body).  \n\n**Trade-off**:  \n- Sacrifices the +1 reward from (6,2), but ensures the snake survives longer in a tightly constrained environment.  \n- The alternative (moving down) leads to a dead end within 4 turns, as shown in the simulation.  \n\n**Note**: The snake's length (16) and dense obstacles make survival the primary concern; scoring opportunities must be weighed against lethal risks.",

It's turn 82. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). I should list all obstacles to avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake is 16 segments long. Head direction is L (left), meaning it was moving left to (5,3) from (6,3)? Positions are head first: (5,3) is head, then (6,3) is the first body part. Since head direction is L, it came from right to left, so previous head was at (6,3) before moving to (5,3) on this turn? Head direction is given as current direction, I think. It says \"Snake Head Direction: L\", which should be the direction it is facing now, so it's at (5,3) facing left.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 82, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 83? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will be gone after T + L - 1? Example: if life span is 1 at turn T, it disappears after turn T, meaning it can be eaten on turn T but not after. If life span is 2 at turn T, it can be eaten on T and T+1, disappears after T+1.\n> \n> In the food list, it's given as (x, y, life_span, value). For (6,2,2,1) at turn 82, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 82 and 83, disappears after turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5,4,1): life span 4, so can be eaten until turn 85 (since turn 82 + 4 - 1 = 85? Turns: at turn 82, life span 4, so countdown: 4 at turn 82, then 3 at turn 83, 2 at turn 84, 1 at turn 85, gone after turn 85? \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it's available for N turns including current.\n> \n> Let's read: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if N is life span at turn T, after N turns it disappears. For example, if N=1, it disappears after 1 turn, meaning at the end of turn T, it's gone, so it can only be eaten on turn T.\n> \n> If N=2, it disappears after 2 turns, so at end of turn T+1, it's gone, so can be eaten on T and T+1.\n> \n> Generally, food with life span L at turn T is available from turn T to turn T + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (6,2,2,1) at turn 82: life span 2, so available on turn 82 and 83.\n> \n> (2,5,4,1): life span 4, available turn 82 to 85.\n> \n> (2,1,7,1): life span 7, available turn 82 to 88.\n> \n> (5,1,10,1): life span 10, available turn 82 to 91.\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,3), facing left. So possible moves: since it can't reverse instantly, it was moving left, so it cannot go right (opposite). So allowed moves: U, D, L (since L is not opposite, it's same direction), or if possible, but L is left, which is current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R, which is forbidden. So can go U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, the grid: let me sketch this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7).

So it can be eaten on turn 83 or 84.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,5): life span 3 at turn 83, so countdown=3, can be eaten on turns 83, 84, 85; disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> (2,1): life span 6, value 1, so available turns 83 to 88.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 9, value 1, available turns 83 to 91.\n> \n> All food have value 1, positive, since value is 1 for all. The value is given as the third number? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (x,y, value, life_span)\" or is it (x,y), value, life_span?\n> \n> In the input: \"(6, 2, 1, 1)\" – I think this means (x,y) = (6,2), value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, \"(2, 5, 3, 1)\" – (x,y)=(2,5), value=3? No, it says \"value and life span\", but in the list, it's (x1,y1, value1, life_span1), etc.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then \"- (6, 2, 1, 1)\" – this might be ambiguous.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state input, it's written as \"(6, 2, 1, 1)\" which could be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? I need to check.\n> \n> In the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then \"- (6, 2, 1, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\", but the order might be x,y, then what?\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n> \n> Look at the text: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 1, 1) - (2, 5, 3, 1) - (2, 1, 6, 1) - (5, 1, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> It says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the list, for (6,2,1,1), the third number is 1, fourth is 1, so it's unclear.\n> \n> But in the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be value first, then life_span.\n> \n> But here, it's written as \"Life Span and Value\", but the list has four numbers. Perhaps it's a typo or misordering.\n> \n> For (6,2,1,1): if value first, then value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5,3,1): if value first, value=3? But all are positive food, I think, but value could be different.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says positive food and negative food, but here all values are positive, I think.\n> \n> Let's see the values: for (6,2,1,1), if it's (x,y,value,life_span), then value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> For (2,5,3,1), if (x,y,value,life_span), then value=3, life_span=1? But life_span=1, but it says \"3,1\", so value=3, life_span=1? That seems odd, but possible.\n> \n> The text says \"Value and Life Span\", so it should be value then life_span.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1,6,1): value=6, life_span=1? Life_span=1 for all except the last?\n> \n> (2,1,6,1): if value first, value=6, life_span=1.\n> \n> (5,1,9,1): value=9, life_span=1.\n> \n> But life_span=1 for all? That can't be right because for (2,5,3,1), if life_span=1, it should disappear after this turn, but for (2,1,6,1), if life_span=1, also disappear.\n> \n> But the numbers are different: for (6,2,1,1) - value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,5,3,1) - value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,1,6,1) - value=6, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,1,9,1) - value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> All have life_span=1? But that means all food disappear after this turn if not eaten. That's possible, but let's confirm the input.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then the list. But in the core rules, it's \"Value and Life Span\", so there might be inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps \"Life Span and Value\" means it's listed as life span then value.\n> \n> For (6,2,1,1): x=6,y=2, life_span=1, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5,3,1): x=2,y=5, life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> (2,1,6,1): x=2,y=1, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (5,1,9,1): x=5,y=1, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> That makes more sense because all values are 1, and life spans are different.\n> \n> Yes, that aligns with the core rules description where value is +1 for positive food, so all these are positive food with value 1, and different life spans.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (6,2): life span 1, value 1. Disappears after turn 83.\n> \n> - Food at (2,5): life span 3, value 1. Disappears after turn 85 (available turns 83,84,85)\n> \n> - Food at (2,1): life span 6, value 1. Disappears after turn 88 (available 83 to 88)\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life span 9, value 1. Disappears after turn 91 (available 83 to 91)\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), direction L, so moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3): since direction is L, we can move U, D, L, but not R (instant reverse).\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R (right), but can move U (up), D (down), L (left).\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid. Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), I think? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8 cells.\n> \n> But walls are at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> (2,1) is part of the snake body, but there is food at (2,1) with life span 6.

Snake positions: (2,1) is occupied, (3,1), (5,1) is not in snake positions, so it might be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So (5,1) is not in this list, and not a wall, so it should be free with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is not in snake positions? (3,5), (4,5), etc., but (2,5) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> (6,2) is not listed, free.\n> \n> (2,1) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, for (2,1) food, it can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and head moves to (2,1) at that turn.\n> \n> But the snake is long, 16 segments, so tail is at (3,3) currently? Positions: head (4,3), then ... (2,1) is the 13th segment?

From (4,3) to (6,2): need to go right and down, but we can't move right because current direction is L, and R is reverse, not allowed. So cannot move directly to (6,2) from here in one move; it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (4,3): up (4,4), down (4,2), left (3,3).\n> \n> (6,2) is not adjacent; it's at (6,2), which is not reachable in one move.\n> \n> So we cannot eat (6,2) this turn; it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, (6,2) food is lost; we can't get it.\n> \n> Next, other food.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n> \n> (4,2) is an obstacle?

Obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), etc., (4,4) not listed, so free? But snake body: snake positions include (4,5), (5,5), etc., but (4,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So (4,4) is not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - Down to (4,2): but (4,2) is an internal obstacle, as listed, so blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left to (3,3): (3,3) is the tail? Positions: (3,3) is the last segment, tail. Since the tail will move when we move, moving to (3,3) is safe because the tail will vacate it.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,3) is tail, so moving to (3,3) is fine; snake grows only if eat food, but here no food at (3,3), so moving to tail position is safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> (3,3) is free to move to? Currently occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it will be free after move.\n> \n> In terms of collision: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body, it collides, except if it is the tail and no food is eaten, because tail moves.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail position is safe, as long as we don't eat food there or something.\n> \n> Specifically, if we move to tail and eat food, it might be dangerous if tail reward danger.\n> \n> But for now, no food at (3,3).\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,4): free cell\n> \n> - D to (4,2): obstacle, blocked, cannot\n> \n> - L to (3,3): tail position, safe to move\n> \n> R is not possible due to direction.\n> \n> So only U or L this turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about future moves to eat food.\n> \n> Available food: (2,5), (2,1) under body, (5,1)\n> \n> (2,5) at (2,5), life span 3, so can be eaten in turn 83,84,85.\n> \n> (2,1) at (2,1), occupied, life span 6, so we have time.\n> \n> (5,1) at (5,1), free, life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food under body, so we need to free that cell first.\n> \n> Now, let's see the snake body and how it moves.\n> \n> The snake is long, and the tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> If we move, the tail will move depending on the path.\n> \n> But to free (2,1), which is currently segment 12, we need the snake to move so that (2,1) is no longer occupied, which happens when the segment moves away, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the snake moves, the segment that was at (2,1) will move to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if we move the head, the body segments follow, so the segment at index i moves to the position of index i-1 previous, except head.\n> \n> So to free a specific cell, we need the segment that is on it to move to another cell.\n> \n> For (2,1), it is segment 12. When the snake moves, segment 12 will move to where segment 11 was, which is (2,2) currently? Positions: segment 11: (2,2), segment 12: (2,1)\n> \n> After one move, segment 11 will be at previous position of segment 10, which is (2,3)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> After a move, the new positions: head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for segment k, it moves to the position that segment k-1 was at before the move.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, segment 1 is at old head position, segment 2 at old segment 1 position, etc.\n> \n> Old positions: head at (4,3), seg1 at (5,3), seg2 at (6,3), ..., seg11 at (2,2), seg12 at (2,1), seg13 at (3,1), seg14 at (3,2), seg15 at (3,3)\n> \n> After one move, if head moves to new position, say P.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at P, seg1 at old head (4,3), seg2 at old seg1 (5,3), ..., seg11 at old seg10 position, which was (2,3), seg12 at old seg11 position (2,2), seg13 at old seg12 position (2,1), seg14 at old seg13 position (3,1), seg15 at old seg14 position (3,2)\n> \n> So after one move, the cell (2,1) is now occupied by seg13, which moved there from (2,1)? Old seg12 was at (2,1), new seg13 is at old seg12 position, which is (2,1), so (2,1) is still occupied by seg13 now.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) remains occupied unless the segment that is there moves away, but since the snake is long, (2,1) might be occupied for a while.\n> \n> To free (2,1), we need the tail to reach near there so that when the tail moves, it vacates.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,3), and (2,1) is occupied.\n> \n> The segment at (2,1) is seg12, and tail is seg15 at (3,3).\n> \n> When we move, the tail moves to the position of the previous segment, but it doesn't free (2,1) immediately.\n> \n> To free a cell under body, we need the snake to move such that the segment on that cell moves to another position, and that cell is not occupied by another segment immediately.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one cell at a time, when a segment moves from a cell, that cell is free at that moment, but the head can only move to it if it is adjacent and we choose to move there.\n> \n> But the head might not be adjacent.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at (2,1), we need that at some turn, when the segment that is on (2,1) moves away, and at that same turn, the head moves to (2,1). But the segment moving away means that the cell is free only if no other segment moves to it, but in the move, when the snake moves, multiple things happen at once.\n> \n> The rules don't specify the order, but typically in Snake, the head moves first to a new cell, then the body follows, so if the head moves to a cell that was just vacated by the tail, it can eat food there if present.\n> \n> But for a body cell, it's different.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> I think \"the body moves away\" means that in some turn, the segment that was on the food cell moves to a different cell, freeing it, and then later, the head moves onto it. But since the grid is discrete, it could be in the same turn or different.\n> \n> But in the same turn, when the head moves, the body also moves, so if a body segment moves away from a cell, that cell is free, and if the head moves to that same cell in the same turn, it should be possible to eat the food.\n> \n> But is that allowed? The rules say \"the body moves away\" and \"head moves onto the food cell\", which could be simultaneous.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it has to be different turns, the food might disappear or something.\n> \n> But let's assume it can be in the same turn.\n> \n> For example, if the segment on the food is moving away, and head moving to that cell, it should be ok.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,1), it is currently occupied by seg12.\n> \n> If we move in such a way that seg12 moves to a different cell, and at the same time, head moves to (2,1).\n> \n> But head is at (4,3), not adjacent to (2,1), so impossible to move head to (2,1) in one move.\n> \n> So we need to first get the head closer to (2,1), and also arrange the body so that the segment on (2,1) moves away when head is adjacent.\n> \n> This might be complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to ignore (2,1) for now and focus on other food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is at (2,5), free, and we can eat it if we go there.\n> \n> (5,1) at (5,1), free.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,1) but occupied.\n> \n> But (2,1) has value 1, same as others, so not more valuable.\n> \n> All have value 1.\n> \n> Life span different, but all positive.\n> \n> Now, let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, current turn 83, head at (4,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> If we move U to (4,4), or L to (3,3).\n> \n> If move L to (3,3), that is the current tail position, so after move, head at (3,3), and tail moves to old seg14 position, which was (3,2)?

instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake length increases by one, and the tail remains where it is for that turn.\n> \n> Then on subsequent moves, the tail moves as usual.\n> \n> But in terms of position: after eating, the head is at the new position, the body segments are shifted, and the tail is still at its old position, but now it's not the tail anymore; there's a new segment added.\n> \n> For example, positions before move: head at H, segment at B1, B2, ..., tail at T.\n> \n> Head moves to F (food cell), so new head at F.\n> \n> Then, the body: the first segment after head moves to old head H, second to old B1, etc., and since we eat, a new segment is added at old tail position T, so the new positions are: head at F, seg1 at H, seg2 at B1, ..., segN at B_{N-1}, and new seg_{N+1} at T.\n> \n> So the cell T is still occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,1), if tail is at (2,1), and head moves to (2,1), but head moving to (2,1) would be moving to the same cell as tail, which is occupied, so it should be collision before eating.\n> \n> The rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But that's when not eating food.\n> \n> If eating food, it's different.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Specifically, if head is adjacent to tail, and you move onto the tail cell to eat the food, then since you eat, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on the same cell after move, causing collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,1), moving to (2,1) which is tail and has food, and head is adjacent to tail, so eating it would cause death.\n> \n> Therefore, we cannot move to (2,1) from (3,1) because of tail reward danger.\n> \n> But in this position, from (3,1), we have no other moves;

Cannot move here (body collision).\n     - **Down (D)**: (3,1) - Occupied by tail (segment 15). Safe to move here (tail moves away).\n     - **Left (L)**: (2,2) - Occupied by body (segment 13). Cannot move here (body collision).\n     - **Right (R)**: (4,2) - Wall (internal obstacle). Cannot move here.\n\n2. **Possible Moves at Turn 85**:\n   - **U (Up)**: Not allowed (reverse direction from current D).\n   - **D (Down)**: Safe (tail moves away).\n   - **L (Left)**: Body collision.\n   - **R (Right)**: Wall collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Only possible move is **D (Down)** to (3,1).\n\n3. **Consequences of Moving Down (D) at Turn 85**:\n   - New head position: (3,1).\n   - New tail position: (2,1) (since the tail moves forward).\n   - Food at (2,1) is now under the new tail position.\n\n4. **Turn 86 State After Moving Down**:\n   - **Head**: (3,1)\n   - **Direction**: Still D (since we moved D).\n   - **Possible Moves**:\n     - **U (Up)**: (3,2) - Occupied by body (segment 1). Cannot move here (body collision and reverse direction).\n     - **D (Down)**: (3,0) - Wall (border). Cannot move here.\n     - **L (Left)**: (2,1) - Occupied by tail (segment 15) and has food.\n     - **R (Right)**: (4,1) - Wall (internal obstacle). Cannot move here.\n   - **Only Possible Move**: **L (Left)** to (2,1).\n     - **Outcome**: \n       - Eating the food at (2,1) (positive food, +1 score).\n       - Snake grows by 1 segment (tail does not move).\n       - New head and tail both at (2,1) → Collision → Death.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe snake is forced to move down to (3,1) at turn 85 to avoid immediate collisions or wall hits. This leads to an unavoidable death at turn 86 when the only possible move is left to (2,1), eating the food and causing a collision with the newly grown tail. \n\n### Final Action\n\\boxed{D} (Down) is the only possible move at turn 85. This action is unavoidable and leads to the snake's eventual death on the next turn, but it is the only legal move available.",

It's turn 85. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since borders are given.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is down. That means the snake is moving down, so from (3,2) to (3,3) would be down, but let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Next: (3,3) – so from head to this, it's moving up? No:\n> \n> (3,2) to (3,3): if y increases, that's up, but direction is given as D, which is down. Down is decreasing y? I think I have the coordinate system wrong.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement definitions: U (x,y+1) – so y+1 is up, I assume y increases upwards? But in many games, y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply y+1 is up.\n> \n> Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement constraints:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) – so increasing y is up.\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) – decreasing y is down.\n> \n> L: (x-1, y)\n> \n> R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> And walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So probably (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Since y=0 is a border, and U increases y, it might be that y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa. But in the snake positions, we have (3,2) and (3,3), and head direction down, so from (3,2) down to (3,1)? But positions are given as [(3,2), (3,3), ...] so (3,2) is head, then (3,3) is next, which is higher y, so up.\n> \n> But head direction is D, down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Snake positions list: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So from head to body: head at (3,2), then next segment at (3,3). Since the snake moves, the head was previously at some position, and moved to (3,2) with direction down.\n> \n> Direction is the current movement direction. So at turn 85, the snake is moving down, so from the previous position, it moved down to (3,2). The next segment is where the head was before.\n> \n> Let's see the positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), etc. So before moving down to (3,2), the head was at (3,3), and it moved down to (3,2). But (3,3) is the second position, which is the body segment behind the head.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment follows the previous one.\n> \n> At turn 85, the snake has just moved to these positions with head at (3,2) by moving down from the previous head position.\n> \n> Previous head position: since positions are listed, head is (3,2), and the second position is (3,3), so before moving, the head was at (3,3), and it moved down to (3,2).

So at turn 85, for (2,5), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 86? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N more turns, including turn t.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 2 at turn 85, it will be gone after turn 86.

(4,2) is an internal obstacle, so yes, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: down to (3,1). Is (3,1) free? (3,1) is the tail position, but in snake, moving to tail is ok because when snake moves, tail moves away, so head can move to where tail was, as long as no other body collision.\n> \n> According to rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, I think, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

It's turn 86, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the grid has rows y=0 to y=7 and columns x=0 to x=7, but cells like (0,0), (0,1), ..., (0,7), (7,0), etc., and (x,0), (x,7) for all x, are walls. Playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)] These are also walls, so I can't move to these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake has 16 segments. Head is at (3,1), and direction is D (down). Let's list the positions in order: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1). Tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), and head is at (3,1), moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down is impossible? y=0 is a wall, so (3,0) is out of bounds. But let's see the grid.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom wall? Typically, in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here since moving down decreases y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases up, decreases down? That's unusual.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — that means moving up increases y, so y=0 is the bottom row? Let's think.\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1), that implies that higher y is up, so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top.\n> \n> Similarly, D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> So the grid: x from 0 to 7, left to right. y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> But walls: x=0 (left wall), x=7 (right wall), y=0 (bottom wall), y=7 (top wall).

Since D is (x,y-1), from (3,1), down would be to (3,0), but (3,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so it's invalid.

But in the input, it says \"value1, life_span1\" for each, but in the list, it's (x,y, value, life_span)\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 5, 1, 1) - (2, 1, 3, 1) - (5, 1, 6, 1) - (2, 4, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (2,5): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - Food at (2,1): value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): value=6, life_span=1\n> \n> - Food at (2,4): value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> All have life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1) with life_span=1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, others have life_span=1, so all food will disappear after this turn except... all have life_span=1? (2,5,1,1) life_span=1, (2,1,3,1) life_span=1, (5,1,6,1) life_span=1, (2,4,9,1) life_span=1. All life_span=1, so if not eaten on turn 86, they disappear forever.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,1), and I can only move to (2,1), which has food with value 3.\n> \n> If I move to (2,1), I eat that food.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> First, is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,1), tail at (2,1). Are they adjacent? (3,1) and (2,1) are adjacent horizontally, since |dx|=1, dy=0.\n> \n> So head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, tail cell (2,1) has positive food, value=3>0.\n> \n> If I eat it, what happens?\n> \n> When I eat food, the snake grows: so after moving to the food cell, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to food cell, eats it, then the tail remains, so new tail is added at the position where head moved, but since head is there, the segment is added, so the tail stays in place, and the body extends.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,1), which is current tail and has food.\n> \n> After eating: head moves to (2,1), eats the food, so the snake grows. Therefore, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end. But the end was (2,1), so now head is at (2,1), and the previous segments: old head (3,1) becomes body, old segment 1 (3,2) becomes next, and so on, up to old segment 15 (2,1) was tail, but since we ate food, the tail stays, so the snake now has an extra segment.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,1), then body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), ..., all the way to the old tail (2,1) is now part of body? Let's list.\n> \n> Old positions: 0: (3,1) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,4), 12: (2,4), 13: (2,3), 14: (2,2), 15: (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (2,1) and eating food:\n> \n> New head: (2,1)\n> \n> Then, since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the body includes all old segments from 0 to 15, but segment 0 (old head) is now the first body segment at (3,1), and segment 15 (old tail) remains at (2,1)? But head is now at (2,1), so (2,1) has both head and the old tail segment? Conflict.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats food, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So new segments: head at new position (2,1)\n> \n> Then the body: all the old body segments in order, including the old tail, so: old head (3,1) becomes body segment 1, old segment 1 (3,2) becomes body segment 2, ..., old segment 14 (2,2) becomes body segment 15, and old tail (2,1) becomes body segment 16? But (2,1) is where head is now.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Better: the snake grows when it eats, so the length increases by one. The head moves to the new cell, and the tail remains in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> - New head position: the cell where it moved, here (2,1)\n> \n> - The rest of the body: all the previous positions, from head to tail, are kept, so the previous head becomes the new segment 1, previous segment 1 becomes new segment 2, ..., previous tail becomes new segment n, and since we ate, there is a new tail at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk where P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell Q, then new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}  (tail was Pk, but it is removed, so new tail is P_{k-1})\n> \n> With eating: head moves to Q, eats food, so new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk  (all previous segments kept, so new tail is Pk)\n> \n> In this case, Q = (2,1), which is exactly Pk, the current tail position.\n> \n> So after move: new head at (2,1), new body segments: P0 = (3,1), P1 = (3,2), ..., P14 = (2,2), P15 = (2,1) but P15 is (2,1), which is the same as new head position (2,1), so collision immediately.\n> \n> Yes, that's the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n> \n> Specifically, since head is moving to the tail cell, and it has food, eating it causes the head to be at (2,1) and the new body includes the old tail at (2,1), so they are at the same position, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,1) to eat the food would kill the snake.\n> \n> Moreover, since head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, it's dangerous.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (2,1) because it would cause collision.\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (2,1) is the only possible move? But if I move there and eat, I die.\n> \n> If I don't eat, but I have to move.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, and die.\n> \n> Is there a way to not eat it? No, if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it automatically.\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (2,1) would force me to eat and die.\n> \n> But earlier I thought moving to (2,1) is possible since tail moves away, but that's only if no food eaten. Here, since food is there, I eat and grow, causing collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,1) is fatal.\n> \n> But what are my other options? U, D, R are all invalid: U to body, D to wall, R to wall.\n> \n> L to (2,1) is fatal.\n> \n> So no possible safe move? But that can't be right; I must have missed something.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move to a cell that is not a wall or body.\n> \n> But from (3,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) - snake body\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) - wall\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) - has food, but moving there causes death due to tail reward danger\n> \n> - Right: (4,1) - internal obstacle wall\n> \n> All seem invalid.\n> \n> But (2,1) is the only cell I can physically move to, but it kills me.\n> \n> Perhaps the tail is not considered for collision when moving, but the danger is specific.\n> \n> Maybe I should consider that the food at (2,1) is under the snake's body, but it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> In this case, (2,1) is the tail, so it is part of snake.\n> \n> But the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.
