However, eating the food at (6,4) ensures we don't \"waste\" it (since it disappears after this turn), while the food at (6,6) could theoretically be eaten later (though we can't in this scenario).\n\n### Decision\nGiven that both moves lead to death, the optimal choice is to **move Down (D) to (6,4)** to eat the food that will disappear after this turn. This maximizes the immediate reward since the other food can persist (though it won't matter in this case).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{D}",

Internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6), (1,4), (5,6), (4,2)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] (head at (6,4), tail at (6,3))\n  - Current direction: Down (D)\n- **Food**:\n  - Only one piece at (6,6) with value +1 and lifespan 8 turns (disappears after Turn 55)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 48\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,4), moving Down (D). The possible moves from here are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: Move to (6,3)\n   - (6,3) is currently the tail. According to rules, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,4)\n   - (5,4) is occupied by the snake's body (not the tail), so this would cause a collision.\n   \n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,4)\n   - x=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n   \n4. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,5)\n   - (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Also, moving Up is the reverse of the current direction (Down), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid and safe move at Turn 48 is **Down (D)** to (6,3).\n\n### After Moving Down at Turn 48\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,3)\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (6,3)\n  - Body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n  - Tail: (5,3) (since the old tail at (6,3) is now the head)\n- **Direction**: Still Down (D) (assuming direction is updated to the last move)\n  \nNow, let's look at possible moves at Turn 49 from (6,3):\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (6,2)\n   - (6,2) is not occupied by the snake or walls/obstacles. Safe.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is the tail. Safe to move here as the tail will move away.\n   \n3. **Right (R)**: (7,3)\n   - x=7 is a wall. Invalid.\n   \n4. **Up (U)**: (6,4)\n   - (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body. Also, reverse of Down is not allowed.\n\n**Possible Moves at Turn 49**: Down (D) to (6,2) or Left (L) to (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating Moves at Turn 49\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (6,2)**\n- New Head: (6,2)\n- Body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n- Tail: (4,3)\n  \nFrom (6,2), possible next moves (Turn 50):\n- Down to (6,1)\n- Left to (5,2)\n- Up to (6,3) (body, collision)\n  \nThis path seems to lead the snake downward, away from the food at (6,6).\n\n**Option 2: Move Left to (5,3)**\n- New Head: (5,3)\n- Body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n- Tail: (4,3)\n  \nFrom (5,3), possible next moves (Turn 50):\n- Down to (5,2)\n- Left to (4,3) (tail, safe)\n- Up to (5,4) (body, collision)\n  \nThis path moves the snake leftward, potentially opening up more space.\n\n### Deciding on Turn 49 Move\n\nGiven that the food at (6,6) is blocked by the snake's body at (6,5) and (6,4), and it's unlikely to reach it within the remaining lifespan (until Turn 55), the priority is to avoid collisions and survive as long as possible.\n\nMoving Left at Turn 49 seems better as it starts moving the snake away from the crowded right side, potentially giving more room to maneuver in the future.\n\n### Subsequent Moves\n\nAssuming we choose Left at Turn 49 to (5,3):\n\n- **Turn 50**: From (5,3)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,2)\n    - Left to (4,3) (tail, safe)\n  - Choosing Down to (5,2) to explore more space.\n\n- **Turn 51**: From (5,2)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,1)\n    - Left to (4,2) (obstacle)\n    - Right to (6,2)\n  - Choosing Down to (5,1).\n\n- **Turn 52**: From (5,1)\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down to (5,0) (wall)\n    - Left to (4,1) (obstacle)\n    - Right to (6,1)\n  - Choosing Right to (6,1).\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action for Turn 48 is to move Down (D), as it's the only safe and valid move. The subsequent moves are planned to navigate the snake towards open spaces to avoid collisions, acknowledging that the food at (6,6) is currently unreachable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is currently the tail of the snake. Moving here is safe because the tail will move away unless we eat food (which we're not here).\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is not a wall or part of the snake's body (other than the tail), so it's safe.\n3. **Left (L)**: (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is an internal obstacle (wall), so this move would cause a collision.\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,2)\n   - (6,2) is the first body segment after the head, so moving here would cause a collision. Also, moving right is the opposite of the current left direction, which is not allowed (\"no instant reverse\").\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **Up (U)** and **Down (D)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Move Up (U) to (5,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3)\n- **New Direction**: Up (U)\n- **Body Movement**:\n  - The tail (5,3) moves away, so no collision.\n  - The new body segments will follow the head's previous positions.\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (5,3), direction U:\n    - U to (5,4): (5,4) is a body segment (from initial positions), so collision.\n    - D to (5,2): Opposite of current direction (U), not allowed.\n    - L to (4,3): (4,3) is the new tail (after movement), safe.\n    - R to (6,3): (6,3) is a body segment, collision.\n  - Only safe move: L to (4,3).\n\nThis path seems restrictive, leading us to move left to the tail repeatedly, which might not be optimal for accessing food.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,1)\n- **New Direction**: Down (D)\n- **Body Movement**:\n  - (5,1) is free, so no collision.\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (5,1), direction D:\n    - U to (5,2): Opposite of current direction (D), not allowed.\n    - D to (5,0): y=0 is a wall, collision.\n    - L to (4,1): (4,1) is a wall, collision.\n    - R to (6,1): (6,1) has food, and is free.\n  - Only safe move: R to (6,1) to eat the food.\n\nEating at (6,1):\n- **New Head Position**: (6,1)\n- **Snake Growth**: Length increases by 1 (new tail stays at (4,3)).\n- **Next Possible Moves**:\n  - From (6,1), direction R:\n    - U to (6,2): (6,2) is a body segment, collision.\n    - D to (6,0): y=0 is a wall, collision.\n    - L to (5,1): (5,1) is a body segment, collision.\n    - R to (7,1): x=7 is a wall, collision.\n  - All moves lead to death on the next turn.\n\nThis path leads to immediate death after eating the food, which is not desirable.\n\n### Choosing the Safer Path\n\nGiven that moving Down (D) leads to certain death after eating, the safer option is to move Up (U) to (5,3), even though it's restrictive. This avoids immediate death and keeps the snake alive longer, allowing for potential future opportunities to access other food items like (6,3) once the snake's body moves away from it.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 65\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Cannot move here (body collision).\n     - **Down (D)**: (3,1) - Occupied by tail (segment 15). Safe to move here (tail moves away).\n     - **Left (L)**: (2,2) - Occupied by body (segment 13). Cannot move here (body collision).\n     - **Right (R)**: (4,2) - Wall (internal obstacle). Cannot move here.\n\n2. **Possible Moves at Turn 85**:\n   - **U (Up)**: Not allowed (reverse direction from current D).\n   - **D (Down)**: Safe (tail moves away).\n   - **L (Left)**: Body collision.\n   - **R (Right)**: Wall collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Only possible move is **D (Down)** to (3,1).\n\n3. **Consequences of Moving Down (D) at Turn 85**:\n   - New head position: (3,1).\n   - New tail position: (2,1) (since the tail moves forward).\n   - Food at (2,1) is now under the new tail position.\n\n4. **Turn 86 State After Moving Down**:\n   - **Head**: (3,1)\n   - **Direction**: Still D (since we moved D).\n   - **Possible Moves**:\n     - **U (Up)**: (3,2) - Occupied by body (segment 1). Cannot move here (body collision and reverse direction).\n     - **D (Down)**: (3,0) - Wall (border). Cannot move here.\n     - **L (Left)**: (2,1) - Occupied by tail (segment 15) and has food.\n     - **R (Right)**: (4,1) - Wall (internal obstacle). Cannot move here.\n   - **Only Possible Move**: **L (Left)** to (2,1).\n     - **Outcome**: \n       - Eating the food at (2,1) (positive food, +1 score).\n       - Snake grows by 1 segment (tail does not move).\n       - New head and tail both at (2,1) → Collision → Death.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe snake is forced to move down to (3,1) at turn 85 to avoid immediate collisions or wall hits. This leads to an unavoidable death at turn 86 when the only possible move is left to (2,1), eating the food and causing a collision with the newly grown tail. \n\n### Final Action\n\\boxed{D} (Down) is the only possible move at turn 85. This action is unavoidable and leads to the snake's eventual death on the next turn, but it is the only legal move available.",
