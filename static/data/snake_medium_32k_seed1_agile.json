I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> **Current State:**\n> \n> - Turn: t1 = 0\n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are walls. Internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> - Snake Positions: Only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is just the head right now, since it's a single position. Length 1.\n> - Snake Head Direction: L (left).

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, it's just the head. Eating food will increase its length.

So only walls or obstacles to worry about.\n> - Walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> **Food Mechanics:**\n> \n> - Positive food: +1 score, length +1\n> - Food can be under body, but only eaten when head moves to it after body moves away. But here, no body yet.\n> - Tail Reward Danger: If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is part of snake, so if tail has food, it means food is under the tail segment. But in this case, since snake is length 1, the head is the tail, but when it moves, if it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move immediately.\n> \n> I need to think carefully about the initial move.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> \n> - Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So 8x8 grid? Coordinates: (0,0) to (7,7), inclusive? Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are within the grid.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3), head direction L.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> All food has life_span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including current turn? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, food with life_span N will disappear after N turns, so on turn t + N it's gone.\n> \n> Since t1=0, food will be there until turn 10, I think? Let's see: if life_span is 10 at turn 0, after turn 0 it becomes 9, after turn 1 it becomes 8, ..., after turn 9 it becomes 1, after turn 10 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn 10 or end? The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so I think after each turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"Disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span N, after turn t, life_span becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as life_span >0 when head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But since we're at turn 0, life_span 10, it will last until turn 9, I think. At turn 0, life_span is 10, meaning it has 10 turns left including this one. After turn 0, life_span becomes 9, so at turn 9, life_span is 1, and after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly for all food.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (3,3), direction L. So from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, so cannot move R (right) because that would be opposite to L (left). Current direction is L, so moving R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). R is forbidden.\n> \n> Now, let's see the positions:\n> \n> - Moving L (left) from (3,3) to (2,3)\n> \n> - Moving U (up) to (3,4)\n> \n> - Moving D (down) to (3,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Walls: (2,3) is x=2,y=3, not border (border is x=0,7 or y=0,7), so (2,3) is within 1-6? x=2, min x is 1? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are safe, similarly y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 playable.\n> \n> (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, safe.\n> \n> (2,3): x=2, y=3, not border, no internal obstacle listed, obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2). (2,3) not in that list, so safe.\n> \n> (3,4): x=3,y=4, not border. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3,y=2, not border, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> Also, no body segments, so no collision risk.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> (1,6): x=1,y=6, which is playable? x=1 not wall, y=6 not wall, since walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,6) is corner but not wall? x=1 is not x=0 or x=7, y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so yes, playable. Similarly (2,1): x=2,y=1, playable. (4,6): x=4,y=6, playable.\n> \n> But (1,6) is at y=6, which is adjacent to y=7 wall, but the cell itself is not wall unless specified. Similarly.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Since snake is length 1, moving to a food will increase length to 2, and then I have a body segment.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8 cells, but rows and columns from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7) all walls, (7,0) to (7,7) walls, (0,0) to (7,0) walls, (0,7) to (7,7) walls. But since it's borders, the playable area is inner 6x6? No, cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but (1,0) would be wall because y=0, etc.\n> \n> Specifically, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall, so cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So playable cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except the obstacles.\n> \n> List obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n> \n> Now snake at (3,3)\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> I need to choose a move for turn 0.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L\n> \n> Move L to (2,3): not food, no growth.\n> \n> Move U to (3,4): not food.\n> \n> Move D to (3,2): not food.\n> \n> None of the immediate moves land on food, so I won't eat food on this turn no matter what.\n> \n> Then, after moving, the snake will have a body? No, since I didn't eat, length remains 1, so next turn, it's still just head, but position changed.\n> \n> When I move, if I don't eat, the snake moves to the new position, and since length is 1, the tail moves with it, so still one segment.\n> \n> But when I eat food, length increases, so next time I move, the tail stays or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, the head moves to new cell, and if no food, tail moves one step, so length same. If food, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, initial length 1: if I move to a food cell, I eat it, so head moves to food, length becomes 2, and the new position has head and tail at same point? But then next move, the tail will stay or move?\n> \n> Typically, when snake eats, head moves to food, and tail doesn't move, so snake grows. For length 1: head at position, eats food, now head at food position, and tail is at previous position? But since it was alone, it's a bit special.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n> \n> Also, positions: after eating, the new segment is added, so for first food, after eating, snake becomes two segments: head at food position, and tail at previous head position.\n> \n> Then next move, when head moves, tail moves from that position.\n> \n> In this case, since no food at (2,3), (3,4), or (3,2), moving to any of them won't eat food, so after move, snake still at new position with length 1.\n> \n> For example, if I move L to (2,3), then new snake position: [(2,3)], direction L if I moved L, or whatever I moved.\n> \n> Head direction updates to the direction I moved.\n> \n> Then turn 1, I can move from there.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead to reach food.\n> \n> Food locations: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is at top-left, y=6 is high y, since y increases up? Direction U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), U: y+1, so y increases upward.\n> \n> So (1,6) is x=1, y=6, which is near top row, since y=6 is one below y=7 wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is x=2, y=1, near bottom, y=1 above y=0 wall.\n> \n> (4,6) is x=4, y=6, near top.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3), which is center.\n> \n> Now, distances:\n> \n> To (1,6): from (3,3), delta x= -2, delta y= +3, so Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = 2+3=5 moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, to (2,1): dx= -1, dy= -2, distance 1+2=3 moves.\n> \n> To (4,6): dx= +1, dy= +3, distance 1+3=4 moves.\n> \n> (2,1) is closest, only 3 moves away.\n> \n> But there are obstacles, so path might not be direct.\n> \n> Also, life_span is 10, plenty of time, so I can go for closest food.\n> \n> But (2,1) is at (2,1), which has an obstacle? Obstacles are (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4). (2,1) is not an obstacle, so it's free.\n> \n> (2,1) is a food position, not obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacles are separate.\n> \n> Now, to reach (2,1) from (3,3).\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2), then from there, I can move L to (2,2), then D to (2,1)? (2,2) to (2,1) is down, y-1.\n> \n> (2,1) is at y=1, which is playable.\n> \n> But at (2,2), is there obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) to (2,2): if I go directly.\n> \n> But I need to consider the direction for no reverse.\n> \n> At turn 0, snake at (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> I move, say, D to (3,2). Then new head position (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Then turn 1, from (3,2), I can move D, L, or R? Current direction D, so cannot move U (up, opposite).\n> \n> Allowed: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> Then turn 2, from (2,2), current direction L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n> \n> Then to (2,1), I need to move D (down) to (2,1).\n> \n> But at turn 2, from (2,2), if direction L, I can move D to (2,1).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> From (3,2), I could move directly to (2,1) if possible, but (3,2) to (2,1) is left and down, not adjacent horizontally or vertically; it's diagonal, not allowed. Moves must be U,D,L,R to adjacent cells.\n> \n> So from (3,2), to reach (2,1), I need to go to (2,2) first or (3,1), but (3,1) is not food, and y=1, x=3.\n> \n> (3,1) is playable? x=3,y=1, not border, obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1) are obstacles, but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But food is at (2,1), not (3,1).\n> \n> So path: (3,3) -> D to (3,2) -> L to (2,2) -> D to (2,1). That's 3 moves, reach on turn 2? Let's see turns.\n> \n> Turn 0: start at (3,3), move to new position.\n> \n> After move, position updated.\n> \n> Turn 0: I choose action, move to new cell, if food, eat it.\n> \n> Here, no food at possible moves, so after turn 0, snake at new position, length 1.\n> \n> Then turn 1, move from there, and so on.\n> \n> To reach (2,1) in fewest moves:\n> \n> From (3,3), if I move D to (3,2) on turn 0.\n> \n> Then turn 1, at (3,2), move L to (2,2) (since (2,2) is adjacent, and not wall or obstacle).\n> \n> Then turn 2, at (2,2), move D to (2,1), and (2,1) has food, so I eat it on turn 2.\n> \n> Similarly, I could go through other paths, but this seems direct.\n> \n> Now, what about other foods? (1,6) is farther, (4,6) also.\n> \n> But (2,1) is close, and I can reach in 3 turns.\n> \n> Life_span 10, so no issue.\n> \n> But I need to think about after eating, the snake grows, and I have to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but since tail will be at (2,2) when I eat at (2,1), head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), which is adjacent, but the food is at (2,1), which I'm eating, so after eating, the tail is still at (2,2), and head at (2,1), so they are adjacent, but not colliding because tail is behind.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> But in this case, when I move to (2,1), the tail is at (2,2), and the food is at (2,1), which is under the head now, not under the tail. The tail cell is (2,2), which may or may not have food, but here no food at (2,2), so no issue.\n> \n> After I eat, the tail is at (2,2), head at (2,1), so not adjacent? (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Positions: after turn 2, I move head to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it. Head now at (2,1), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the previous position becomes body segment. Before move, snake was at [(2,2)] (since turn 1 ended at (2,2), length 1? Let's track.\n> \n> Turn 0 start: snake at [(3,3)], length 1.\n> \n> Turn 0: move D to (3,2). Since no food, snake now at [(3,2)], still length 1.\n> \n> Turn 1: move L to (2,2). No food there, so snake now at [(2,2)], length 1.\n> \n> Turn 2: move D to (2,1). Now (2,1) has food, so I eat it. Head moves to (2,1), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so new snake positions: head at (2,1), tail at previous position (2,2). So snake is now [(2,1), (2,2)], with head at (2,1), tail at (2,2). Direction after move is D.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), so they are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: is the tail cell, (2,2), have food? But (2,2) has no food; the food was at (2,1), which I just ate. So (2,2) is just a body segment, no food. So no danger.\n> \n> Moreover, head and tail are adjacent, but not colliding because in snake, head can be adjacent to tail without colliding; collision only if head moves into a body segment, which tail is, but since tail will move when head moves, it's ok, as long as not moving directly into it in a way that causes collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So when head moves, tail moves, so if head moves to where tail was, and tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,1), with tail at (2,2), I can move, say, L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) or U to (2,2)? U to (2,2) is where tail is.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2), which is occupied by tail, but since tail will move to the previous position or something, it might be ok.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is not food, tail moves to the next position, so the cell that was tail becomes free.\n> \n> But if head moves to the cell that was tail, and tail moves away, then head is now there, and tail is gone from there.\n> \n> For example, positions: head at H, tail at T.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, say N.\n> \n> If N is not food, tail moves to the cell after T in the body, but since only two segments, tail moves to where head was? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake segments: [head, body, ..., tail]\n> \n> When head moves to new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, tail is removed from its position, and head added to new position, so tail cell is freed.\n> \n> - If food, tail is not removed, head added to new position, so snake grows.\n> \n> In case of two segments: before move, positions [H, T]\n> \n> After move head to N:\n> \n> - If N not food, then new positions [N, H], since tail moves to where head was.\n> \n> - If N food, then new positions [N, H, T]? No.\n> \n> Typically: the body is a list. When head moves to new cell, it becomes new head. If no food eaten, the tail is removed (so last segment is deleted). If food eaten, tail is not removed, so a new segment is added at head, effectively.\n> \n> So for two segments: positions [H, T]\n> \n> Head moves to N:\n> \n> - If N not food: new positions [N, H] (tail was T, removed, so H becomes the tail?

The body: after move, the new body has head at N, and the segment that was at H is now the body or tail.\n> \n> Since only two segments, after move to N with no food, snake becomes [N, H], so head at N, tail at H.\n> \n> If with food, snake becomes [N, H, T], but T was tail, so now [N, H] with H as body?

It's turn 1, and the snake is on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so an 8x8 grid? Walls are at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, an 8x8 grid with borders as walls. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(3,2)].

Since it's the only segment, direction might not matter much yet, but I need to remember for movement constraints.\n> \n> Food positions: each is given as (x, y, life_span, value).

Life span decreases each turn, starting from now, I think. Since it's turn 1, life_span 9 means it will disappear after 9 turns, so on turn 10 it's gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the turn it's spawned.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

Since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so segment 1 is removed. The new tail is... but there was only one body segment, so after removal, only the head at (2,2), and no tail, so snake becomes length 1 at (2,2).\n> \n> But that means the body segment is lost, which is not correct for snake game. I think I'm missing something.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if not eating, the tail is left, so the snake moves forward by one cell.\n> \n> For example, from positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n> \n> Move head to new cell C.\n> \n> If C not food, then new positions: [C, A] and B is removed, so tail was B, now tail is A, head is C.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (2,1), (2,2) ], move head to a new cell, say (2,2) is not new, it's the same as tail.\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), that cell is currently occupied by tail, so it's not empty.\n> \n> But the rule says it's allowed because tail moves away.\n> \n> After move, the head is at (2,2), and the tail was at (2,2), but it moves, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> The new positions: the head is now at (2,2), and the previous head (2,1) becomes the new tail, so positions [ (2,2), (2,1) ]?

So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,4), body at (5,3). So the snake is only two segments long right now.

Let me check the input.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 6, 5, 1) - (2, 1, 5, 1) - (4, 6, 5, 1) - (6, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think this is (x, y, life_span, value).

Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is 5 at turn 5, it will be gone by turn 6? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if a food has life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, the countdown is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.

I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me define: at the beginning of turn t, each food has a remaining life span. When the snake head moves to a food cell during turn t, if remaining life span > 0, it is eaten. After the turn, the remaining life span decreases by 1 for all food. If after decrease, life span becomes 0, the food disappears.\n> \n> For food with initial life span L at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> At turn 5:\n> \n> - (1,6): life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9?

If not eaten, after turn 5, life span becomes 4, can be eaten on turn 6 with life span 4, and so on, until turn 9 if life span 1 on turn 9, eaten on turn 9, then after decrease to 0, disappears.\n> \n> But since it can be eaten only once, once eaten, it's removed.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): life span 5 at turn 5, same as above.\n> \n> (4,6): life span 5 at turn 5.\n> \n> (6,6): life span 9 at turn 5, so it will last longer.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), direction U (up), so last move was up to (5,4) from (5,3), I assume, since body is at (5,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,4), (5,3)], head first, so head at (5,4), tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Head direction U, meaning it moved up to (5,4), so from (5,3) to (5,4), so current direction is up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction, so since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down), because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 5: U, L, or R.

It's turn 6. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, I should sketch this grid mentally to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Internal walls are at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4). Head direction is U, which is up. So, the snake is vertical, head at (5,5), tail at (5,4), so it's facing upwards.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. Life spans: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) have 4 turns left, including current turn? The life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 6, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, after turn t, it decreases to N-1. So it exists until the turn when life span becomes 0. For example, at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears. So with L=4 at turn 6, it will be there for turns 6,7,8,9? At turn 6, L=4; after turn 6, L=3; after turn 7, L=2; after turn 8, L=1; after turn 9, L=0, so it disappears after turn 9? But the turn it is eaten, if eaten on turn t, it's consumed before decreasing life span.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"can be eaten only if head moves onto it on that turn.\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,6) with life span 4 at turn 6: it can be eaten on any turn from 6 to when life span >0. After turn 6, life span becomes 3; after turn 7, 2; etc. So with life span 4 at turn 6, it exists until the end of turn 9, meaning it can be eaten on turns 6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) has life span 8, so it lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (5,5), direction U. Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse. Current direction U, so I cannot move D next. Allowed moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> Moving U from (5,5) would go to (5,6).\n> \n> But let's see the grid. Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so (5,6) is within bounds? y=0 to y=7, so y=6 is fine, x=5 is between 1 and 6, I think. x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y coordinates: 1,2,3,4,5,6 are valid, since y=0 and y=7 are out.\n> \n> Similarly, x: 1,2,3,4,5,6 valid, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,5), body (5,4).

Are they adjacent? Yes, vertically adjacent, since (5,5) and (5,4) differ by y=1.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. So (5,5) and (5,4) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Now, is there food on the tail cell? Tail cell is (5,4). Food positions: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6). None at (5,4), so no food on tail. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> But if I eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so new segment added, tail stays, but then next turn tail moves.\n> \n> The rule: when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.

After moving U, the head direction becomes U, so I can move U, L, R from there, not D.\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall, so (5,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> - L: to (4,6)\n> \n> - R: to (6,6)\n> \n> D: but D is down, which might be reverse? Current direction after moving U to (5,6) is U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.

Snake positions: after move, when no food, tail moves.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When eating food, head moves to food, new segment added at head, so tail doesn't move; snake grows.\n> \n> Initially, turn 6 start: snake at [(5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> After action, say move to new head position.\n> \n> Case 1: no food eaten.\n> \n> After move, head is at new position, the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, and so on, tail moves from its position.\n> \n> So positions update: new head, then previous head becomes body, previous tail position is vacated.\n> \n> With two segments: head moves to new, body moves to where head was, so tail is now at where body was, but since only two, after move, positions: [new_head, old_head]\n> \n> For example, if move U to (5,6), positions become [(5,6), (5,5)]\n> \n> Then if move L to (4,6), which has food, so eat, snake grows, positions: head to (4,6), and since eating, new segment, so positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]?

No: when eating, the snake grows by adding a segment at the tail end, but the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> So positions: head moves to new position (food), and the tail stays where it is, so the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> For example, from [H, T], move to food cell F: positions become [F, H, T] since T stays.\n> \n> Then next turn, tail moves when not eating.\n> \n> Similarly, if multiple segments.\n> \n> In this case, start turn 6: positions [(5,5), (5,4)] head at (5,5)\n> \n> If move U to (5,6), no food, so new positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5), tail moved away from (5,4), so positions [(5,6), (5,5)]\n> \n> (5,4) is now empty.\n> \n> Then if from there move to (4,6) which has food, so eat: head to (4,6), body at (5,6), and since eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]?

It's turn 7, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so the grid is 8x8 since it includes 0 to 7 inclusive? Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7 means 8 columns, y from 0 to 7 means 8 rows. Walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (5,5). Head direction is Up, so it's moving north, meaning y increases? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), so up increases y, down decreases y? Let me check: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" – so U: (x, y+1), which means moving up increases the y-coordinate. In grid terms, usually y=0 is bottom or top? But in this notation, since U is (x,y+1), it implies that y increases upwards, like in Cartesian coordinates. I think I should just follow the given: U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x.\n> \n> So head at (5,6), moving up, so last move was U. Now, I need to choose the next move.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 7? Value is +1 for all? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 6, 3, 1) - (2, 1, 3, 1) - (4, 6, 3, 1) - (6, 6, 7, 1) - (4, 1, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> The format is (x,y, life_span, value). And value is 1 for all, which is positive food, since it says \"value1\" etc., and in the description, positive food has value +1.\n> \n> All food here has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned in this state.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,6) life 3, (2,1) life 3, (4,6) life 3, (6,6) life 7, (4,1) life 10.\n> \n> Current turn is 7, so life span decreases each turn, including current. So for food at (1,6), life span 3, it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose food appears at turn T with life_span N. Then at turn T, countdown is N. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if countdown is C at a turn, it will disappear after C turns, meaning at the start of turn when countdown becomes 0.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given as life_span, which is the current remaining life.\n> \n> For example, at turn 7, food at (1,6) has life_span 3, meaning it has 3 turns left, including turn 7. So after turn 7, countdown becomes 2; after turn 8, countdown 1; after turn 9, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 10 or at the end of turn 9? I need to know when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, in such games, food is present during the turn when countdown > 0, and can be eaten when head moves to it during that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, here: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, meaning it will be gone after N turns have passed.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N: it is present at turn t, and will disappear after N turns, so it is not present at turn t + N.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> At turn t + N, it is gone.\n> \n> For (1,6) at turn 7, life_span 3: present at turns 7,8,9. Disappears after turn 9, so not there at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life 3: turns 7,8,9\n> \n> (4,6) life 3: turns 7,8,9\n> \n> (6,6) life 7: present from turn 7 to 13 (since 7+7-1=13, disappears after turn 13)\n> \n> (4,1) life 10: turns 7 to 16.\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(5,6), (5,5)], head at (5,6), direction U (up, so y+1).\n> \n> Current possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite to U, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from U, I cannot go D; I can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, the grid: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I cannot move to those coordinates.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake body: head (5,6), tail (5,5). Since only two segments, moving to (5,5) might be possible because tail will move away, but let's see.\n> \n> If I move to a cell, and it's occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it might be ok, as long as after move, head doesn't collide with body.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – none at (4,6), so (4,6) is free and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): has food, value +1, life 7.\n> \n> (6,6): x=6, y=6. Borders: x=6, but x=7 is border? Border cells: x=0 or x=7, so x=6 is not border, y=6 not border.

When you eat, the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat food, you move the head to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so you add a new segment.\n> \n> So after eating: head at (1,6), body at (2,6), and the previous tail position (4,6) becomes part of body, and new tail is not moved, so positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move: positions (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) with head at (2,6)\n> \n> Move head to (1,6), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> Then, the head moves to (1,6), the first body segment moves to old head position (2,6), but since we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,6), body (2,6) [from old head], body (3,6) [from old body], and the old tail (4,6) remains, so now snake has four segments: head (1,6), body1 (2,6), body2 (3,6), tail (4,6)\n> \n> Length increased.\n> \n> Now, is there tail reward danger?

Obstacles: (2,4) is at (2,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Then to (4,3), (4,2), but (4,2) free? Then to (4,1), but (4,1) has food, but I can eat it later, life span 9.\n> \n> But to (2,1), from (4,2) I need to go left to (3,2), (2,2), then down to (2,1), but (2,1) is at y=1, and there is obstacle at (1,2), but (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> But (2,1) must be eaten by turn 9, and it's turn 8 now, so from (4,6), even if I go directly, it takes at least |4-2| + |6-1| = 2+5=7 moves, so I can't reach it by turn 9. Turn 8,9 only two turns, I can move twice, so from (4,6) on turn 8, after two moves, at best I might be at (4,4) or (3,5), not close to (2,1). So impossible to eat (2,1) before it disappears. Similarly, (1,6) can be reached in two moves: turn 8 to (3,6), turn 9 to (2,6), then on turn 9 I can be at (2,6), but to eat (1,6) I need to be at (1,6) on turn 9, which requires moving to it on turn 9, but from (2,6) on turn 9, I can move to (1,6) if I go left.\n> \n> From (4,6) on turn 8, if I go L to (3,6), then on turn 9 I can go L to (2,6) or to (1,6) if possible, but (1,6) is adjacent to (2,6), not to (3,6), so I need to be at (2,6) first.\n> \n> On turn 9, from (3,6), I can move to (2,6), then I am at (2,6), but to eat (1,6), I need to move to (1,6) on that turn, but I can only move to adjacent cells, so on turn 9, if I move to (2,6), I am not eating (1,6) yet. Then on turn 10, food is gone.\n> \n> To eat on turn 9, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (1,6) on turn 9 and move to it.\n> \n> But on turn 8, I am at (4,6), after move to (3,6), I am at (3,6) at end of turn 8.\n> \n> Start of turn 9, I am at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (1,6); (1,6) is two cells away.\n> \n> So I can only move to (2,6) or (3,5) on turn 9.\n> \n> If I move to (2,6) on turn 9, I am at (2,6), which is adjacent to (1,6), but I eat food only when I move onto it, so on turn 9, I move to (2,6), not to (1,6), so I don't eat it. Then on turn 10, food disappears, so I miss it.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat (1,6) because I can't reach it in one move from turn 8 position. From (4,6) to (1,6) is three cells away, and I have only two moves (turn 8 and 9) to eat it by turn 9. But after two moves, I can be at (2,6) on turn 9, but not on (1,6). So I cannot eat (1,6) at all; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,1): even farther, impossible to reach by turn 9.\n> \n> So both short-life foods are unreachable; I should ignore them and focus on long-term survival and other foods.\n> \n> (1,6) and (2,1) cannot be eaten because I can't reach them in the remaining time with the current position.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (6,6) and (4,1)\n> \n> (6,6) is at x=6,y=6, which is near the snake.\n> \n> From (4,6), I can go towards (6,6), but I can't move right directly because body is at (5,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,6) or D to (4,5)\n> \n> If I go D to (4,5), then I can go right or down, etc.\n> \n> But to reach (6,6), I need to go right and up, but from (4,6), moving down to (4,5) might not be efficient.\n> \n> Also, there is obstacle at (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,6) is free.\n> \n> From (4,6), if I go L to (3,6), I am moving away from (6,6).\n> \n> Perhaps I should go down to open space or something.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid.\n> \n> Grid size 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are inside, but x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0, x=7 walls, so min x=1, max x=6; y=0,y=7 walls, min y=1, max y=6.

Head direction is D, which is down, meaning it was moving down to (4,5) from (4,6)? Let's see the positions: snake is [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]. Since head is first, and direction is D, that means it moved down to (4,5). But (4,6) is above (4,5), so if it moved down to (4,5), previous head was at (4,6), and before that, it was at (5,6) or something. Positions are head to tail: (4,5) is head, (4,6) is first body, (5,6) is tail.

It's turn 10, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), and tail at (4,6). Since it's a list, [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)], so head is (4,4), body is (4,5), tail is (4,6). The head direction is D, which is down, meaning the snake is moving downward.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 10, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.

No negative food here.\n> \n> My goal is to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks, thinking 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing survival.\n> \n> Snake is moving down, at (4,4). Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse. So allowed moves are D, L, R. But I have to consider walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So it's vertical, head down at (4,4), tail up at (4,6).\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (2,1): near bottom-left, life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> - (6,6): bottom-right, life span 4, so can be eaten later.\n> \n> - (4,1): directly above the head? Head is at (4,4), so (4,1) is up, at y=1. Since y=0 is bottom? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is D (down), and positions are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), with head at (4,4) and tail at (4,6), and moving down, that means decreasing y? Let's see: if moving down, from (4,5) to (4,4), so y decreases when moving down? That might be counterintuitive.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,4), previous was (4,5), so from (4,5) to (4,4), y decreased from 5 to 4, so down is decreasing y. Similarly, tail is at (4,6), so y=6 is above.\n> \n> In standard Cartesian coordinates, y often increases upward, but in grid terms, it might be row-wise. Here, since moving down decreases y, it seems y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. If y decreases when moving down, then y=0 is the bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So, (4,4) is center? Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) bottom-left to (7,7) top-right? (0,0) bottom-left, x right, y up? But if moving down decreases y, then from (4,5) to (4,4) is down, so y=4 is below y=5, so y increases as we go up. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So head at (4,4), which is middle of grid, y=4.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,1): x=2, y=1, so bottom-left area, near y=0 bottom.\n> \n> - (6,6): x=6, y=6, top-right area.\n> \n> - (4,1): x=4, y=1, directly below head?

Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), etc., not (4,3), so (4,3) is free.\n> \n> (3,4): x=3,y=4, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): x=5,y=4, obstacles have (6,4), but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But (6,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) is adjacent but not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, also, after moving, the snake body moves, so tail moves forward.\n> \n> If I move to a cell, and it's food, I eat it and grow.\n> \n> But for food under body, need body to move away first.\n> \n> Here, no food under body now.\n> \n> Now, (2,1) is far, at (2,1), I'm at (4,4), so I need to go left and down.\n> \n> But to eat it this turn, I need to be adjacent and move to it.\n> \n> Currently, from (4,4), (2,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (4,3), (3,4), (5,4), (4,5) but (4,5) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,5) is the body segment, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is down, (3,4) left, (5,4) right.\n> \n> (2,1) is two left and three down, not reachable in one move. So I cannot eat (2,1) on this turn, no matter what I do. Since it's not adjacent, I can't move to it directly.

The planned path achieves this by Turn 13.  \n   - Other foods (e.g., (4,1), (4,2)) have longer lifespans and can be targeted later.  \n   - Moving Down would delay reaching (6,6) and risk missing it.\n\n**Final Decision**:  \n\\boxed{U}",

So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it just moved to (5,4) from the left, I assume from (4,4), but let's see the positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), then (4,5).

It's turn 13, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then body at (5,5), and tail at (5,4). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so last move was left to (4,5) from, say, (5,5), but positions are given as [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], so head at (4,5), which it moved to from (5,5) by going left. Current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. But the snake is on the grid, so internal cells are from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But food at (6,6), which might be a corner.\n> \n> x=7 and y=7 are walls, so (6,6) is not a wall, since walls are at x=7 and y=7, so (6,6) is playable. Similarly, (4,1) is playable since y=1 is not border unless y=0.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. 6 is included since (6,6) is given as food, so yes, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,5), body at (5,5), tail at (5,4). So the snake is currently at positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). From this, the head is at (4,5), which it entered by moving left from (5,5). Current direction is L.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints. Cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on the next turn because that would be instant reverse. So from current head (4,5), with direction L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down: to (4,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (3,5)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there because of collision, except for the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> Important: I can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but only if the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (4,6): is this valid? (4,6) - let's check if it's wall or obstacle or body.\n> \n> Walls: y=6 is not border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable. x=4, y=6. Obstacles: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), none at (4,6). Body: snake positions are (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), so (4,6) is empty. So up is possible.\n> \n> - Down to (4,4): similarly, (4,4) not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake has (5,4), which is different cell. (4,4) is empty, so down possible.\n> \n> - Left to (3,5): (3,5) not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so ok. Snake: not occupied, so left possible.\n> \n> - Right to (5,5): but (5,5) is currently occupied by the body segment. However, when I move, the snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if I move right to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After movement, that segment will move to where the head was, (4,5), and the tail will move to where the first body was, (5,5)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Body: (5,5)\n> \n> Tail: (5,4)\n> \n> If I move right to (5,5), which is the position of the body. But at the same time, the body will move to the head's old position (4,5), and tail to (5,5)? Conflict.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by the tail, and the tail is about to move, it might be ok if the tail moves away. But here, the tail is at (5,4), and if head moves to (5,5), which is body, not tail.\n> \n> (5,5) is the body, not the tail. Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) would cause head to collide with the body segment at (5,5), which doesn't move away instantly; it moves to (4,5) when head moves.\n> \n> So collision occurs because when head moves to (5,5), the body is still there for that instant, so it's a collision. Therefore, I cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail if it's moving.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,5) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) is invalid and causes collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (4,5) is not possible since it's current head.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), but not R to (5,5) because occupied by body.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because of instant reverse? Current direction is L, so moving R is opposite, so not allowed even if cell free, but here it's occupied anyway.\n> \n> So only U, D, L are possible from (4,5).\n> \n> Now, let's look at the food.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=13, so (6,6) has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 13 + (2-1) = turn 14? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically: if life span is L at turn t, after turn t, it decreases to L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains, else disappears.\n> \n> After turn t, if life span was L, it becomes L-1.\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, food has life span L, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1.

At start turn 13: L=4, can be eaten turn 13,14,15,16? Turn 16: at start, L=1, can be eaten, after turn 16, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> But life span decreases after each turn, including current.\n> \n> Standard: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span S. It can be eaten during turn t. After the turn, if not eaten, S decreases by 1. If S-1 == 0, it disappears; else, remains with S-1 for next turn.\n> \n> So for (6,6): S=2 at turn 13.

(3,5) has food with value 1.\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5), I eat the food there.

When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, meaning a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n> \n> Recall: when snake eats food, on that turn, head moves to food cell, and instead of the tail moving, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was going to move from, so the tail stays, and snake length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: normally, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of predecessor.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves one step: head to new position, each body segment to the previous position of the one ahead. If no eat, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> If eat, then after moving, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position doesn't change, effectively growing.\n> \n> But the movement happens first.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H, B, T.\n> \n> If move to new cell, not food: H' = new pos, B' = H, T' = B. So T moves away.\n> \n> If move to food: H' = food cell, B' = H, and since eat, T stays, so positions become H', B', T (with T not moving), so new segment is at T, but T is now part of body, and a new tail is added? No.\n> \n> After eating, the snake has an extra segment. So the positions: head at new food, body at old head, and tail remains at old tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For instance, current: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5), which has food. So after move: head at (3,5), body moves to (4,5) (old head), tail should move to (5,5) (old body), but since I eat, the tail does not move, so tail stays at (5,4), and a new segment is added? So positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), and tail (5,4) remains, but (5,4) was tail, now it's the last body, and a new tail is added at... I think I'm messing up.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, the snake moves as usual, but after the move, instead of removing the tail segment, it keeps it, so the tail position stays, and the new head position is added.\n> \n> So from [H, B, T], if eat at new head position: new positions [H_new, H, B] and T stays, so [H_new, H, B, T]? But B was the body, now it's behind new head.\n> \n> Better to think: positions list: before move: [P0=head, P1, P2=tail]\n> \n> After move without eat: head to new Q, then P1 to P0, P2 to P1, so [Q, P0, P1]\n> \n> After move with eat: head to Q, P1 to P0, and P2 stays, so [Q, P0, P1, P2] with P2 now the tail.\n> \n> In this case, before: head (4,5), P1 (5,5), tail (5,4)\n> \n> Move to (3,5): if eat, then new positions: head (3,5), then body (4,5) (old head), body (5,5) (old P1), and tail (5,4) stays, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] with (5,4) as tail.\n> \n> But (5,5) was body, now it's still body, and (5,4) is tail.\n> \n> Yes, so snake grows to 4 segments.\n> \n> If not eat, move to (3,5) no food: then head (3,5), body (4,5), tail (5,5), and (5,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Back to turn 13.\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5), I eat the food there, snake grows to length 4.\n> \n> But is it safe?

Positions are given as [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], so head is first, so at turn 14, head is at (3,5), which means it moved to (3,5) from previous position. Since direction is L, it was moving left, so previous head position was (4,5), and it moved to (3,5), so the body segments follow: (4,5) is now the first body segment, (5,5) second, (5,4) tail.\n> \n> Now, for movement, I can go up, down, left, or right, but cannot instantly reverse. Since current direction is L, I cannot go right immediately, because that would be opposite. So possible moves from (3,5): up to (3,6), down to (3,4), left to (2,5), or right? But right is opposite to left, so I cannot go right. Direction constraint: no instant reverse, meaning if moving left, cannot go right on next turn.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible actions: U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), L (left to (2,5)), but not R.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food and plan 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, food at (6,6) has life span 1, so it must be eaten this turn or it disappears. But (6,6) is far from (3,5). Current head at (3,5), to reach (6,6), I need to go right and up, but (3,5) to (6,6) is 3 steps right and 1 up, but since I can only move one per turn, minimum 4 moves? Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4 cells away, so I can reach it in 4 turns, but life span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, so only available on turn 14. If I don't eat it on turn 14, it's gone. But to eat it, I need to be at (6,6) on turn 14, but I'm at (3,5), so I can't reach it this turn. Therefore, I cannot eat (6,6); it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Life span 1 on turn 14: it exists on turn 14 and will disappear after turn 14, meaning not available on turn 15. So to eat it, I must move to (6,6) on turn 14. But from (3,5), I can't reach (6,6) in one move; it's too far. So impossible to eat (6,6). So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Next food: (4,1) with value 1, life span 3. So available on turns 14, 15, 16. Disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> Another food: (4,2) with value 1, life span 6, available turns 14 to 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5). I need to plan a sequence of moves to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position (3,5):\n> \n> - U to (3,6): is (3,6) safe? y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall, I think. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are safe, except obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6): x=3, y=6. Since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall, so it should be accessible. Internal obstacles: none at (3,6), so safe.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake body: positions are (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), so (3,6) is empty.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is fine.\n> \n> - D to (3,4): similarly, (3,4) should be safe. No obstacles, not snake body.\n> \n> - L to (2,5): (2,5), let's check. x=2,y=5. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is different. (2,4) is obstacle, (2,5) should be free unless snake. Snake at (3,5),(4,5),etc, not (2,5). So safe.\n> \n> - R not possible due to direction.\n> \n> Now, also, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food, else not.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,1) and (4,2), which are close to each other.\n> \n> (4,1) and (4,2) are both at x=4, y=1 and y=2.\n> \n> But (5,1) is an obstacle, so (4,1) might be accessible, but (4,1) is a food position, so it should be free unless occupied, but food is there, so it's free to move to, I think. Food can be eaten when head moves to it.\n> \n> But (5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) is adjacent to obstacle, but that's fine.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), to reach (4,1) or (4,2).\n> \n> (4,1) is at (4,1), head at (3,5), distance |4-3| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps away.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is |4-3| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps away.\n> \n> But (4,1) has life span 3, so I have until turn 16 to eat it. Turn 14,15,16.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has life span 6, more time.\n> \n> But I need to consider the path and risks.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (5,4), which will move when the snake moves, since if not eating, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Snake movement: when I move, if I don't eat, the tail moves, so the body follows.\n> \n> If I eat, tail stays, and I grow.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the board state.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n> \n> Snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), tail (5,4)\n> \n> Food: (6,6) - but will disappear, so ignore.\n> \n> (4,1) and (4,2)\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - D to (3,4)\n> \n> - L to (2,5)\n> \n> Not R.\n> \n> I need to choose a move that leads to a path to food or safe area.\n> \n> Since (4,1) and (4,2) are south, going down might be good.\n> \n> But let's see what happens if I go down to (3,4).\n> \n> Turn 14: move D to (3,4)\n> \n> Then snake positions: head to (3,4), then body segments: the previous head position (3,5) becomes new body, so positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] and tail (5,4) is removed? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Initial positions: at turn 14, positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: tail (5,4)\n> \n> After move D to (3,4): new head at (3,4). Then body: segment 1 moves to previous head position (3,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (4,5), tail segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (5,5). Since no eating, tail is removed, so the cell (5,4) is now free.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Tail is now (5,5)? Positions: [ (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] so tail at (5,5).\n> \n> (5,4) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go U to (3,6): head (3,6), body [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] tail (5,5)? [ (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5).\n> \n> If L to (2,5): head (2,5), body [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] and tail (5,4) removed, so [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5).\n> \n> (5,4) free.\n> \n> Now, after turn 14, food (6,6) disappears.\n> \n> Food (4,1) and (4,2) remain.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan to eat one of them.\n> \n> But (4,1) has shorter life, so maybe prioritize that.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> Another thing: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (5,4), and head at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) and (5,4) are not adjacent; |dx|=2, |dy|=1, not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, let's consider paths to food.\n> \n> First, to (4,1): from (3,5), one way is to go down multiple times, but I need to avoid obstacles.\n> \n> For example, from (3,5), if I go D to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can go D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then L or R? But (4,1) is at x=4,y=1.\n> \n> From (3,2), to (4,1), I can go R to (4,2) then D to (4,1), or directly? (3,2) to (4,1) is diagonal, not possible; must move orthogonal.\n> \n> So from (3,2), to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) or (3,1) first, but (3,1) might be ok, or (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) has food, but I might eat it earlier.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is at y=1, which is above y=0 wall, but y=1 is safe.\n> \n> But there is obstacle at (5,1), so (4,1) is accessible, but I need to approach it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is at (4,2), which might be easier to reach.\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,1) disappears after turn 16, so I have 3 turns to eat it: turn 14,15,16.\n> \n> Turn 14 is current, so if I eat on turn 14,15, or 16.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has more time.\n> \n> But since both are positive, I should eat both if possible.\n> \n> But I need to sequence moves.\n> \n> Also, the grid has limited space, and obstacles.\n> \n> Let me list all safe cells.\n> \n> Safe cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 except obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n> \n> So for example, row y=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle. (5,1) and (6,1) are obstacles, so (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is safe, but surrounded? Left is (3,1), right is (5,1) obstacle, down is not, but y=1 is bottom, so up to (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, y=2: (1,2) obstacle, (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) — (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,2) not accessible.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=2: x=1: (1,2) obstacle, x=2: (2,2) safe, x=3: (3,2) safe, x=4: (4,2) food, x=5: (5,2) safe, x=6: (6,2) safe? (6,2) is not listed obstacle, so safe.\n> \n> Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (6,2) is not obstacle, so safe.\n> \n> y=3: all x=1 to6 safe except no obstacles listed, so all safe.\n> \n> y=4: (1,4), (2,4) obstacle, so (2,4) blocked, (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) obstacle.

Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), then body segments at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is Down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (3,5) to (3,4)? Let's list the positions: positions are [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. Head is first, so head is at (3,4), and it's moving Down. But moving Down would increase y? No, in grid coordinates, typically y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So U increases y, meaning y is up, I assume. So if head is at (3,4) and direction is D, that means it just moved down to (3,4), so previous head was at (3,5), and it moved down to (3,4). Positions: index 0 is head (3,4), then (3,5) is the neck, I think? Let's see the sequence: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].\n> \n> If head is at (3,4) and it moved Down, that means it was at (3,5) before and moved down to (3,4). So the body segments are: (3,5) is the first body segment, which was the head one turn ago, then (4,5), then (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 5, value 1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,1), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,1), life_span=3 on turn 15. That means on turn 15, life_span is 3; after turn 15, it decreases to 2; after turn 16, to 1; after turn 17, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turns 15,16,17.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life_span=5, so it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 15:5, 16:4, 17:3, 18:2, 19:1, gone after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns:\n> \n> - On turn t when food appears, life_span = N\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When life_span reaches 0, it disappears, meaning it can't be eaten on that turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> For (4,1), life_span=3 on turn 15. So:\n> \n> - Turn 15: life_span=3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 16: life_span=2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span=1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 17, life_span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 18.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2): life_span=5\n> \n> - Turn 15:5, 16:4, 17:3, 18:2, 19:1, 20:0 gone.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), moving Down.

Snake positions: head at (3,3), body at (3,4) and (3,5), which are above if y increases up, or below? Positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). If y=0 is bottom, then (3,5) is higher y, so north. Similarly, tail at (4,5). Head direction D (down), so decreasing y if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 is top or bottom. But to avoid confusion, let's define: assume (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right, so y increases up. Then moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5). So from head to tail: (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (4,5). Head at (3,3), which has lower y than (3,4), so it was moving down to (3,3). Yes.\n> \n> Current direction D, so from previous position (3,4) to (3,3), down.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,1): x=4,y=1, life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (4,2): x=4,y=2, life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (5,6): x=5,y=6, life span 10, value 1\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3)\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4) but (3,4) is occupied by the body. Body segments: (3,4) is the first body segment, so if snake moves up to (3,4), it would collide with its own body immediately? But according to rules, moving into a body segment is deadly, except for the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, tail is at (4,5). From (3,3), moving to (3,4) would be into a body segment that is not tail, so collision. Similarly, (3,5) is also body.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: (3,4) - occupied by body, not tail, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: (3,2) - possible, but need to check if within bounds and not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3, y=2. Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are borders, so y=2 is not wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) - (3,2) not in list, so free.\n> \n> - L: (2,3) - x=2,y=3. Not wall, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) - (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different, so free.\n> \n> - R: (4,3) - x=4,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle, free.\n> \n> But head direction is D, so if I move L or R, it's not reverse, since reverse would be U (opposite of D).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction D, so opposite is U, which is invalid anyway. So can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> But U is invalid because of body.\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (3,2), L to (2,3), or R to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all cells for reference.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> Food: (4,1), (4,2), (5,6)\n> \n> Life span: (4,1) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so at turn 16, life=2, so after turn 16, it will have life=1, then after turn 17, life=0, gone. Similarly, (4,2) life=4, so disappears after turn 19 (since turn 16:4, 17:3, 18:2, 19:1, 20:0 gone? Let's clarify life span countdown.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will be there for L turns, including turn t. After turn t+L-1, it disappears? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, at which point it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases on each turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span L: present\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1: life span 1\n> \n> - Then after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, (4,1) at turn 16, life span 2: present on turn 16 and 17, disappears after turn 17, so not on turn 18.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 4: present on turns 16,17,18,19, disappears after 19.\n> \n> (5,6) life span 10: present for many turns.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, but I have to output a sequence starting from turn 16.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead and choose a path that might lead to food or safe areas.\n> \n> Also, consider the tail: since tail will move, and if I eat food, snake grows, so tail stays or new segment.\n> \n> When snake eats food, if positive, length increases by one, so tail doesn't move away immediately; new segment is added where food was, so the previous tail remains until next move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> And \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,5), head at (3,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means next cell, so (3,3) to (4,5) is not adjacent; they are diagonal or something? Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells are those differing by 1 in x or y, not both.\n> \n> So head (3,3) and tail (4,5) are not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so not sharing a side.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate possible moves from (3,3).\n> \n> Option 1: Move Down to (3,2)\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: back to (3,3), but (3,3) will be body after move, since head moves to (3,2), so (3,3) becomes the new head position? After moving to (3,2), the snake positions will be: head (3,2), then body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5). Tail is still at (4,5), but when snake moves, tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, when head moves to new cell, tail leaves its position, so the snake shifts.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: each turn, head moves to a new cell, and if no food eaten, tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 16, if I move to (3,2), is there food? (3,2) is not a food position; food is at (4,1), (4,2), (5,6). So no food at (3,2), so after moving, head to (3,2), body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? Positions update: new head is (3,2), then the first body segment is the previous head position (3,3), then (3,4), then (3,5), and tail (4,5). But (4,5) is the tail; when no food, the tail should move to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake positions: at start, S = [H, B1, B2, T] = [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say P.\n> \n> If P has food, eat it, then new snake: [P, H, B1, B2, T] but T stays, so length increases.\n> \n> If no food, then [P, H, B1, B2] and T is removed, so the new tail is B2.\n> \n> In this case, positions: H to (3,2), no food, so new positions: head (3,2), then body: previous H (3,3), then B1 (3,4), then B2 (3,5), and the tail (4,5) is removed, so B2 (3,5) is now tail.\n> \n> Snake segments: index 0: head, 1: body after head, 2: next, 3: tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell P:\n> \n> - If no food eaten: new head P, then segment 0 becomes body at its position, segment 1 becomes next, segment 2 becomes tail, and segment 3 (tail) is removed. So new snake: [P, seg0, seg1, seg2]\n> \n> Here seg0 is (3,3), seg1 is (3,4), seg2 is (3,5), seg3 is (4,5).\n> \n> After move to (3,2) no food: new head (3,2), then seg0 becomes body at (3,3), then seg1 at (3,4), then seg2 at (3,5) is now tail, and seg3 removed.\n> \n> So snake becomes: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (2,3), same thing, no food there, so new snake: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> (3,5) was seg2, now tail.\n> \n> Similarly for right to (4,3).\n> \n> Now back to options.\n> \n> From (3,3), move D to (3,2)\n> \n> Then from (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) - but (3,3) is now body, and not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) - y=1, not wall, obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), (1,2) etc, (3,1) not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) - free, not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> - R: to (4,2) - (4,2) has food!

So moving down means increasing y? Coordinates: let's assume (x,y) with y increasing up or down?\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Head at (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since head direction is down, and it's moving to (3,2) from previous position? Snake positions are given as list: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)], with head first. So head is (3,2), and the next segment is (3,3), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, then (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Inconsistency.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. But from positions, head at (3,2), next at (3,3). If y increases as we go up, then (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but direction is down? That can't be.\n> \n> Perhaps y increases as we go down? Like in computer graphics, top-left is (0,0), y down.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 and y=7, with y=0 top or bottom?\n> \n> Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). But in terms of grid, if y=0 is top, then U (y+1) would be down if y increases down, but usually U is up.\n> \n> Standard: in grid, often y=0 is top, U moves to lower y or higher y?\n> \n> The movement definitions:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — so if y+1, that could be up or down depending on coordinate system.\n> \n> But with walls at y=0 and y=7, and positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — all increasing y.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), direction D. If direction is down, and previous move was down, but from where?\n> \n> The positions show head at (3,2), then body at (3,3), so the snake was previously at (3,1) or something, but it's not given. Head direction is the current moving direction.\n> \n> At turn 17, head is at (3,2), and it is moving down, so from turn 16 to 17, it moved to (3,2) from, say, (3,1) if down is decreasing y or increasing.\n> \n> Assume that y=0 is the top wall, y=7 is the bottom wall. So U (y+1) moves down? No.\n> \n> If y=0 is top, and y increases downward, then:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — y+1 means higher y, which is downward, so U would be down? But U is up, usually.\n> \n> I think there's confusion.\n> \n> Look at the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1)\n> \n> But in grid coordinates, if we consider (x,y) with y=0 at top, then:\n> \n> - U: (x, y-1) typically for up, but here U is (x,y+1), so that suggests y=0 is bottom, y increasing upward.\n> \n> Then, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row? But that might be unusual.\n> \n> Let's see snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Head at (3,2), direction down.\n> \n> If direction down, and positions from (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), which are increasing y, so if y increases upward, then from (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but direction is down, contradiction.\n> \n> Therefore, it must be that y increases downward.\n> \n> So: y=0 is top row, y=7 is bottom row.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) — y+1 means lower down, so downward, but U is supposed to be up? No.\n> \n> U is defined as (x,y+1), and if y=0 top, y+1 is down, so U would be moving down, but U is labeled \"U\" for up, that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it.\n> \n> In the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1)\n> \n> But in terms of direction, if the grid has y=0 at top, then:\n> \n> - Moving U: (x,y+1) would increase y, which moves down the grid (since y=0 top, y=1 below, etc.)\n> \n> But U is called \"U\" for up, which is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at bottom.\n> \n> Let's assume that, because otherwise it's inconsistent.\n> \n> Assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) — y+1, higher y, which is up.\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) — y-1, lower y, down.\n> \n> Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Then snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — all increasing y, so from (3,2) to (3,3) is moving up, but head direction is D, down? Contradiction.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), direction down, so it should be moving to lower y.\n> \n> But (3,2) to next body (3,3) is higher y, so the body is behind, so the snake was moving up to reach (3,2) from (3,1) or something.\n> \n> At turn 17, head is at (3,2), and it is moving down, meaning that on the next move, it will go to (3,1) or (3,3) depending on direction.\n> \n> Direction is the current moving direction, so from previous position to current.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> The snake positions are given for current turn: head at (3,2), then segments at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the head was at some position at turn 16, and moved to (3,2) at turn 17.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so from turn 16 to turn 17, it moved down to (3,2).\n> \n> If down is decreasing y, then from (3,3) to (3,2), for example.\n> \n> But the positions show (3,2) head, then (3,3), so at turn 17, head is at (3,2), and the first body segment is at (3,3), which means that on turn 16, head was at (3,3), and it moved down to (3,2) on turn 17, so (3,3) is now the neck, and so on.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> So, with y increasing upward: y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) - up\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) - down\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) - left\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) - right\n> \n> Walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,2), moving down (so just moved to (3,2) from (3,3)? From above, at turn 17, head at (3,2), which was moved to from previous head position. Since body is at (3,3), that means previous head was at (3,3) on turn 16, moved down to (3,2) on turn 17.\n> \n> Direction is the direction it moved to get to current position, so for turn 17, head at (3,2), direction D, meaning it came from above, so it was at (3,3) and moved down to (3,2).\n> \n> For the next move, from (3,2), it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse, so since it just moved down, it cannot move up (U) next, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so next turn, it cannot move U (up), because that would be reverse.\n> \n> It can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,1): x=4, y=1, value 1, life span 1, so must be eaten on turn 17 or it's gone.\n> \n> - (4,2): x=4, y=2, value 1, life span 3, exists until turn 19.\n> \n> - (5,6): x=5, y=6, value 1, life span 9, exists for many turns.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,2).

Is it free? Let's see: not a wall, not occupied by snake? Snake is at (3,2),(3,3),etc., not (3,1). Internal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), not (3,1). So (3,1) is empty, I think. But is there food? Food at (4,1), (4,2), (5,6), not at (3,1). So (3,1) is free cell.\n> \n> - L (left): (2,2) - x=2,y=2. Not wall, not snake? Snake at x=3, y=2 to 5. Internal obstacles: (1,2) and (2,4), not (2,2).

Adjacent cells are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). (4,1) is diagonal or what? (4,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); adjacent means sharing edge, so (3,2) adjacent to (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). (4,1) is at distance 2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So to eat (4,1), we need to be at (4,1) with head, but currently head is at (3,2), so we can't eat it directly this turn unless we move to it, but it's not possible in one move.\n> \n> To eat (4,1) on turn 17, the head must be at (4,1) on turn 17. But head is at (3,2), so it can't be at (4,1) this turn. Therefore, it's impossible to eat (4,1) on turn 17 because we can't reach it from current position in one move. The only way to eat food is when the head moves onto the food cell.\n> \n> Since (4,1) is not adjacent to current head, we can't move to it this turn.

So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (5,3) from (4,3), I think. Let's list the positions in order: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So from head to tail: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items.

So it will disappear after 6 turns, including this one, so it has 5 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N-1 turns? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns? No. It says: \"disappears after N turns\" and N is the life span given. For example, food at (5,6) has life span 6. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 21, life span is 6, so after turn 21, it will have 5 left, and so on, until turn 26 it disappears (after 6 turns from now?

So it is present for N turns starting from the turn it's reported.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (5,6): life span 6 at turn 21. So it will be present on turns 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

Since countdown decreases every turn including current, after this turn (turn 21), life span becomes 5, and so on. It disappears when life span reaches 0, which would be after 6 decreases, so on turn 27 it would be gone? But turns start from 21.\n> \n> - Turn 21: life span 6, present\n> \n> - After turn 21 (before turn 22), life span decreases to 5\n> \n> - Turn 22: life span 5, present\n> \n> - ...\n> - Turn 26: life span 1, present\n> - After turn 26, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not present on turn 27.\n> \n> So it is present from turn 21 to turn 26 inclusive, that's 6 turns.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food: (1,5) with value 1, life span 8, so present from turn 21 to 28 inclusive.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,4), moving Up.

This keeps the snake in a more open area, allowing future moves towards other foods while avoiding immediate constraints.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 22 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (5, 6, 5, 1)\n\t- (1, 5, 7, 1)\n\t- (6, 2, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 22 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 22, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, I assume, since x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), then body segments at (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to (5,5) from (5,4), I suppose. Since it's moving Up, from (5,4) to (5,5), so at turn 22, head is at (5,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 5, value +1 (since it says value1=1, I assume positive food)\n> \n> The format is (x,y, life_span, value). For (5,6,5,1), so position (5,6), life span 5 turns, value +1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5,7,1) : position (1,5), life span 7, value +1\n> \n> (6,2,10,1) : position (6,2), life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food here is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 22, for (5,6) it has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n> \n> At turn 22, food at (5,6) has life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 22 to turn 26 (since 22 to 26 is 5 turns: 22,23,24,25,26? Let's calculate: if life span is N, it lasts for N turns. At turn t, it has life span L, meaning it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for L more turns, including current.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L: it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at t+L. So for (5,6) at turn 22, life span 5, it can be eaten on turns 22,23,24,25,26? Turns: 22,23,24,25,26 is 5 turns, but since it disappears after N turns, if N=5, after 5 turns from now, at turn 27 it would be gone, so it exists from turn 22 to 26 inclusive? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food is spawned with life span N. Then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span N, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1, can be eaten if N-1 >0\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t+k: life span N-k, can be eaten if N-k >0\n> \n> - Until turn t+N-1: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn t+N: life span 0, disappears, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (5,6) at turn 22 with life span 5: it can be eaten on turns 22,23,24,25,26. After turn 26, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 22 to 28 (22+7-1=28)\n> \n> (6,2) life span 10: can be eaten from turn 22 to 31 (22+10-1=31)\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,5), direction Up. So from (5,4) to (5,5) Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: current direction is Up, so I cannot move Down immediately, because Down is opposite of Up.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 22: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Moving Up would go to (5,6), which has food! (5,6) has food with value +1.\n> \n> If I move Up to (5,6), I eat the food, since head moves to a cell with food.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, what is the grid state.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so I cannot move to those cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). Tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Now, moving Up to (5,6): is (5,6) valid? y=6, which is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 walls, so playable area: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> (5,6) is on the top row, y=6, which is adjacent to y=7 wall, but (5,6) itself is not a wall, since walls are only at y=7, not y=6. Similarly, x=6 is playable, x=7 is wall.\n> \n> So (5,6) is a valid cell, and it has food.\n> \n> If I move to (5,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (5,6), and body includes the previous head, so positions become: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,2) but since we eat, a new segment is added, so snake length increases by one. After eating, the tail doesn't move on that turn? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of positions, when head moves to food, the body follows, but since we add a segment, the tail stays in place for that move? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when head moves to a cell with food, the head occupies that cell, and the body moves forward, but since we eat, we add a new segment at the end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new tail is created from the previous position.\n> \n> But in terms of the list: suppose current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head at new position, then [new head, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard: each turn, snake moves one step in direction. If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed from the grid.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, body moves as usual, but the tail is not removed; instead, we keep the tail, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In position list:\n> \n> - Without eating: new positions [new_head, head, body1, ..., bodyn-1]  (since tail is lost)\n> \n> Let’s say positions are [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell N:\n> \n> - If no food at N: new positions [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}]  so tail Pk is removed.\n> \n> - If food at N: new positions [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]  so tail Pk remains, and snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, when food is eaten, the tail cell is not vacated; it stays occupied.\n> \n> But in this problem, there's a special case about food under body.\n> \n> Here, (5,6) has food, and it's not under snake, I think. Snake is at (5,5), (5,4), etc., not at (5,6), so moving to (5,6) should eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the new head and new tail would collide? Let's see.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), head at (5,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,5) and (4,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonally apart or something? (5,5) to (4,2) is dx=1, dy=3, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (x±1,y) or (x,y±1).\n> \n> So (5,5) adjacent cells: (5,6) U, (5,4) D, (4,5) L, (6,5) R.\n> \n> Tail at (4,2), which is not adjacent to head.

It's turn 23, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls and internal obstacles. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are there, I can't go to those cells. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).

Deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 23, moving R is invalid because it causes body collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite direction, but R is not opposite, opposite would be R if current is L, but R is not possible anyway due to body.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R, but R is also blocked by body, so only possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - U to (4,6): is this cell free? Walls: y=6 is not wall? y=6 is within 1-6, and border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall. Internal obstacles? (4,6) not listed, so free. Snake positions? Snake has (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), so (4,6) not occupied. So U is possible.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): similarly, (4,4) not wall, not obstacle, not snake. Snake has (4,5), (5,5), etc., not (4,4). So free, possible.\n> \n> - L to (3,5): (3,5) not wall, not obstacle, not snake. Possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food and planning ahead.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) is close, life span 4, so I can reach it soon.\n> \n> From (4,5), to reach (5,6), I need to go right or up, but right is blocked, so only way is to go up to (4,6), then next move to (5,6)? From (4,6) to (5,6) is right.\n> \n> But if I go to (4,6) now, turn 23, then on turn 24 I can go R to (5,6) to eat the food.\n> \n> Is that safe?\n> \n> First, if I eat (5,6), value +1, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, snake will have 6 segments.\n> \n> But let's simulate.\n> \n> Current turn 23, snake: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> If I move U to (4,6), then new head is (4,6), tail moves? When moving, if not eating, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (4,6), body follows: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when you move, the head goes to the new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail segment is removed unless you eat food.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 23, if I move U to (4,6), and (4,6) has no food, so no eat, then new positions: head at (4,6), then the body: the first body segment was at (5,5), but now it should move to where head was, (4,5)? Let's see sequence.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [head: (4,5), seg1: (5,5), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (5,3), tail: (4,3)]\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (4,6)\n> \n> Then seg1 moves to previous head position (4,5)\n> \n> seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (5,5)\n> \n> seg3 moves to previous seg2 position (5,4)\n> \n> tail moves to previous seg3 position (5,3)? Tail was at (4,3), which is seg3? Positions: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: (5,5), index 2: (5,4), index 3: (5,3), index 4: tail (4,3)\n> \n> After head moves to (4,6), then index 1 (body) moves to index 0's old position (4,5)\n> \n> index 2 moves to index 1's old position (5,5)\n> \n> index 3 moves to index 2's old position (5,4)\n> \n> index 4 (tail) moves to index 3's old position (5,3)\n> \n> But index 3 was (5,3), old position is (5,3), but it moves to where index 3 was? Confusion.\n> \n> Standard: each segment except head moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after head moves to (4,6):\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 1 (5,5) moves to where index 0 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 2 (5,4) moves to where index 1 was, (5,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 3 (5,3) moves to where index 2 was, (5,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 4 (tail, (4,3)) moves to where index 3 was, (5,3)\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail at (5,3)\n> \n> But (4,3) is now empty.\n> \n> Now, tail was at (4,3), moved to (5,3), so (4,3) vacated.\n> \n> Now, for turn 24, if I move R to (5,6), but (5,6) is where food is.\n> \n> If I move to (5,6), and it has food, I eat it.\n> \n> So new head at (5,6), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Before move, positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) ] with head at (4,6)\n> \n> After move R to (5,6), which has food, so head moves to (5,6), and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the previous tail position (5,3) gets a new segment, so snake becomes: head (5,6), then body: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and new tail at (5,3)\n> \n> So positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> Now, is there any danger?\n> \n> After eating, the head is at (5,6), and body includes (4,6), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> Now, what about the tail reward danger? The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, when I eat at (5,6), the tail is at (5,3), not adjacent. Head (5,6) and tail (5,3) are not adjacent; they are 3 cells apart. So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, (5,6) is not under the body; it's free.\n> \n> But let's check if it's safe to move to (5,6) from (4,6). (5,6) is not occupied by body now; before turn 24 move, body has (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), so (5,6) is free, so moving R to (5,6) is safe.\n> \n> Then I eat the food, grow to length 6.\n> \n> Now, life span: (5,6) has life span 4, present until turn 26.

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at those borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. That means the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but the playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Yes.\n> \n> Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body segments at (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,6) from previous position. Since the head is at (4,6) and direction is R, that means it came from left, so previous head was at (3,6), but (3,6) is now the second segment. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,5)\n> \n> And head direction is R, so it moved right to (4,6) from (3,6).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,6), life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 26, life span is 1, so after turn 26, it will be gone if not eaten. Since we're at turn 26, and we make a move for turn 26, if we eat it now, we get it; otherwise, after this turn, it vanishes.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns from now, i.e., after turn 28 or at turn 29? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span N, it will be there for N turns, including turn t. After N turns, it disappears.\n> \n> For (5,6) at turn 26, life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Meaning, if not eaten on turn 26, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,5), life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 26, life span 3. After turn 26, life span becomes 2. After turn 27, life span 1. After turn 28, life span 0, so it disappears after turn 28, meaning not available on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 6, so disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 9, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So from turn 26 to at least turn 31.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,6)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But head direction is R, so I can't move L (opposite direction) instantly. So no left move.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls at borders, and these specific cells.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body, segment 3. But can I move there? The tail is at (5,5), which will move away when the snake moves.\n> \n> Important: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells that were occupied might become free.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, as long as it's only the tail and not other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, the snake body segments: positions are (4,6) head, (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves away, so the new position should not be any body segment except possibly the tail if it's moving.\n> \n> Specifically, if I move to a cell that is currently the tail, and the tail moves, it should be ok, as long as no other body part is there.\n> \n> In this position, (4,5) is segment 3, not tail. Tail is (5,5).\n> \n> Let's list current occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - (4,6): head\n> \n> - (3,6): body\n> \n> - (3,5): body\n> \n> - (4,5): body\n> \n> - (5,5): tail\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (4,5), (4,5) is currently occupied by a body segment, and it's not the tail. The tail is at (5,5), so moving to (4,5) would cause collision because (4,5) is a body segment that won't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head moves.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift, so the tail cell is vacated, but other body cells are still occupied by the next segments.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head to a new position, say (5,6), then the new positions become:\n> \n> - Head: new position\n> \n> - Segment 1: previous head position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous segment 1 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous segment 2 position (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous segment 3 position (4,5)\n> \n> - Tail is gone? No, the snake grows only when eating food. Currently, no food eaten, so length remains the same.\n> \n> If no food eaten, when head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,6), which is food, but let's see.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - currently occupied by segment 3, which is not the tail. After move, this cell will be occupied by segment 4? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> After a move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - The tail position is vacated\n> \n> So, for down move to (4,5):\n> \n> Current: head at (4,6), segments: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> After move down to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - But (4,5) was occupied by a body segment. Now, after move, the body segments become:\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,6)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,6)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,5)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,5)  // previous seg3? No.\n> \n> Previous positions:\n> \n> - Head was at (4,6)\n> \n> - Seg1 at (3,6)\n> \n> - Seg2 at (3,5)\n> \n> - Seg3 at (4,5)\n> \n> - Tail at (5,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head position (4,6)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (3,6)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (3,5)\n> \n> - New tail: old seg3 position (4,5)? But (4,5) is now the head, so the tail is old seg3 position? Let's index.\n> \n> The body segments follow the head. When head moves to a new cell, the first body segment goes to the old head position, second to old first position, and so on, and the last segment (tail) is removed if no growth.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten in this move, the tail is removed, so the new snake has the same length.\n> \n> So after moving down to (4,5):\n> \n> - New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Seg1: (4,6)  // old head\n> \n> - Seg2: (3,6)  // old seg1\n> \n> - Seg3: (3,5)  // old seg2\n> \n> - Tail: old seg3 was (4,5), but (4,5) is now head, so the tail should be old seg3? No.\n> \n> Old seg3 is at (4,5), but we're moving head to (4,5), so (4,5) is now head, and the body segments are shifted.\n> \n> The new body starts from old head position.\n> \n> So new snake:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Body: (4,6)  // where head was\n> \n> - Body: (3,6)  // where seg1 was\n> \n> - Body: (3,5)  // where seg2 was\n> \n> - Tail: where seg3 was, but seg3 was at (4,5), which is now head, so the tail position is vacated, and since no growth, we don't have a segment for old seg3 position; instead, the last body segment is at (3,5), and old tail at (5,5) is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated, and all segments shift forward.\n> \n> In this case, from positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: tail (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head at (4,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1 at old head (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 2 at old seg1 (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 3 at old seg2 (3,5)\n> \n> - Since no growth, we lose the tail, so no segment at old seg3 (4,5) or old tail? Old seg3 was at (4,5), which is now head, so the position (4,5) is occupied by head, and the body segments are from old head and old seg1, old seg2. Old seg2 was (3,5), so new segment 3 at (3,5), and old tail at (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> But (4,5) was occupied by seg3, which is now the head position. So when I move to (4,5), it was a body segment, but after the move, it becomes the head, so it's not a collision because the body segment is no longer there; it's replaced by the head.\n> \n> The rule is: collision if head touches any body segment after the move.\n> \n> After moving to (4,5), the new positions are:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Seg1: (4,6)\n> \n> - Seg2: (3,6)\n> \n> - Seg3: (3,5)\n> \n> - No tail at (5,5) anymore; it's free.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) was previously a body segment, but now it's the head, so no issue. The body segments are (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), none of which are at (4,5), so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for any move, if I move to a cell that was the tail, it's safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> If I move to a cell that was a body segment but not tail, it might be a problem only if that segment doesn't move, but since all segments shift, the cell is vacated only if it was the tail; otherwise, it becomes occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> In this case, for down move to (4,5):\n> \n> Before move, (4,5) is occupied by seg3.\n> \n> After move, (4,5) is head, so it's free for head to occupy, and the body is elsewhere.\n> \n> The key point is whether the cell I move to is occupied by a body segment that will not be vacated.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is occupied by seg3, which will not be there after move; instead, the head will be there, and seg3 moves to old seg2 position, etc.\n> \n> So it should be safe to move to (4,5) because after the move, (4,5) is head, and the body is at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), so (4,5) is not occupied by body; only head is there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (5,5), which is tail, after move, (5,5) is vacated, so head can be there.\n> \n> But in this case, moving down to (4,5) should be possible.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Let's list all possible moves from (4,6) with direction R.\n> \n> Cannot move left (opposite of R), so no L.\n> \n> Possible: U, D, R.\n> \n> U: (4,7) - y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (4,5) - is it free?

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 27 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 5, 2, 1)\n\t- (6, 2, 5, 1)\n\t- (3, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 27 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 27.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is R, which is right, so last move was to the right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 27, it will disappear after turn 28? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 27, life span is 2, so after turn 27, it becomes 1, and after turn 28, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,5): life span 2 at turn 27. After turn 27, life span becomes 1; after turn 28, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it exists on turns 27 and 28, can be eaten on those turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) with value 1, life span 5. So it will last until turn 31 (27+5-1? Let's see: at turn 27, life span 5; after t27, 4; t28,3; t29,2; t30,1; t31,0 gone. So exists turns 27 to 31.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns from now. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N more turns, so if N=2 at turn 27, it disappears after turn 28, so last chance to eat is turn 28.\n> \n> The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for N=2 at turn t, after t, N=1; after t+1, N=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) value 1, life span 8, so lasts until turn 34 (27+8-1=34?

So exists turns 27 to 34.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Current turn 27.\n> \n> First, where is the snake: head at (5,6), direction R (right). So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L (opposite, which would be left, but L is left, which is opposite of R, so cannot move L instantly. But I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Current head position (5,6). Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) – but (5,5) is occupied by the tail? Snake positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (5,5) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Now, moving to (5,5): is this safe? Normally, moving to tail is okay because when I move, the tail will move away. But I need to check if it's the tail and if food is there or something.\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is the tail, and there might be food, but in this case, no food is listed at (5,5), so it should be safe to move to tail position because after move, head goes to (5,5), and tail moves from (5,5) to the next, so no collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So yes, it's safe, as long as no other body part is there.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is only the tail, so moving to (5,5) should be fine.\n> \n> Left: (4,6) – but (4,6) is the body segment, second in the list. So if I move left to (4,6), that's a body collision, because it's not the tail? Positions: head (5,6), then (4,6) is the next segment, so if I move left to (4,6), it's occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it will still be there after move, so collision.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is safe to move into because it moves away.\n> \n> So left to (4,6) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Right: (6,6) – x=6,y=6. Is this within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (6,6) should be empty? But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,6) is not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,6) not in this list, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). No (6,6), so free.\n> \n> Down: (5,5) – as said, tail position, should be safe.\n> \n> Up: (5,7) – y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6): R to (6,6), D to (5,5), or U invalid, L invalid.\n> \n> L to (4,6) is body, invalid. U to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only two choices: R or D.\n> \n> Now, D to (5,5) is moving down to tail.\n> \n> But let's see the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,5), (6,2), (3,1).\n> \n> (1,5) has short life, only 2 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But (1,5) is at x=1,y=5. Snake head at (5,6), so it's a bit far.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) at x=6,y=2, life span 5.\n> \n> (3,1) at x=3,y=1, life span 8.\n> \n> Now, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid 8x8:\n> \n> Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n> \n> So the snake is like: from (5,6) right to (4,6) left? Positions: (5,6) head, then (4,6) which is left, so snake was moving right to (5,6), so from (4,6) to (5,6), direction R.\n> \n> Then next is (3,6), which is left of (4,6), so from (3,6) to (4,6) was right?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, I'm moving to (5,5), which had food? No, no food at (5,5), so I don't eat, so length same, tail moves.\n> \n> So after moving down to (5,5):\n> \n> - Head was (5,6), moves to (5,5)\n> \n> - The body: the segment that was at (5,5) is no longer tail, but since head moved to it, and no food, we remove the last segment, which was (5,5), but head is moving to it, so it's occupied, but we add new head at (5,5), and remove the tail (5,5), which is the same cell, so effectively, the snake moves, tail is cut off.\n> \n> New positions: the new head is at (5,5), then the previous positions from index 0 to 4: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), and (4,5) was index 4, but (5,5) was index 5 tail.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,5), then the first body segment is the old head (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (3,5), and the last segment (4,5) becomes the new tail, since we removed the old tail (5,5).\n> \n> List:\n> \n> Old positions: indices: 0: (5,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5) tail\n> \n> After move down: head moves to (5,5)\n> \n> New body: the old head becomes segment 1: (5,6), then segment 2: (4,6), segment 3: (3,6), segment 4: (3,5), segment 5: (4,5), and since no food eaten, we remove the last segment, which was (5,5), so the new tail is (4,5), and positions are: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> So the snake is now at: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Length still 6.\n> \n> From here, head at (5,5), direction is now down?

So (5,5) with direction D (down), which is decreasing y.\n> \n> Direction D means down, so y decreases. Snake head direction is D, so it was moving down to (5,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5) head, then (5,6) – that's above (5,5) since y=6 > y=5, so (5,6) is north of (5,5). But head is at (5,5) moving down? That might be inconsistent.\n> \n> List positions in order: index 0: (5,5) head, index 1: (5,6), index 2: (4,6), index 3: (3,6), index 4: (3,5), index 5: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So from head to tail: (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (4,5)\n> \n> But if head is at (5,5) and moving down, that means it came from above, so previous position was (5,6)? But (5,6) is the next segment, which makes sense. When moving down to (5,5), the head was at (5,6) before, and now it's at (5,5), so the body follows.\n> \n> Similarly, tail is at (4,5), which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, so eating any will increase length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: (1,5) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at turn t, life span N, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L turns, including turn t. After L turns, it disappears. So at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> In this case, turn 28, food at (1,5) has life span 1, so it will disappear after turn 28, meaning it's only available on turn 28. If not eaten on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 4, so available until turn 28+3=31? Turn t with life span L: present from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, countdown starts. After turn t, life span becomes L-1, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (1,5) at turn 28, life span 1: it is present on turn 28, and if not eaten, disappears before turn 29.\n> \n> For (6,2), life span 4: present from turn 28 to turn 31 (since 28 to 28+3=31, 4 turns: 28,29,30,31).\n> \n> Life span L means it will be available for L more turns including current. So at turn t, it has L turns left, so it disappears after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1. For example, N=1, disappears after turn t, so only on turn t. N=2, available turn t and t+1, disappears before t+2.\n> \n> Here, turn 28:\n> \n> - (1,5): life span 1, so only available on turn 28. Must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 4, available turn 28,29,30,31\n> \n> - (3,1): life span 7, available turn 28 to 34\n> \n> - (1,4): life span 10, available turn 28 to 37\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence starting from turn 28, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,5), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction is D, so cannot move U (up), because that would be opposite. So possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Reverse of D is U, so cannot move U. Can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - Move D (down): to (5,4)\n> \n> - Move L (left): to (4,5)\n> \n> - Move R (right): to (6,5)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (5,1) and (6,1) are obstacles, but not at head position.\n> \n> For move D to (5,4): is (5,4) a wall? Borders: y=0 and y=7, x=0,x=7. (5,4) is within bounds, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) is not listed, so should be free. Snake body: current positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5). (5,4) is not occupied by body, so should be safe to move to.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to new position, then body follows. After move, the tail will move away from its current position, so the head can move to where the tail was, as long as it's not colliding with other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,5), which is adjacent to head? Head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), which is left of head.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,5), that's where the tail is now. But since the tail will move when the snake moves, it might be okay, as long as after movement, no collision.\n> \n> General rule: moving into the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away, so the head won't collide with it after the move. But if there is food on the tail cell, and I eat it, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows into itself, causing collision.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, is the head adjacent to tail?\n> \n> Head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), which is left, so adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, is there food on the tail cell? Tail is at (4,5). Food positions: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1), (1,4). None at (4,5), so no food there. So moving to tail should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> First, let's list all food: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n> \n> Now, for turn 28, I need to decide action.\n> \n> But (1,5) has only this turn to be eaten, life span 1.\n> \n> Can I reach (1,5) this turn? Head at (5,5), (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, same row, but 4 cells left.\n> \n> Current position (5,5), to (1,5) is 4 steps left, but I can only move one step per turn. So impossible to reach in one turn. Therefore, (1,5) cannot be eaten on turn 28, so it will disappear after this turn, uneaten. So I should ignore it, as it's not reachable.\n> \n> Now, other food: (6,2) at (6,2), which is right and down from (5,5). (5,5) to (6,2): delta x=1, delta y=-3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> (3,1) at (3,1), which is left and down.\n> \n> (1,4) at (1,4), left and up? (1,4) y=4, head y=5, so down and left.\n> \n> But all not adjacent, so no food to eat immediately.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,5) with direction D:\n> \n> - D (down) to (5,4): what is at (5,4)? No wall, no food, no body? Body positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5). (5,4) is not in list, so empty. Walls: not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,4) not among, so free. So safe to move to (5,4).\n> \n> - L (left) to (4,5): (4,5) is current tail position. As per rules, moving to tail is allowed since no food there, and tail will move. After move, head at (4,5), body: new head is (4,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, so body at (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), and tail (4,5) was tail, but since we move to it, and if no food, tail moves from (4,5) to where? Snake grows only if eat food. No food at (4,5), so length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5)] with head (5,5).\n> \n> If move L to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), which was tail. Since no food there, snake does not grow, so tail moves away from (4,5). The tail was at (4,5), and the segment before tail is (3,5), so tail moves to the next position? When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So after moving left to (4,5):\n> \n> - Head now at (4,5)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,5)\n> \n> - Then next to (5,6)\n> \n> - Then to (4,6)\n> \n> - Then to (3,6)\n> \n> - Then to (3,5) — this was position 4, now it moves to position 3's old position, which is (3,6)? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: tail (4,5)\n> \n> After move left to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (now body) moves to old head position (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (tail) moves to old segment 4 position (3,5)\n> \n> Old segment 4 was (3,5), so tail moves to (3,5)\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Tail is now at (3,5), which was previously occupied, but since it moved, no collision.\n> \n> And (4,5) is now head, which was tail, but since tail moved, it's fine.\n> \n> Now, if there was food at (4,5), and we ate it, then snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head is at (4,5) with new tail at (4,5), but since it grew, the tail stays, causing head to collide with body immediately. But no food here.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (6,5): (6,5) is within bounds? x=6, y=5. Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not listed, so should be free. Snake body: not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> Move U: but cannot, because reverse, current direction D, U is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> First, the critical food is (1,5) which must be eaten now or lost, but it's too far, so lost.\n> \n> Now, other food: (6,2) life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 31.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 7, by turn 34.\n> \n> (1,4) life span 10, by turn 37.\n> \n> Snake is at (5,5), length 6.\n> \n> I should plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Walls: all borders are walls.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 bottom to top?

After eating, moving left ensures long-term survival by escaping the potential dead end near (6,2) and positioning the snake to target other food like (3,1) or (1,4) in future turns.\n",

These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (5,4), and it's moving down, as per head direction \"D\". Down means decreasing y, so from (5,5) to (5,4) would be down, but positions are listed head first, so head is (5,4), then body: (5,5), (5,6), etc. Since head direction is D, it was moving down to reach (5,4).\n> \n> Head direction is given as \"D\", which is the current direction it's facing after moving to (5,4). So from the previous position, it moved down to (5,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 4. So it will disappear after 4 more turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 29, life span is 4, meaning it will be there for turns 29,30,31,32, and disappear after turn 32 or at the start of turn 33? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, life span decreases at the end of the turn or something. The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". And \"disappears after N turns\". Since it includes current, for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be available for L turns starting from t, so it disappears after t + L - 1 or something. Let's think.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for example, at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at the end of turn t, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. But when it reaches 0, does it disappear at the end of the turn or beginning?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it will be gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, if life span is N at start of turn, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on.

Ate on turn 31, so length 7, after move without eating, tail removed, so length back to 6? No.\n> \n> When you eat, length increases permanently. On turn 31, when ate, length became 7. Then on turn 32, moving without eating, so head moves to new position, tail is removed, so length decreases? No, length stays the same, but the tail segment is removed only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so next move tail doesn't move, length increases. When you don't eat, tail moves forward, length same, but the segments shift.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when you eat, the new head is added, and tail stays, so length +1. When you don't eat, head moves to new cell, tail cell is removed, so length same.\n> \n> So after eating on turn 31, positions: head (6,2), and body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — 8 positions? No.\n> \n> Initial snake length 6 segments.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating, new head at (6,2), and the segment that was head is now body, so positions: new head (6,2), then old head (6,3), then the rest: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — that's 7 segments, since added one.\n> \n> Before eating, on turn 30, positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — 6 segments.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating, head (6,2), then the previous head becomes first body segment, so (6,3), then the previous body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — so 7 segments.\n> \n> Then on turn 32, move to (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) — and the tail (4,6) is removed. So positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) — 7 segments? (5,6) is included, but (4,6) removed.\n> \n> List: new head (5,2), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) — and (4,6) is gone. So segments: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) — that's 7 positions, but (5,3) to (5,6) are there, but (5,6) was not removed, only (4,6) was tail.\n> \n> Length is 7 after eating, so after moving without eating, it should be 7 segments, but tail removed, so one segment less? I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, length increases by one. Then when you move without eating, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed, but since length increased, it stays at the new length.\n> \n> For example, length 6, eat food, length 7. Then move without eating, head moves, tail moves, length still 7.\n> \n> In positions: after eating, positions have n+1 cells. Next move, head to new cell, the last cell (tail) is removed, so positions have n+1 cells still, but the tail position changed.\n> \n> In this case: after eating on turn 31, positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — 7 cells.\n> \n> On turn 32, move to (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), then the body is the first 6 of the previous positions except the head, but: the new body starts from the old head position.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (6,2), body segments (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,2), new head (5,2), then the previous head (6,2) becomes the first body segment, then the previous body segments except the last one is removed? No.\n> \n> The positions list: the new list is [new_head] + previous_positions[:-1] if no food, or [new_head] + previous_positions if food.\n> \n> When no food: new_positions = [new_head] + previous_positions[0:-1]  // remove tail\n> \n> When food: new_positions = [new_head] + previous_positions  // keep all, add new head, so length+1\n> \n> So on turn 31 after eating: positions = [ (6,2) ] + [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ] = [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ]\n> \n> On turn 32, move to (5,2), no food, so new_positions = [ (5,2) ] + previous_positions[0:-1] = [ (5,2) ] + [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ]  // removed (4,6)\n> \n> So snake: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n> \n> Tail is (5,6)\n> \n> Now head at (5,2), direction L (since moved left from (6,2)).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (5,2), can go U, D, L (not R, opposite to L).\n> \n> U to (5,3): but (5,3) is body, occupied.\n> \n> D to (5,1): (5,1) is obstacle!

It's turn 30, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7; those are out of bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments at (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake is moving downward, since head direction is D, and positions are decreasing in y from head to tail? Let's list them:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6) to (3,6). Since head is at (5,3) and direction is D (down), which is decreasing y? Typically in grids, y increases upward or downward? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upward? Let's see:\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — that means moving up increases y.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — moving down decreases y.\n> \n> So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (5,3), and direction D, which is down, so from (5,3) down to (5,2) would be next, but it's at (5,3) with body at (5,4), which has higher y, so if y increases upward, (5,4) is above (5,3), so the snake is moving downward from (5,4) to (5,3)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So head is (5,3), next segment is (5,4), which is directly above since y+1. But head direction is D, down. That means the snake was moving down from (5,4) to (5,3), so the previous move was down.\n> \n> Current head at (5,3), direction D, so last move was down to here. The body segments show the path: from head (5,3) to (5,4), which is backward in position list? No: position list is head to tail, so head (5,3), then the segment behind it is (5,4), meaning the neck is at (5,4), which is north of head since y=4 > y=3, so the head moved south to (5,3) from (5,4). Similarly, next segment is (5,5), then (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6).\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 30, for (6,2) life span 3, it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is how many turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn or after? Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t with life span N, after turn t is processed, life span becomes N-1. If it becomes 0, it disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to a food cell during a turn, it's eaten.\n> \n> Also, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on later.\n> \n> In this state, no food under body? Let's see food positions: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> (6,2) is empty, (3,1) empty, (1,4) empty. No food under snake.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,3), direction D, so possible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move U immediately because no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - D: down to (5,2) — y-1, so (5,2)\n> \n> - L: left to (4,3)\n> \n> - R: right to (6,3)\n> \n> But need to check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (5,2) is within bounds, y=2>0, x=5 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> (4,3): x=4>0, y=3 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> (6,3): x=6<7, y=3, but internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (6,4) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (6,3), which is not listed, so it should be free. Obstacles are specific cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (6,3) is not an obstacle, so it's free.\n> \n> Also, cannot move to body segments except the tail, which might move.\n> \n> Current body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> (5,2) is not occupied, (4,3) not, (6,3) not.\n> \n> But after moving, the body follows, so need to think about future positions.\n> \n> Goal is to maximize score by eating food, but avoid risks. Think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should have an action sequence for turn 30, 31, 32, etc., and a thinking conclusion.\n> \n> Since I need to think ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Available food:\n> \n> - (6,2): at (6,2), life span 3. Since turn 30, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 32? Countdown: at turn 30, life span 3; after turn 30, it becomes 2; after turn 31, it becomes 1; after turn 32, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 30, 31, or 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 5, so available until turn 34 (after turn 34 it disappears).\n> \n> (1,4): life span 8, available until turn 37.\n> \n> Now, distances:\n> \n> From head (5,3) to (6,2): |6-5| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 units, so at least 2 moves away.\n> \n> To (3,1): |3-5| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n> \n> To (1,4): |1-5| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5 units.\n> \n> But with obstacles, path might be longer.\n> \n> Also, need to consider the snake body and where it will be.\n> \n> Snake length is 6 segments: positions 6 cells.\n> \n> After eating positive food, length increases by 1, so next segment added.\n> \n> Now, I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate move at turn 30.\n> \n> Possible actions: D, L, R (not U, since reverse not allowed).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,2), what happens? (5,2) is not wall, not obstacle, not body? Body: (5,4), (5,5), etc., all different.\n> \n> (5,2) is below, so should be free.\n> \n> But after moving, the tail moves from (3,6) to where? When head moves to (5,2), the neck becomes (5,3), and each segment moves, so tail at (3,6) moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (4,6)? Let's think of the new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) tail.\n> \n> If head moves D to (5,2), then new head is (5,2), and the body segments follow: the segment that was at (5,3) is now at (5,3)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the body shifts: the first body segment (neck) moves to where head was, and so on.\n> \n> So after moving head to (5,2):\n> \n> - Head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,3)  // previous head position\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,4)  // previous position of segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,5)  // previous position of segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,6)  // previous position of segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,6)  // previous position of segment 4\n> \n> - Tail: (3,6) is gone? No, the tail moves to the previous position of segment 5, which was (4,6), but segment 5 was at (4,6), and it moves to where segment 4 was, which is (5,6).\n> \n> Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions index 0 to 5: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n> \n> After head moves to (5,2):\n> \n> - New position 0: (5,2)  // new head\n> \n> - Position 1: (5,3)  // old position 0\n> \n> - Position 2: (5,4)  // old position 1\n> \n> - Position 3: (5,5)  // old position 2\n> \n> - Position 4: (5,6)  // old position 3\n> \n> - Position 5: (4,6)  // old position 4\n> \n> - Old position 5 (3,6) is no longer part of snake; tail moved from (3,6) to (4,6), so (3,6) is empty now.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (4,3):\n> \n> New head (4,3), then body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Tail at (4,6), old tail (3,6) gone.\n> \n> If move right to (6,3):\n> \n> New head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, back to food: (6,2) is at (6,2), which is adjacent to (6,3) if I move right.\n> \n> From (5,3), moving R to (6,3) gets me closer to (6,2).\n> \n> Then from (6,3), I can move down to (6,2) to eat it, but need to check if possible.\n> \n> (6,2) is not occupied by body or obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,2) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> But life span of (6,2) is 3, so I can eat it on turn 30 if I go directly, but from (5,3) to (6,2) is not adjacent; I need two moves: first to (6,3) or (5,2), then to (6,2).\n> \n> If I move to (6,3) on turn 30, then on turn 31 I can move to (6,2) to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (5,2) on turn 30, then to (6,2) on turn 31.\n> \n> But (5,2) might be risky?

This ensures one food is eaten by turn 33 and positions the snake to safely pursue (1,4) next.\n",

It's turn 31. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (4,3) from (5,3), I think? Positions are listed head first: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)]. So from head to tail: head (4,3), next is (5,3), which is to the right, but head direction is L, left? That might be inconsistent.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, left. But the position before head was (5,3), and now head is (4,3), so moving from (5,3) to (4,3) is left, yes. Then the body: (5,3) is where the head was, then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), and tail (4,6). So the snake body goes from (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6). That means at (5,3), it turned down or something? Let's see the path.\n> \n> Previous positions: head was at (5,3) at turn 30, I assume. Moved left to (4,3). Before that, at turn 29, head was at (5,4) or something? The positions: from (4,3) to (5,3) would be right, but it moved left to (4,3), so previous was (5,3). Then (5,3) came from where? The segment after head is (5,3), which was the head position before moving to (4,3). Then (5,4) is next, so at some point, it was at (5,4) and moved down? Let's list the segments:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,3)  // this was head at turn 30\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,4)  // head at turn 29?\n> \n> I think it's better to think of the current positions without history.

So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L more turns? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears. So it is present on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> For (6,2): life_span 2 at turn 31. So on turn 31, countdown=2, present. On turn 32, countdown=1, present.

It's turn 32. The grid has walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body segments at (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 1, value +1 (since it says value1=1, and it's positive food)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 3, value +1\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 9, value +1\n> \n> All food here is positive, value 1, so no negative food in this state. Good, I only need to eat to grow and avoid risks.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So for (6,2), life span 1 means it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 32, after this action, if not eaten, it will be gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N, it will disappear after N more turns. At the turn it's spawned, life span is N, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" and for (6,2) it's life_span=1. Since we're at turn t1=32, this food will disappear after turn 32, meaning if not eaten on turn 32, it's gone for turn 33 onwards. Similarly, (3,1) life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, i.e., after turn 34 if not eaten.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it lasts for N turns starting from now. For example, life span 1: if not eaten on this turn (turn 32), it disappears immediately after. Life span 3: it will be there for turns 32,33,34, and disappear after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for multiple turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 32, 33, 34, etc., and a thinking conclusion.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the body goes from (3,3) right to (5,3), then up to (5,6). (4,3) to (5,3) is right, then (5,3) to (5,4) is up, (5,4) to (5,5) up, (5,5) to (5,6) up. Head at (3,3) moving left, so last move was from (4,3) to (3,3), left.\n> \n> Possible moves from head (3,3): since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because reverse is not allowed? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current head direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves from (3,3): U (up, to (3,4)), D (down, to (3,2)), L (left, to (2,3)). Cannot move R to (4,3) because that's reverse and also (4,3) is the body.\n> \n> (4,3) is the first body segment, so moving to (4,3) would cause collision with body. Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6). If I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but only if it's the tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,3), possible safe moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,4): is this safe? (3,4) – let's see what's there. Snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So (3,4) is not occupied, but is it a wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2). (3,4) is not a wall, so U to (3,4) should be safe.\n> \n> - D to (3,2): (3,2) – not snake, not wall? Walls: y=0 is bottom, so (3,2) is within bounds, not internal obstacle. Internal obstacles listed, (3,2) not there. So D to (3,2) safe.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): (2,3) – not snake, not wall? Internal obstacles have (2,4), but (2,3) is different. Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, (2,3) is fine. So L to (2,3) safe.\n> \n> Cannot move R to (4,3) because it's body and also reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 1, value +1\n> \n> - (3,1): life span 3, value +1\n> \n> - (1,4): life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 9, value +1\n> \n> (6,2) has only 1 turn left, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> But (6,2) is at x=6,y=2. Head is at (3,3), so not adjacent; it's 3 steps away at least. To reach (6,2) from (3,3), need to go right and down, but head direction is left, and I can't move right this turn.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) has internal obstacles nearby: (6,1) and (6,4) are obstacles, but (6,2) is clear.\n> \n> But to get to (6,2) quickly: from (3,3), if I go down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), but (4,2) might be safe? Let's see possible paths.\n> \n> First, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Since (6,2) has only one turn left, I might not be able to reach it in time. Let's calculate distance.\n> \n> From (3,3) to (6,2): delta x = +3, delta y = -1. So minimum 3 moves if I go right, but I can't go right this turn because reverse not allowed and it's body.\n> \n> This turn, I can only go U, D, or L.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,3), then from there, I can go to (2,2) or (2,4) or (1,3), etc.\n> \n> But (2,2) has food with life span 9, so it will last.\n> \n> (6,2) is far and time-sensitive.\n> \n> Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4. But since I can only move one cell per turn, and I need to eat it this turn to get it, but head is at (3,3), food at (6,2), not adjacent, so impossible to eat this turn. Therefore, (6,2) will disappear after this turn; I cannot eat it. So I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n> \n> Life span 1 means after this turn, it disappears. Since I can't reach it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,1) life span 3, so available for turns 32,33,34.\n> \n> (1,4) life span 6, available longer.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9, available longest.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), food at (3,1) is below, at (3,1), so directly below head, distance |3-3| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2, so I can reach in 2 turns if I go down directly.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is at left-down, from (3,3) to (2,2) is |2-3| + |2-3| =1+1=2, also 2 turns away.\n> \n> (1,4) is at |1-3| + |4-3| =2+1=3 turns away.\n> \n> Now, snake body: after moving, the tail will move, so cells might free up.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n> \n> After one move, say I move head to a new position, then the body follows, and tail moves away from (5,6).\n> \n> So the cell (5,6) will be vacated after this move, but only if the snake moves, which it does.\n> \n> Now, I need to avoid collisions and plan a path.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,6), head is at (3,3), not adjacent.

Not snake, not wall. Snake is at (5,4) but that's different. (3,4) is empty. Walls: internal (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not (2,4), so ok. So (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Move D to (3,2): (3,2) free, no snake or wall.\n> \n> Move L to (2,3): (2,3) free, but there is an obstacle at (2,4), but (2,3) is different.\n> \n> (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,3) is not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,3), that might be closer to food (2,2) or (1,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) close to (3,1) food.\n> \n> (3,4) might lead to other areas.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> Let me simulate a few moves.\n> \n> First, for turn 32, I need to choose an action.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (3,2)\n> \n> Then new head position (3,2), body: head (3,2), then previous head (3,3) becomes body, so positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] and tail (5,6) is gone, so snake is now from (3,2) to (5,5), length still 6 since no food eaten.\n> \n> (5,6) was tail, after move, tail moves to (5,5)? Let's see: when head moves to (3,2), the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to the old head position (3,3), second to old first body (4,3), and so on, up to the tail.

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are deadly. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are cells I cannot move into.\n> - **Snake Positions**: Head at (3,2), then body segments at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means it was moving downwards to (3,2) from (3,3)? Positions are listed head first: (3,2) is head, then (3,3) is next, which is above it since y increases upwards? No, in grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if D is down, y decreases as we go down. So (3,2) to (3,3) – if (3,2) is head and (3,3) is the next segment, that means the head is below the neck, so it was moving down to (3,2). But head direction is given as D, which is the current direction it's facing. So at (3,2), it's moving down.\n> \n> List the snake positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> - Neck: (3,3) – since head is at (3,2) and neck at (3,3), that means the snake was moving down to (3,2), so from (3,3) to (3,2), direction down.\n> \n> Then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it can move to adjacent cells except opposite direction, which is U, since reverse is not allowed instantly.\n> \n> Possible moves from head (3,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,3) – but (3,3) is occupied by the snake body, so that would be a collision, deadly.

So (3,1): x=3, y=1, not border, and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (5,1) is an obstacle, but (3,1) is not listed, so it should be free unless occupied.\n> \n> (2,2): not in obstacles list.\n> \n> (4,2): not in obstacles.\n> \n> But also, need to see if these cells are occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So (3,1) is not occupied, (2,2) not occupied, (4,2) not occupied.\n> \n> But (3,3) is occupied, but we already know U is invalid.\n> \n> Also, for moving, if I move to a cell, it must not be occupied except for the tail, but since the tail moves, it's okay if I move to where the tail is, as long as it's not colliding with other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,5), which is far, so all adjacent cells except (3,3) are free.\n> \n> (3,1), (2,2), (4,2) all seem free.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (3,1, 3, 1) : position (3,1), value 1, life span 3 turns (including current turn, I think, since countdown decreases every turn including current)\n> \n> Food life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 33, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 turns, so at turn 36 it should be gone? Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 33, if life span is 3, it has 3 turns left: turn 33,34,35, gone at turn 36. But since we act on turn 33, we can eat it on turn 33,34, or 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4, 5, 1): position (1,4), value 1, life span 5\n> \n> (2,2, 8, 1): position (2,2), value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All foods have value 1, so all positive food? Value is 1, which is positive, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Value: for positive food, +1, for negative, -1. Here all have value 1, so all positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) bottom left? Or top left? Doesn't matter, but since U is y+1, D is y-1, let's assume y=0 is bottom for simplicity, so U increases y.\n> \n> But in positions, head at (3,2), which is above y=1 and below y=3, etc.\n> \n> List all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – these are single cells that are blocked.\n> \n> Snake: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Food: (3,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2) is food, and (2,2) is adjacent to head (3,2), since left move.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is directly below, down move.\n> \n> (1,4) is at (1,4), which is left and up from head.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), so (1,4) is x=1,y=4, head is x=3,y=2, so delta x=-2, delta y=+2.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U: (3,3) – occupied by snake body, collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,1) – has food, value 1, and not occupied except if we move there.\n> \n> - L: (2,2) – has food, value 1\n> \n> - R: (4,2) – no food, empty\n> \n> But R to (4,2) is safe, no food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, head direction is D, so I cannot move U next turn because of no instant reverse.

Then snake grows, so new positions: head at (3,1), body adds a segment, so tail stays or moves? When eating, length increases, so after move, head moves to (3,1), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since the tail moves only when not eating. In this game, when you eat positive food, length +1, so the tail doesn't move, a new segment is added.\n> \n> The rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So after eating, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Movement: each turn, head moves to new cell, and if no food eaten, tail moves one cell forward, so length same. If food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment is effectively added at the position where tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the segment before tail becomes new tail or something.\n> \n> Positions: after move, if not eating, head to new cell, tail removed from end.

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm the grid size. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7 are walls, so the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). But let's check the snake positions: head at (4,2), which is within 1 to 6 in both x and y, so yes, playable area is (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – so these are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is R (right), so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,1), life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns including current, so at turn 34, it has 2 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it lasts for N more turns including the current one.\n> \n> The description says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span N, it will be gone by turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn 34, life span 2: it will be present on turn 34 and 35, and disappear at the start of turn 36 or something. But for movement, we care about whether it's there when we move.\n> \n> Since we're at turn 34, and we're deciding the action for turn 34, the food is present now. After we move, the turn increments, and life span decreases.\n> \n> When we take an action, it's for the current turn, so at turn t, we move, then after the move, the state updates.\n> \n> But for food life span, it decreases each turn, so at the beginning of turn t, the life span is as given, and after the turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, when we are at turn t, the life span value is how many more turns it will last, including turn t. So for (3,1) with life span 2 at turn 34: it will be available to eat on turn 34 and 35. If not eaten by then, it disappears before turn 36.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) life span 4: available turns 34,35,36,37.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 7: turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> (2,3) life span 10: turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> All values are +1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,2), moving right. So from (4,2), moving right would go to (5,2), but let's see what's at (5,2).\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position: head at (4,2), direction R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so opposite is L (left). So I cannot move L on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, to (4,3)? y increases when up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> So from (4,2):\n> \n> - U: (4,3)\n> \n> - D: (4,1)\n> \n> - R: (5,2)  // since current direction R, moving R is allowed\n> \n> - L: (3,2) but L is opposite to R, so cannot move L because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Cannot move to cells that are walls, obstacles, or body except tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> - (4,3): is this free? Snake positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> So (4,3) is part of the body, it's the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,2), index 1: (3,2), index 2: (3,3), index 3: (4,3), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (5,4)\n> \n> So (4,3) is occupied by body segment, so moving to (4,3) would cause collision, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is also body, segment 1.\n> \n> (5,2) is not in snake positions, so might be free.\n> \n> (4,1) not listed, so might be free.\n> \n> But we have walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for (4,1): x=4, y=1, y=1 is not y=0, so not wall. y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border wall? Border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (4,1) has y=1, which is not 0 or 7, so not wall.

It's turn 35. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at those edges, meaning the snake can't go there. Also, internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (4,1) and direction is down. But (4,1) is y=1, and down would decrease y, so moving down from (4,1) would go to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that would be a collision. That can't be right. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as \"D\" for down. But the snake positions are listed as [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. If the head is at (4,1) and it was moving down, but down from (4,1) would be to (4,0), which is a wall. But the previous position is (4,2), which is above it, so if it was moving down to (4,1), that makes sense because from (4,2) to (4,1) is down. Direction is the current head direction, which is the direction it just moved to get to (4,1). So, since it came from (4,2) to (4,1), that is down, so direction is D. Now, for the next move, I can choose to go up, down, left, or right, but with no instant reverse, so I cannot go up (U) because that would be opposite to down.\n> \n> Current head at (4,1), direction D. Possible moves: not U (since reverse), so can go D, L, or R.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,1)\n> \n> But (5,1) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is listed, so (5,1) is a wall, so cannot go right to (5,1).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, so cells that are occupied by walls cannot be moved into.\n> \n> So from (4,1):\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left (L): (3,1) - let's see if it's free\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,1) - internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Up (U): but reverse, not allowed since current direction is D, cannot go U.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (3,1)? But (3,1) might have food or something, but let's check the food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1,1,1) : position (3,1), value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,4,3,1) : (1,4), value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,2,6,1) : (2,2), value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,3,9,1) : (2,3), value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) has food with life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 35, life span is 1, so if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn. So it must be eaten on this turn to get it.\n> \n> But can we eat it? The snake head is at (4,1), and if we move left to (3,1), that is the food cell.\n> \n> But there's a rule about food under the body. (3,1) is not under the snake body? Snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (3,1) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free to move to.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid. Cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (3,1): is it occupied? Snake head is at (4,1), body at (4,2), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is not listed in snake positions, and not a wall except the borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,1) is not among them, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, food is at (3,1), so if we move left to (3,1), we eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,1), tail at (5,3). Distance: |4-5|=1, |1-3|=2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,1) and (5,3): not adjacent, since different x and y differ by more than 1 in one direction.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,1) has neighbors: (4,0), (4,2), (3,1), (5,1). (5,1) is wall, (4,0) wall, (4,2) is body, (3,1) is food.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (4,1). So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (3,1) should be safe and we eat the food, increasing length by 1.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from current position.\n> \n> As I thought, only left to (3,1) is possible, since down and right are invalid, up is reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Down to (4,0) wall, right to (5,1) wall, up to (4,2) but (4,2) is the second segment, body, so if we move up, head to (4,2), which is occupied by body, collision. I forgot that.\n> \n> Possible moves: to adjacent cells that are not walls and not body except tail.\n> \n> General rule: cannot move to body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,2) - occupied by body (second segment), so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> - Down: (4,0) - wall, collision.\n> \n> - Left: (3,1) - not occupied, has food.\n> \n> - Right: (5,1) - internal obstacle, wall, collision.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is Left to (3,1).\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 35, we must move L to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, after moving to (3,1), we eat the food, so snake grows. New snake positions: when we move, head goes to (3,1), and since we eat food, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (3,1), then the previous head (4,1) becomes body, so [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]? Let's see the order.\n> \n> Original positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (3,1), head moves to (3,1), and since we eat food, we add a segment, so the body remains, and a new segment is added at the head position. Standard snake: when you eat food, the tail stays, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,1), then the previous segments: (4,1) becomes first body, then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) is still tail.

Subsequent moves prioritize eating all accessible positive food (at (2,2), (2,3), and (1,4)) while steering clear of dead ends and obstacles, ensuring long-term survival by growing the snake and opening paths. The sequence avoids the fatal trap at (1,1) by moving up on turn 37 and leverages the snake's growth to navigate safely around walls and internal obstacles.\n",

After move, the tail will move, so (3,1) will be vacated, but when I move to (3,1), it's currently occupied, but since it's the second segment, which is connected to head, moving there might cause collision? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but exception for tail.\n> \n> In this case, (3,1) is not the tail; the tail is (4,3). Let's list positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (2,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: tail (4,3)\n> \n> So (3,1) is segment 1, which is adjacent to head. If I move right to (3,1), that would be moving into the neck, which should cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But (3,1) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head. So moving to (3,1) should be invalid because it would collide with body.\n> \n> Confirming: after moving, the new head position would be (3,1), but before moving, (3,1) is occupied by segment 1, so when head moves there, it's touching the body segment that hasn't moved yet. So collision.\n> \n> Only moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (2,2): free cell, has food\n> \n> - Left to (1,1): free cell, no food?

(0,0) bottom left? Usually in coordinates, but direction: U is y+1, so probably y increases up, like standard math coordinates.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), etc., and head direction L, so from (3,1) to (2,1), so x decreasing.\n> \n> Let me list cells:\n> \n> Row y=0: wall\n> \n> y=1: x=0 wall, x=1: (1,1) free? But (1,2) obstacle, so (1,1) should be accessible? x=2: snake head (2,1), x=3: snake (3,1), x=4: snake (4,1), x=5: free? But (5,1) is obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1) is internal obstacle, so (5,1) blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So for y=1: x=0 wall, x=1 free? (1,1) not obstacle, x=2 snake, x=3 snake, x=4 snake (4,1), x=5 obstacle (5,1), x=6 obstacle (6,1), x=7 wall.\n> \n> (4,1) is snake, (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle.\n> \n> y=2: x=0 wall, x=1: (1,2) obstacle, so blocked, x=2: (2,2) has food, free?

Possible moves: U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2), I eat the food there, since (2,2) has food, value +1, snake length increases by 1. So new length 8.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. Positions: new head at (2,2), then the body: previous head (2,1) becomes new segment, so positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] and since we ate, tail stays at (4,3)? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since length increases, the tail doesn't move; it stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows, and since length increases, the tail end doesn't move, so effectively, the tail is extended.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: H(2,1), B1(3,1), B2(4,1), B3(4,2), B4(3,2), B5(3,3), T(4,3)\n> \n> After moving U to (2,2) and eating: new head at (2,2), then the previous head (2,1) is now segment 1, then B1(3,1) becomes segment 2, B2(4,1) segment 3, B3(4,2) segment 4, B4(3,2) segment 5, B5(3,3) segment 6, T(4,3) segment 7, and since we ate, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail is still at (4,3), but now it's segment 7, and segment 8 is also at (4,3)? No, that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong. In snake, when you eat, you grow by one, so after moving, the tail doesn't advance, so the new positions are: head at new position, then the previous positions up to the tail, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment stays, so the snake gains a segment at the tail end.\n> \n> For example: positions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head at new pos, then [H, B1, ..., Bk] where Bk was T, and new tail is the previous position of Bk-1 or something.\n> \n> Standard: the body follows the head. When head moves to a new cell, it becomes new head, the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> If no eat, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> If eat, then after moving, the tail position stays, so a new segment is added there, meaning the tail remains in place for this turn.\n> \n> So in this case, moving to (2,2) and eating: new positions: head (2,2), then the old head (2,1) is now body segment 1, then old B1 (3,1) is segment 2, old B2 (4,1) segment 3, old B3 (4,2) segment 4, old B4 (3,2) segment 5, old B5 (3,3) segment 6, old tail (4,3) segment 7, and since ate, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so segment 8 at (4,3). But (4,3) now has two segments? No, the tail doesn't move, so segment 7 is still at (4,3), and segment 8 is also at (4,3)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves one step: head to new cell, each body segment to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> If no eat, the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eat, the tail cell is not vacated; it remains occupied, and the snake length increases, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> In positions list: before move: [H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, T]\n> \n> After move to new cell without eat: [new H, H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5]  so T is gone.\n> \n> With eat: [new H, H, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, T]  so T stays, length +1.\n> \n> In this case, after moving U to (2,2) and eating: new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1) (old head), then (3,1) (old B1), (4,1) (old B2), (4,2) (old B3), (3,2) (old B4), (3,3) (old B5), and (4,3) (old tail), so positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] with head at (2,2), tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Length 8.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,1), no food there, so no eat, then new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1) (old head), (3,1) (old B1), (4,1) (old B2), (4,2) (old B3), (3,2) (old B4), (3,3) (old B5), so tail moves to (3,3)?

Moving to (2,1) would cause collision because the head would touch the body segment before it moves away. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to (2,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment, after the move, the second segment will move to where the third segment was, and so on. But at the moment of move, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but if it's a body segment that isn't the tail, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (2,1) is the second segment, not the tail.

If head moves to (2,1), it would collide with segment 1, which is still there. So Down is not possible; it's a collision.\n> \n> Left: to (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] so (1,2) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Right: to (3,2) – (3,2) is segment 5 in the snake body?

If head moves to (3,2), it would be moving to a cell occupied by segment 5, which is not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Up: to (2,3) – (2,3) is a food position, but is it occupied by the snake? Looking at snake positions, (2,3) is not listed, so it's empty except for food.

Tail (4,3) is not among them; (4,3) is two right and one up, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So Tail Reward Danger does not apply here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,3) should be safe and I eat the positive food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new tail added. Current length 8, after eating, length 9.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 38, action must be U, since it's the only choice.\n> \n> But let me confirm if there are other options. Is there a way to not move up? But no, other moves are invalid.\n> \n> L to (1,2) is wall, R to (3,2) is body, D to (2,1) is body and opposite direction. So only U is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 38, action is U.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,3), head is at (2,3), and since I ate food, the tail doesn't move? No, when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position or something? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the next time you move, the tail doesn't advance; you add a segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, head at (2,2), body to tail at (4,3).\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3), since (2,3) had food, and I eat it, so the snake grows: the head moves to (2,3), and a new segment is added where the head was, but the body shifts.\n> \n> Sequence: the head moves to new cell. If it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. If not, tail moves forward.\n> \n> So here: head moves from (2,2) to (2,3), eats food, so tail remains at (4,3), and the segment that was at (2,2) becomes part of body, so new positions: head at (2,3), then previous head (2,2) is now first body segment, then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail. So tail is still (4,3), and length is 9 now.\n> \n> Positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head direction: now it moved U to (2,3), so direction is U.\n> \n> Now, turn 39.\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Food: (2,3) was eaten, so removed. Remaining food: (1,3) with life span 9, value 1.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including when eaten? Life span is for how long the food exists, not related to when eaten.\n> \n> Food at (1,3) has life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 38 + 9 = turn 47? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 38 when we start. At turn 38, we move, and after move, we check if food eaten.\n> \n> Food life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For food at (2,3), life span 7 at turn 38. After turn 38, it will decrease to 6, and so on, until 0 it disappears.\n> \n> But at turn 38, we moved to (2,3) and ate it, so it's consumed, removed.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) has life span 9 at turn 38. After turn 38, it will have life span 8, then 7, etc., until eaten or expired.\n> \n> Now turn 39, head at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n> \n> U: to (2,4)\n> \n> L: to (1,3)\n> \n> R: to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> (2,4): is it wall or obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), which is a wall. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> L: (1,3) - not wall, and has food? Food at (1,3) is still there.\n> \n> Is (1,3) occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). (1,3) not among them, so free.\n> \n> R: (3,3) - (3,3) is a body segment? Positions: (3,3) is index 7 in the list, which is a body segment. Not tail, tail is (4,3), so if move to (3,3), it would collide with body segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (2,3), index 1: (2,2), index 2: (2,1), index 3: (3,1), index 4: (4,1), index 5: (4,2), index 6: (3,2), index 7: (3,3), index 8: tail (4,3)\n> \n> So (3,3) is occupied by index 7, not tail, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (1,3) possible.\n> \n> R to (3,3) collision, invalid.\n> \n> D is opposite, and also (2,2) is body, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (1,3).\n> \n> (1,3) has food, positive.\n> \n> Now, Tail Reward Danger: head at (2,3), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (2,3) to (4,3): delta x=2, delta y=0, not adjacent. Adjacent would be like (1,3), (3,3), (2,4), (2,2). Tail (4,3) is not adjacent; it's two away. So no danger.\n> \n> So moving to (1,3) should be safe and eat the food.\n> \n> Then after eating, snake grows to length 10.\n> \n> Positions: head to (1,3), previous head (2,3) becomes body, etc., tail stays.\n> \n> But we need to think further.\n> \n> First, for turn 39, action L.\n> \n> Now turn 40.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Now possible moves: from (1,3), can go U, D, L, R? But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, cannot move right.\n> \n> So possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> U: to (1,4)\n> \n> D: to (1,2)\n> \n> L: to (0,3)\n> \n> Now, (1,2): internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> (0,3): x=0, border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> (1,4): is it free? Walls: border y=0,7, x=0,7. (1,4) x=1,y=4, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (1,4) not among, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: after moving to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> (1,4) not occupied, so U to (1,4) possible.\n> \n> D to (1,2) is wall.\n> \n> L to (0,3) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (1,4).\n> \n> No food there, I think. Food was at (1,3), eaten, so no other food mentioned.\n> \n> Food positions: only two were given, both eaten by now? (2,3) eaten turn 38, (1,3) eaten turn 39, so no food left? But life span, but both eaten.\n> \n> In the state, food: (2,3,7,1) and (1,3,9,1), both eaten by turn 39.\n> \n> But no new food is given, so probably no food on the grid now.\n> \n> After turn 39, no food.\n> \n> But food might respawn or something? The problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so I think for now, no food.\n> \n> So turn 40: head at (1,3), move U to (1,4).\n> \n> After move, no eat, so tail moves: head to (1,4), body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail was (4,3), but since no eat, tail moves to where? The tail segment advances to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n> \n> After move head to (1,4), and since no eat, tail is removed? No, the snake moves, so the last segment (tail) is removed, and new head position.\n> \n> New positions: head at (1,4), then the previous positions shifted: segment after head is (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and the tail (4,3) is gone, so the new tail is (3,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> Index: before move: 0: (1,3) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3) tail\n> \n> After move: head to (1,4), so new head (1,4), then segment 1 becomes (1,3) (previous head), segment 2 becomes (2,3) (previous seg1), and so on, up to segment 9 becomes (3,3) (previous seg8), and the tail (4,3) is not included, so the new tail is (3,3)? Positions: new index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (3,3) tail? But (3,3) was segment 8 before, now it's the last.\n> \n> After no eat, the tail cell is vacated, and the new tail is the second last segment now last.\n> \n> So positions after turn 40 move: head (1,4), body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), tail (3,3)\n> \n> Length is still 10? No, when no eat, length doesn't increase, but we ate twice, so length was 8, after turn 38 eat, length 9, after turn 39 eat, length 10, then turn 40 no eat, so length 10, but after move, since no eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, but in terms of positions, the snake has one less segment? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail is removed, so length decreases? No, that's not right.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> Snake growth: when it eats, it grows, so length increases. When it doesn't eat, it moves but length stays the same, meaning the tail moves to the position of the second last, so the last position is vacated.\n> \n> In positions: for a snake of length L, positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_{L-2}, tail]\n> \n> After move with no eat: head moves to new position, seg1 moves to head old, seg2 to seg1 old, ..., tail moves to the position that was seg_{L-2} old, and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So the number of segments remains the same, but positions shift.\n> \n> In this case, before turn 40 move: positions: 10 segments: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> After move to (1,4) no eat: new head (1,4), then (1,3) (was head), (2,3) (was seg1), (2,2) (was seg2), (2,1) (was seg3), (3,1) (was seg4), (4,1) (was seg5), (4,2) (was seg6), (3,2) (was seg7), (3,3) (was seg8), and the last was (4,3), but it's not included; instead, the new tail is (3,3), which was the second last.\n> \n> So positions now: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 39:\n\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n  - **Border walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - **Internal obstacles**: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - **Positions**: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] (head first, then body segments).\n  - **Head Direction**: Up (U).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - Only one piece at (1,3) with value +1 and life span 8.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 39\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,3), and it's currently moving Up (from (2,2) to (2,3)). Possible moves from (2,3):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,4)**:\n   - (2,4) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (2,2)**:\n   - (2,2) is the first body segment (not the tail) → Moving here would cause a collision → **Invalid**.\n   - Additionally, moving Down is the opposite of the current direction (Up), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,3)**:\n   - (1,3) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - It's occupied by positive food (+1).\n   - It's not occupied by any body segment (current body positions are listed, and (1,3) isn't among them).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger Check**: Head is at (2,3), tail is at (4,3). They are not adjacent (distance of 2 horizontally) → No danger.\n   - **Valid and beneficial** (eat food, grow length by 1).\n\n4. **Right (R) to (3,3)**:\n   - (3,3) is occupied by the 7th body segment (not the tail) → Moving here would cause a collision → **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid and safe move is **Left (L) to (1,3)** to eat the positive food.\n\n### Verifying the Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (1,3):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (1,3).\n- **New Body**: The previous head (2,3) becomes the first body segment, and the rest follow. Since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by 1.\n  - New positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)].\n- **New Length**: 10 segments.\n- **Head Direction**: Now Left (L) (since we moved Left).\n\n### Subsequent Moves (Turns 40+)\n\nSince the guidance from the previous thinking model provides a sequence up to Turn 43, we can follow it to ensure consistency and safety:\n\n1. **Turn 40**: From (1,3), direction Left (L).\n   - Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n     - **Up (U) to (1,4)**:\n       - (1,4) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body (current body: (2,3), (2,2), etc., (1,4) not listed) → **Valid**.\n     - **Down (D) to (1,2)**:\n       - (1,2) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n     - **Left (L) to (0,3)**:\n       - x=0 is a border wall → **Invalid**.\n     - **Right (R) to (2,3)**:\n       - (2,3) is the first body segment (not tail) → Collision → **Invalid**.\n   - **Only valid move**: Up (U) to (1,4).\n\n2. **Turn 41**: From (1,4), direction Up (U).\n   - Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n     - **Up (U) to (1,5)**:\n       - (1,5) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n     - **Down (D) to (1,3)**:\n       - (1,3) is the first body segment (not tail) → Collision → **Invalid**.\n       - Also, Down is opposite to current direction (Up) → Not allowed.\n     - **Left (L) to (0,4)**:\n       - x=0 is a border wall → **Invalid**.\n     - **Right (R) to (2,4)**:\n       - (2,4) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n   - **Only valid move**: Up (U) to (1,5).\n\n3. **Turn 42**: From (1,5), direction Up (U).\n   - Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n     - **Up (U) to (1,6)**:\n       - (1,6) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n     - **Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n       - (1,4) is the first body segment (not tail) → Collision → **Invalid**.\n       - Also, Down is opposite to current direction (Up) → Not allowed.\n     - **Left (L) to (0,5)**:\n       - x=0 is a border wall → **Invalid**.\n     - **Right (R) to (2,5)**:\n       - (2,5) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n   - **Choices**: Up (U) to (1,6) or Right (R) to (2,5).\n     - Moving Right is better to avoid getting cornered at the top-left.\n\n4. **Turn 43**: From (2,5), direction Right (R).\n   - Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n     - **Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n       - (2,6) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n     - **Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n       - (2,4) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n     - **Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n       - (1,5) is the first body segment (not tail) → Collision → **Invalid**.\n       - Also, Left is opposite to current direction (Right) → Not allowed.\n     - **Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n       - (3,5) is not a wall or obstacle.\n       - Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n   - **Choices**: Up (U) to (2,6) or Right (R) to (3,5).\n     - Moving Right continues the path towards the center.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 39\n\nBased on the above analysis, the immediate action at Turn 39 is to move Left to eat the positive food at (1,3). This is the only safe and beneficial move available.\n\n### Action Sequence (for reference)\n\nThe previous thinking model provided a sequence up to Turn 43, but since the current task is to decide the immediate action for Turn 39, we focus on that:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Since it's turn 39, this food will disappear after 8 more turns, so at turn 47. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 39, life span becomes 7, then 6, etc., until turn 47 when it disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 39. I should think about maximizing score while avoiding risks.

Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,3)  // tail\n> \n> From the list: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> So positions: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> Now, food at (1,3) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), and food is at (1,3), which is directly left of the head. Since head direction is Up, moving Left is possible, but I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3): Up, Down, Left, Right, but considering walls and body.\n> \n> - Up: to (2,4). Is (2,4) available? (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, from the list: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (2,4) is an obstacle, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: to (2,2). But (2,2) is the first body segment. If I move down to (2,2), that's where the body is, but since the snake will move, the tail will move away, so moving to the current tail position is ok, but (2,2) is not the tail; the tail is (4,3). Let's see what happens when the snake moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position, so cells occupied by the body might change.\n> \n> Specifically, for collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves. So if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe, but if it moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that isn't the tail, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: to (1,3). (1,3) has food, and it's not occupied by body? Current body positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). (1,3) is not in this list, so it's empty except for food. Also, is it a wall? x=1, y=3, not a border wall, and not an internal obstacle; obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (1,2) is different from (1,3), so (1,3) is free.\n> \n> - Right: to (3,3). (3,3) is occupied by segment 7? Positions: index 7 is (3,3), which is a body segment. When we move, if head moves to (3,3), which is currently occupied by a body part, but since the snake moves, that body part will shift. (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,3). After head moves, the body segments follow, so the segment that was at (3,3) will move to where the head was or something. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, for a move to be safe, the new head position must not be a wall, not an obstacle, and not occupied by any body segment except the current tail position, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,3): current position (3,3) is occupied by segment 7. After move, if head moves to (3,3), that cell will have the head, but segment 7 was there, so it would be a collision unless it's the tail, which it's not. Tail is (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (2,2): (2,2) is segment 1, not tail.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,4) is obstacle.\n> \n> Moving left to (1,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> What about down? Down to (2,2), occupied by body.\n> \n> But let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North/Up: (2,4) - obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - South/Down: (2,2) - occupied by body (segment 1), and not tail, so collision if moved there\n> \n> - West/Left: (1,3) - empty, has food\n> \n> - East/Right: (3,3) - occupied by body (segment 7), not tail, collision\n> \n> So the only possible move is Left to (1,3), which has the food.\n> \n> But there's a catch: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> First, is the head adjacent to the tail? Head at (2,3), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (2,3) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart horizontally. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (2,3) and (4,3) are not adjacent; (3,3) is between them, but (3,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Adjacency: cells that are next to each other horizontally or vertically, so distance 1.\n> \n> (2,3) to (3,3) is adjacent, (3,3) to (4,3) is adjacent, but (2,3) to (4,3) is not directly adjacent; it's diagonal or not sharing edge.\n> \n> So head at (2,3) and tail at (4,3) are not adjacent. Therefore, Tail Reward Danger does not apply here.\n> \n> Moreover, the food is at (1,3), not on the tail. Tail is at (4,3), no food there.\n> \n> So moving left to (1,3) seems safe and I can eat the food, increasing length by 1.\n> \n> But life span is 8, so I have time, but since it's the only food and close, I might as well eat it now.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. After eating, the snake grows, and I need to find a path to survive.\n> \n> Also, the action sequence should be for multiple turns, at least 5.\n> \n> First, for turn 39, move Left to (1,3).\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake will have new positions: head moves to (1,3), then body: since it ate food, length increases, so tail doesn't move; new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so when head moves to a food cell, the tail stays in place, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, head moves to food cell, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so new segment added.\n> \n> So after moving left to (1,3) and eating food, new positions: head at (1,3), then the previous head (2,3) becomes body, so positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]? Let's see:\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After move left: head to (1,3). Since it eats food, tail stays, so new head is (1,3), then body: position 0 becomes body at (2,3), then position 1 at (2,2), ..., up to position 8 at (4,3), and since food eaten, no tail movement, so new segment added? The tail doesn't move, so the body gains a segment.\n> \n> Positions after: head at (1,3), then the entire previous body from (2,3) to (4,3) remains, but shifted.\n> \n> Previous: [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n> \n> After head moves to (1,3) and eats food: new head (1,3), then the first body segment is the old head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). So now snake has 10 segments, positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Tail is still at (4,3).\n> \n> Head direction: since I moved left, new head direction is L (left).\n> \n> Now, for turn 40, I need to move from (1,3).\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> - Up: to (1,4). Is it free? (1,4): not border, not obstacle (obstacles: (6,4) etc., (1,4) not listed), and not occupied by body? Body positions: (2,3), (2,2), etc., (1,4) not in list, so should be free.\n> \n> - Down: to (1,2). But (1,2) is an internal obstacle! From the list: (1,2) is an obstacle. So cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,3). But x=0 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,3). (2,3) is occupied by the first body segment. After the move, (2,3) is body, not tail (tail is (4,3)), so moving right to (2,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Current positions: head (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), ..., (4,3)\n> \n> If I move right to (2,3), which is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3), only possible move is Up to (1,4).\n> \n> Down is obstacle, left is wall, right is body, so only Up.\n> \n> So for turn 40, move Up to (1,4).\n> \n> No food there, so snake moves, tail moves: head to (1,4), then body: (1,3) becomes new body, then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail (4,3) moves away? Let's see.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, body follows, tail moves.\n> \n> Previous positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n> \n> After moving up: head to (1,4), then body segments: first body at (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail was at (4,3), but since no growth, tail moves, so the last segment (4,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the segment that was at (1,3) moves to where the head was? Standard: the head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after move up: new head at (1,4)\n> \n> Then, the body: segment that was at index 1 ( (2,3) ) moves to where head was, which is (1,3)?

It's turn 40, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,3), then body segments: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). Let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (4,3)\n> \n> The snake has 10 segments? Positions list has 10 elements: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]. So head at (1,3), tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which is left. So currently moving left.\n> \n> Food: Only one food item: (4,3,10,1). That means position (4,3), value 1, life span 10. Value is +1, so positive food. Life span 10 means it disappears after 10 turns, including this one, so after turn 50 it will be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> But look at the food position: (4,3). Now, where is the snake? The tail is at (4,3), exactly where the food is. Food is under the tail.\n> \n> Now, the rules say that food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Specifically, for this food at (4,3), which is the tail, it can be eaten if the tail moves away and then the head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let me see where the head is: (1,3). Tail is at (4,3). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (1,3) to (4,3): x differs by 3, y same, so not adjacent. They are three cells apart horizontally.\n> \n> Head at (1,3), tail at (4,3), so not adjacent. Therefore, the Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply here because head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, to eat this food, since it's under the tail, we need the tail to move away, and then the head to move to (4,3). But the head is currently at (1,3), which is far away. We need to move the snake in such a way that eventually the head reaches (4,3) after the tail has moved.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, when the snake moves, the tail will move forward unless it eats food. But here, the food is under the tail, so when the snake moves, if no food is eaten, the tail moves away from (4,3), and the food remains there. Then later, we can have the head go to (4,3) to eat it.\n> \n> But the food has a life span of 10, so it will disappear after turn 50. Current turn 40, so we have 10 turns to eat it, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after 10 turns, on turn 50, it disappears. So from turn 40 to 49, it exists, and can be eaten on any of these turns.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (1,3), moving left. But x=1, and walls at x=0, so moving left to (0,3) would hit the wall, which is deadly. Head direction is L, so if I move left now, to (0,3), but x=0 is wall, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move left. Because it would hit the wall.\n> \n> Current head position (1,3), direction L. Possible moves: I can change direction, but with no instant reverse. Since direction is L, reverse would be R, so I cannot move right immediately? No.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can choose to move U, D, L, R each turn, but cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn? Let's read.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. I think it means that from the current state, when I choose the next move, I cannot choose the opposite direction of the current head direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so opposite is R. Therefore, I cannot move right on this turn? No.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> I think it means that for the immediate next turn, when choosing action, you cannot choose the direction opposite to the current moving direction.\n> \n> So, since current direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn (turn 40).\n> \n> Similarly, I can move U, D, or L, but L is towards wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions for turn 40.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,3)\n> \n> Current direction: L\n> \n> Cannot move opposite, so cannot move R (right).\n> \n> Can move U (up), D (down), or L (left).\n> \n> But moving L to (0,3): x=0 is wall, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Moving U to (1,4): y=4, grid from y=0 to 7, so (1,4) should be empty? But we need to check for body or obstacles.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are walls, so (1,4) is within bounds, x=1 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for (1,4): x=1 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. But internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,4) is not listed, so should be free, but we need to check snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> So (1,3) is head, (2,3) is segment, etc. (1,4) is not occupied by snake, so moving U to (1,4) should be possible, unless there's an obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) is not, so (1,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (1,2): but (1,2) is an internal obstacle! Yes, (1,2) is in the list, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving L to (0,3) is wall.\n> \n> Moving R to (2,3): but (2,3) is occupied by the first body segment. Head moving to a body segment is collision, except for the tail, but (2,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell since tail moves, but only if it's the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for (2,3), it is a body segment, not the tail, so if head moves to (2,3), it collides with body.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (1,3):\n> \n> - U: to (1,4) - possible, no wall, no obstacle, no snake body\n> \n> - D: to (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, so invalid\n> \n> - L: to (0,3) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,3) - occupied by body segment (2,3), which is not tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is U, to (1,4).\n> \n> But I thought I cannot move R because of no instant reverse? Current direction is L, opposite is R, so I cannot move R anyway, but in this case, R is invalid for collision anyway.\n> \n> So for turn 40, only possible action is U.\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Head at (1,3), direction L.\n> \n> Move U: to (1,4)\n> \n> - Not wall: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7\n> \n> - Not obstacle: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (1,4) not listed\n> \n> - Not body: snake positions are all listed, (1,4) not among them\n> \n> So yes, (1,4) is free, so moving U is safe.\n> \n> Other moves are invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 40, I must move U to (1,4).\n> \n> After moving, the snake will have new head at (1,4), and the tail will move from (4,3) to somewhere, but since no food eaten, tail moves forward.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed. So the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Snake grows only when it eats food.\n> \n> Here, no food eaten, so after move, head at (1,4), then segments: (1,3) becomes segment 1, (2,3) segment 2, etc., up to (4,2) becomes the new tail?

So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except the obstacles.\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - Borders: all (x,y) where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So let's list the snake body:\n> \n> Index 0: head (1,4)\n> \n> Index 1: (1,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 7: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 8: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 9: (3,3)\n> \n> Snake length is 10 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so last move was up to (1,4).\n> \n> Now food at (4,3) with value +1, life span 9 turns starting from now, turn 41.

Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves.\n> \n> Also, in the action sequence, it should be like:\n> \n> Turn 41: action\n> \n> Turn 42: action\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> Now, current position: head at (1,4), moving up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move down (D) immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: U, L, R.

Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle! So I cannot move to (2,4) because it's a wall.\n> \n> (2,4) is listed in internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> So (2,4) is a wall, not accessible.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,4), moving R to (2,4) is invalid because it's a wall.\n> \n> Moving U to (1,5): is this valid? (1,5) is within bounds? y=5, x=1. Borders are y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=5 is playable since y=0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable? y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are playable for x=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1, y=5. Is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is one, but (1,5) is not listed, so it should be free, but I need to check if it's occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., no (1,5), so (1,5) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: not border or internal obstacle for (1,5).\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (1,5) is x=1 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (1,5) not there, so free.\n> \n> But when I move, I need to see if I collide with body or wall.\n> \n> Moving to (1,5): is it occupied? Snake is at (1,4), (1,3), etc., not at (1,5). So should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, moving R to (2,4) but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> L to (0,4) is x=0, border wall, cannot.\n> \n> D to (1,3) but (1,3) is the second segment of snake, and since head is moving to it, but (1,3) is occupied by body, so collision? Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is collision unless it is the tail segment.\n> \n> Here, possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (1,5): empty, no collision.\n> \n> - R to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (0,4): wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (1,3): (1,3) is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (3,3), which is index 9. (1,3) is index 1, so not tail, so moving to (1,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move from current position is U to (1,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Head at (1,4), moving U to (1,5).\n> \n> After moving, the snake will move: head to (1,5), then body segments follow: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where? When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After move U: new head position (1,5)\n> \n> Then the body: segment 1 was (1,3), but it will move to the old head position (1,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n> \n> After moving U: head moves to (1,5), so new positions: head (1,5), then the first body segment (index 1) moves to where head was, (1,4), then index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (1,3), and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> But index 1 was at (1,3), after move, it will be at (1,4), which is the old head position.\n> \n> Similarly, index 2 was at (2,3), moves to where index 1 was, (1,3), and so on.\n> \n> The tail (index 9, (3,3)) will move to where index 8 was, which is (3,2)? Positions: index 8 is (3,2)? List:\n> \n> Indices: 0: (1,4), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (3,3)\n> \n> After move U: head to (1,5)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1 (old index 1) to (1,4) — old head pos\n> \n> Segment 2 (old index 2) to where old index 1 was: (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 3 (old index 3) to where old index 2 was: (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 4 (old index 4) to where old index 3 was: (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 5 (old index 5) to where old index 4 was: (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 6 (old index 6) to where old index 5 was: (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 7 (old index 7) to where old index 6 was: (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 8 (old index 8) to where old index 7 was: (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 9 (old index 9) to where old index 8 was: (3,2)\n> \n> Old index 8 was (3,2), so segment 9 moves to (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,2) was occupied by old index 8, which is moving to (4,2)? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position, and so on, with the tail moving to the position of the second-to-last segment.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: moves to old head position (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: moves to old position of segment 1, which is (1,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: moves to old position of segment 2, (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: moves to old position of segment 3, (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: moves to old position of segment 4, (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: moves to old position of segment 5, (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7: moves to old position of segment 6, (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8: moves to old position of segment 7, (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: moves to old position of segment 8, (3,2)\n> \n> Old position of segment 8 was (3,2), so segment 9 moves to (3,2). But (3,2) was occupied by segment 8, which is now moving away, so it's free except for the new position.\n> \n> In terms of collision, when moving, the head moves first to the new cell, then body shifts. So for the new head position, it must not be a wall or a body segment except possibly the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 41, from (1,4), only possible move is U to (1,5), which is empty and not wall.\n> \n> R to (2,4) is wall, L wall, D to (1,3) is body collision.\n> \n> So for turn 41, I must move U to (1,5).\n> \n> Then head direction becomes U.\n> \n> Now, after this move, the snake positions will be: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2) — tail is now (3,2), since segment 9 moved to (3,2).\n> \n> Old tail (3,3) is no longer part of snake; it moved away.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Food is at (4,3) with value +1, life span 9 turns. Since turn 41, it disappears after turn 50, so I have until turn 50 to eat it, but life span decreases each turn, so on turn 41, life span 9, turn 42:8, ..., turn 50:0, so it disappears at the start of turn 51 or after turn 50? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn t when food is present, life span L, on turn t+1, L decreases by 1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it is gone.\n> \n> For food at turn 41 with life span 9, it will be present on turns 41 to 49, and disappear on turn 50 or after turn 49? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so on turn 41, countdown is 9. After turn 41, countdown becomes 8 for turn 42. On turn 42, countdown 8, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if countdown decreases on the turn, after the turn it decreases.\n> \n> Typically, at the start of turn t, food has life span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for turn 41, life span 9, after turn 41, it becomes 8 for turn 42.\n> \n> After turn 42, 7, ..., after turn 49, it becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 50 or on turn 50? After turn 49, when life span decreases to 0, it disappears, so on turn 50, it is not present.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> - On turn t, food is present with life span L.\n> \n> - After the turn (after actions), life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> - If life span becomes 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (4,3) on turn 41: L=9\n> \n> After turn 41, L=8\n> \n> After turn 42, L=7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 49, L=1 -1 =0, so it disappears, not present on turn 50.\n> \n> Therefore, it can be eaten on turns 41 to 49 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, back to the game.

To eat it, the body must move away and the head must move onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,3) has food, and it's occupied by food, but the snake body is at (4,2), below it.\n> \n> To eat the food at (4,3), the snake head needs to move to (4,3) when it's free. But right now, (4,3) has food, so it's not occupied by snake, I think. Food positions are separate; the cell has food, but it might be empty or occupied.\n> \n> The cell (4,3) has food, but it doesn't have a snake segment on it, I assume. Snake positions are given, and (4,3) is not in the snake positions, so it should be empty except for food.\n> \n> Snake positions are: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2). So (4,3) is not listed, so it's free, with food on it.\n> \n> Food is on (4,3), value +1.\n> \n> To eat it, head must move to (4,3). But currently head is at (1,5), so I need to navigate to (4,3).\n> \n> Also, when moving, I need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n> \n> Body collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), so if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> But in general, head cannot touch any body segment except the current tail cell, since after move, tail leaves.\n> \n> Now, life span of food is 8 turns, from turn 42. It disappears after N turns, including current, so if not eaten by turn 49 (since 42 + 7 = 49, and on turn 50 it might be gone? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N=8, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 42, life span 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 42. After turn 42, life span 7; after turn 43, 6; ... after turn 49, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 50 or on turn 50? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn t when it spawns, life span N, after that turn, N-1, and so on, until after turn t+N-1, life span 1, then after turn t+N, it should disappear. But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N turns, from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after N turns, meaning at turn t+N it is no longer there.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - After turn t, life span N-1 (for turn t+1)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t+N-1, life span 1 (for turn t+N-1)\n> \n> - Then after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> In this case, food spawned at some earlier turn, but we know at turn 42, life span is 8, so it has 8 turns left starting from turn 42.\n> \n> So it is available on turns 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49. After turn 49, it disappears, so not on turn 50.\n> \n> Turn 42: life span 8\n> \n> After turn 42: life span 7 for turn 43\n> \n> After turn 43: life span 6 for turn 44\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 48: life span 1 for turn 49\n> \n> After turn 49: life span 0, disappears, not on turn 50.\n> \n> So must be eaten by turn 49.\n> \n> Since we are at turn 42, we have 8 turns to eat it: turns 42 to 49 inclusive?

(1,6) not in that list, so safe? But snake body: snake has segments at (1,4), (1,3), etc., but not (1,6), so (1,6) is empty except possibly food, but no food there, so should be free. Moving to (1,6) might be ok, but let's see the body.\n> \n> After moving, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since we don't eat food, length same.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6), new head position (1,6), then body: (1,5) which was head, now body, then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., and tail (3,2) will be removed?

It's turn 43, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? But let's look at the snake positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]. (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,1), etc. x=1 and y=1 are possible? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 should be playable, similarly y=1 to y=6. But (1,5) has x=1, which is not x=0, so it should be ok. Similarly, (2,1) has y=1, not y=0. So playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved to.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and it's moving right, so direction is R.\n> \n> Food: two pieces.\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 7? The format says (x,y, life_span, value)? It says: (4, 3, 7, 1) – I think this means (x,y) = (4,3), life_span=7, value=1. Similarly, (6,3,10,1) – (x,y)=(6,3), life_span=10, value=1.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake length: positions have 10 segments, so length 10.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction right, so moving to the east.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R (continue right), or U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L.

Direction: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume. Standard coordinates: (x,y) with U increasing y, D decreasing y, L decreasing x, R increasing x.\n> \n> So (4,3) is one cell above (4,2). (4,2) is the tail? Snake positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) – so (4,2) is the tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is directly above the tail at (4,2).\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3.\n> \n> Life spans: for (4,3), life_span=7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn. So at turn 43, if not eaten, it will be there for 7 more turns? Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t+L-1, I think? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, then t+1, L-1, ..., down to 0, and when countdown=0, it disappears before the turn? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, meaning it will disappear after L more turns. So it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, and disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> For (4,3), life_span=7 at turn 43, so it can be eaten from turn 43 to 49, and disappears at turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life_span=10, so can be eaten from turn 43 to 52, disappears at turn 53.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from here: U, D, R.\n> \n> If move R: to (3,5)\n> \n> If U: to (2,6)\n> \n> If D: to (2,4)\n> \n> But (2,4) is an obstacle?

It's turn 44. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake is 10 units long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,5) from previous position.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 44, food at (4,3) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 more turns, so by turn 50. Similarly, (6,3) disappears after 9 turns, by turn 53.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for more if possible. But the sequence should start from turn 44.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction R. Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left immediately. So possible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid to visualize. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (6,3)\n> \n> I should find a path to eat food while avoiding collisions and considering long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see what cells are safe to move to from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,6) — is this valid? y=6, not 7, so not wall. Check if it's occupied: snake positions: (3,5) is head, (2,5) is next, but (3,6) not in positions, and not a wall. Walls: borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (3,6) is x=3,y=6, which is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — not (3,6). So (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Down (D): (3,4) — similarly, not border, not in obstacles, not in snake? Snake: (3,5) head, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), etc. (3,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Right (R): (4,5) — not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions. Snake has (4,1) but that's different y. So free.\n> \n> So all three moves are possible from (3,5): U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food. Food at (4,3) and (6,3). (4,3) is close, but below. From (3,5), moving down to (3,4) gets closer to (4,3)? (3,4) to (4,3) is diagonal, but I can only move orthogonally.\n> \n> From (3,5), if I move down to (3,4), then from there I can move right to (4,4) or down to (3,3), etc. (4,3) is at (4,3), so from (3,4) I can go to (4,4) or (3,3) or (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> List obstacles clearly:\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So (2,4) is a wall, so I cannot move to (2,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is wall, but snake body is there? Snake has (1,3), (1,4), etc., but (1,2) is wall, so snake cannot be there, positions are given, so (1,2) is wall, snake is at (1,3), (1,4), etc., which are different cells.\n> \n> (1,2) is wall, so cell (1,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, back to moving to food.\n> \n> Food at (4,3): from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can go down to (3,3) or right to (4,4), but to reach (4,3), from (3,4) I need to go down-right or something, but moves are orthogonal.\n> \n> From (3,4), I can move right to (4,4), then down to (4,3)? (4,4) to (4,3) is down.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food, so if head moves to (4,3) when it's free, it eats.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,3), which is farther.\n> \n> Life span: (4,3) has life span 6, so it will disappear at turn 50 (44+6=50, but since it decreases including current, at turn 44, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, so disappears after turn 49? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span N, it will disappear at turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears. So when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? The rule doesn't specify, but since it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", I think:\n> \n> At the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, then during turn t, it is present, and at the end of turn t, life_span decreases to L-1. When life_span reaches 0, after decreasing, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span N:\n> \n> - Present on turns: t, t+1, ..., t+N-1\n> \n> - Disappears after turn t+N-1, so not present on turn t+N.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, it is present for this turn. After this turn, life_span becomes N-1. When life_span is 1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,3) at turn 44, life_span 6: it will be present for turns 44,45,46,47,48,49. Disappears after turn 49, so not on turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life_span 9: present for turns 44 to 52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves to eat one or both if possible, but prioritize survival.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: head (3,5), tail is (4,1). When snake moves, tail moves, but food can be under body only if body moves away.\n> \n> Currently, is any food under snake body? Food positions: (4,3) and (6,3). Snake body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (4,3) is not occupied by snake, (6,3) not occupied. (1,3) is snake body, but no food there. So no food under snake currently.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - D to (3,4)\n> \n> - R to (4,5)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's find a path to (4,3). (4,3) is at y=3, x=4. Current head at (3,5). So I need to go down and right.\n> \n> If I go down to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3) or right to (4,4), or left to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot. Or up, but up is back to (3,5), which is body now? After moving to (3,4), the snake body: head at (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, so (3,5) is body, so moving back to (3,5) would collide, but I can't move up from (3,4) because (3,5) is now body, but since tail moves, I need to see the position after move.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> At turn 44, snake positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ]\n> \n> After move, say to (3,4), then new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), and tail (4,1) is gone?

It's turn 45. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders that are walls. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). So the snake is 10 segments long.

Let me clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 45, life span 5, it will be there for turns 45,46,47,48,49, and disappear before turn 50. Similarly, (6,3) with life span 8 will be there for turns 45 to 52, disappear before turn 53.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a mental grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm: \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So yes, the outer layer is walls, so the snake can only occupy cells where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so from (3,4), moving down would be to (3,3), but let's see what's there.\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) but that's the body, so collision if I move there. Snake positions: head (3,4), next is (3,5), so (3,5) is the first body segment. Moving up to (3,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - Down: (3,3) – is this free? Current positions: (3,4) is head, (3,5) is body, then (2,5), etc. (3,3) is not in the list, so it might be free, but I need to check for walls or obstacles.\n> \n> (3,3): x=3,y=3. Walls: borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 1-6,1-6. Internal obstacles: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) – none at (3,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – looking at positions, (2,4) is not directly listed; snake has (3,4) head, then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). So (2,4) is not occupied? Positions: from head: (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), so (2,5) is the segment after head. What about (2,4)? It's not in the list, so it should be empty. But let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So (2,4) is not occupied, similarly (3,3) not occupied, (4,4) not, etc.\n> \n> Left from (3,4) is (2,4). (2,4) is not in snake positions, not a wall (x=2,y=4, borders 1-6 ok), internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – oh, (2,4) is an obstacle! I missed that.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (2,4).

Positions: (1,3), (2,3), but not (3,3). (3,3) not listed, so not occupied. Walls: not border. Obstacles: internal obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) – no (3,3), so (3,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) – check: not in snake positions, not border, obstacles: no (4,4), so should be free.\n> \n> So only two possible moves: Down to (3,3) or Right to (4,4).\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down), so if I move down, that's same direction, fine. If I move right, that's perpendicular, also fine. Cannot move up or left as invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.

Head at (3,4), (4,3) is right and down? x from 3 to 4 is right, y from 4 to 3 is down, so it's diagonally, but I can only move orthogonally.\n> \n> From (3,4), to reach (4,3), I need to move right to (4,4) first, then down to (4,3), or down to (3,3) then right to (4,3), etc.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is further right.\n> \n> Also, life span: (4,3) has life 5, so after 5 turns it disappears. Since current turn 45, it will be there until turn 49 inclusive? Life span decreases each turn, including current. At turn t, life span N, it exists for this turn and will disappear after N more turns? Let's read: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life span is N, at each turn, after the turn, life span decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if life span is N at turn t, it is present on turn t, and will be present for N-1 more turns, disappearing before turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, life span 5 at turn 45: on turn 45, life span 5; after turn 45, it decreases to 4; on turn 46, life span 4; ... on turn 49, life span 1; after turn 49, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3), life span 8: present from turn 45 to 52, disappears before turn 53.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), moving.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, immediate move: I can go down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n> \n> If I go down to (3,3), what is there? Not food, I think. Food is at (4,3) and (6,3), not (3,3).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can move to (3,2), (4,3), (2,3), but (2,3) is body? Let's see.\n> \n> After moving down, snake will move: head to (3,3), then body follows: the tail was at (3,1), but when head moves to (3,3), the segment at (3,5) moves to (3,4), and so on. But positions shift.\n> \n> Better to simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> After move down to (3,3): new head at (3,3), then the body: first segment was (3,5) but it moves to where head was, (3,4), then (2,5) moves to (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving down to (3,3):\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment (which was at (3,5)) moves to the old head position (3,4)\n> \n> - Second body segment (was at (2,5)) moves to where first body was (3,5)\n> \n> - Third (was at (1,5)) moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - Fourth (was at (1,4)) moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - Fifth (was at (1,3)) moves to (1,4)\n> \n> - Sixth (was at (2,3)) moves to (1,3)\n> \n> - Seventh (was at (2,2)) moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - Eighth (was at (2,1)) moves to (2,2)\n> \n> - Ninth (was at (3,1)) moves to (2,1)\n> \n> - And tail was (3,1), but it moves to (2,1), so the new tail is at (2,1)? Let's list new positions:\n> \n> New snake: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)\n> \n> Positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) - but that's now occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) - check if free: not in positions, not wall, obstacles: (5,1) but not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) - but (2,3) is in positions, body segment, so collision.\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) - (4,3) is food! And it's not occupied now? After move, positions have (1,3), (2,3), but not (4,3).

No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so length increases.\n> \n> After move to food: head moves to (4,3), which has food, so it eats, and the snake grows. The body moves: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move, positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]\n> \n> Head at (3,3), moving to (4,3).\n> \n> New head at (4,3).\n> \n> Then the first body segment (was at (3,4)) moves to old head position (3,3)?

Positions: after head moves, the first body segment moves to the position head was at.\n> \n> So after head moves to (4,3), the position (3,3) is now empty, and the segment at (3,4) moves to (3,3).\n> \n> Then segment at (3,5) moves to (3,4)\n> \n> Segment at (2,5) moves to (3,5)\n> \n> And so on, down to segment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)? Let's list:\n> \n> - Head was (3,3) -> moves to (4,3) new head\n> \n> - Body segment 1: was (3,4) -> moves to (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: was (3,5) -> moves to (3,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: was (2,5) -> moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: was (1,5) -> moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: was (1,4) -> moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: was (1,3) -> moves to (1,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: was (2,3) -> moves to (1,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: was (2,2) -> moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 9: was (2,1) -> moves to (2,2)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail was (2,1), new segment at (2,1), but (2,1) is where body segment 9 was, and it moved to (2,2), so the position (2,1) is now empty, and new segment added there? No.\n> \n> When food eaten, the tail does not move, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In this case, before the move, the tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> After the head moves and body shifts, the tail segment moves to the position of the previous tail segment? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when the head eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments follow as usual, but the tail does not advance; it stays in place, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) ] with head at (3,3), tail at (2,1)\n> \n> Head moves to (4,3) and eats food.\n> \n> Then, the body segments shift: segment at (3,4) moves to (3,3), segment at (3,5) moves to (3,4), ..., segment at (2,1) would normally move to where the previous segment was, but since food eaten, it does not move; it stays at (2,1), and a new segment is added at (2,1), but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> The segment that was at (2,1) is the tail. When food eaten, the tail does not move, so it remains at (2,1), and the new segment is added at the same position, but that would mean two segments at (2,1), which is wrong.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the head eats food, the snake grows by not removing the tail segment that turn. So, after the head moves to the new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, but the tail segment stays, so the length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after head moves to (4,3), the first body segment moves from (3,4) to the old head position (3,3), second body from (3,5) to (3,4), and so on, down to the second-to-last segment moves to the position of the third-to-last or something.\n> \n> Let's index the segments.\n> \n> Denote positions before move: S0 = head (3,3), S1 = (3,4), S2 = (3,5), S3 = (2,5), S4 = (1,5), S5 = (1,4), S6 = (1,3), S7 = (2,3), S8 = (2,2), S9 = tail (2,1)\n> \n> After head moves to new position (4,3), S0 new is (4,3)\n> \n> Then S1 moves to old S0 position (3,3)\n> \n> S2 moves to old S1 position (3,4)\n> \n> S3 moves to old S2 position (3,5)\n> \n> S4 moves to old S3 position (2,5)\n> \n> S5 moves to old S4 position (1,5)\n> \n> S6 moves to old S5 position (1,4)\n> \n> S7 moves to old S6 position (1,3)\n> \n> S8 moves to old S7 position (2,3)\n> \n> S9 (tail) would move to old S8 position (2,2), but since food eaten, S9 does not move; it stays at (2,1), and a new segment is added at the position where S9 was, so new S10 at (2,1)\n> \n> Thus new positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (2,1) with new segment, so (2,1) is still there, but it's the new tail.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]\n> \n> Length 11.\n> \n> Now, back to the choice.\n> \n> At turn 45, if I move down to (3,3), then at turn 46, I can move right to (4,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> (4,3) has life span 5, at turn 45, so on turn 46 it will have life span 4?

Since life span decreases every turn including current, on turn 46, it has 4 turns left, so it disappears after turn 49? Life span is given as 4, and it decreases each turn, so at turn 46, it has 4 turns before disappearing. After turn 46, it will have 3 left, then 2, then 1, then gone on turn 50? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if life span is 4 at turn 46, after turn 46 (current turn), it has 3 turns left; after turn 47, 2 left; after turn 48, 1 left; after turn 49, it disappears, so not available on turn 50.

So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout to identify safe and dangerous cells.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

List all occupied: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1). So (4,5) is empty, and not wall.

Typically, the new segment is added at the tail end, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions are: (4,3) head, then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) and then a new segment at (2,1)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a food cell, the snake grows by one segment.

No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new positions [new_head, H, B1] and T position empty.\n> \n> After moving to food: new positions [new_head (food), H, B1, B2] and T position still has the new segment, but since T was there, now it's extended.\n> \n> Specifically: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments shift: the segment that was head becomes body, etc., but the tail segment does not advance; instead, it stays in place, and a new segment is added there, so the tail position remains occupied.\n> \n> In terms of list: if positions are P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk (head to tail).\n> \n> After move without eat: new positions Q0 = move(P0), Q1 = P0, Q2 = P1, ..., Qk = P_{k-1}, so tail Pk vacated.\n> \n> With eat: Q0 = move(P0) to food, then Q1 = P0, Q2 = P1, ..., Qk = P_{k-1}, and Q_{k+1} = Pk (new tail at old tail position), so the cell Pk remains occupied.\n> \n> In this case, for us, if I move down to (4,3), eat food, new head (4,3), then body: old head (4,4) now first body, then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail was (2,1), so new tail is at (2,1), and since we ate, we add a new segment at (2,1), so the tail stays at (2,1) for now.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (4,3), then segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), and (2,1) as tail.

Head direction is D (down), meaning it was moving down to (4,3) from (4,4)? Let's see the positions: the head is at (4,3), and the next segment is (4,4). Since head direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (4,3), so from (4,4) to (4,3) is down, which is decreasing y, so direction D is correct.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive), and (5,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive).

No, when head moves to (5,2), the segment that was at (4,2) is now the first body segment at (4,2), but since head moved, the body shifts: the new head is (5,2), then the previous head (4,2) is now the neck, and each segment moves to the previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> Standard snake: after moving, the head is at the new position, and each body segment occupies the position that was occupied by the previous segment before the move. So the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> Before turn 48 move: positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3), 9: (2,3), 10: tail (2,2)\n> \n> After move R to (5,2): new head at (5,2), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,2), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,3), ..., segment 10 moves to where segment 9 was, (2,3), and the previous tail position (2,2) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — tail is now (2,3), and (2,2) is free.\n> \n> On turn 49, from (5,2) move U to (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is free and has no food.\n> \n> After move: head to (5,3), body: (5,2) (which was head), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to segment that was tail (2,3) moves to where previous segment was.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> After move U to (5,3): new head (5,3), then (5,2) (previous head), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail is now (1,3), and (2,3) vacated.\n> \n> On turn 50, from (5,3) move R to (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> After move: head to (6,3), and since ate, a new segment is added, so the tail does not move; instead, the body segments remain, and new tail added at previous tail position.\n> \n> So positions: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, and so on, down to tail (1,3) stays, and since ate, a new segment is added at the position where tail was before move, which was (1,3), but (1,3) is already part of body?

It's turn 51, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). These are walls I must avoid.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake has 11 segments. The head direction is U, which means it's moving upwards, so from (5,4) to (5,5) or something, but let's confirm the movement.\n> \n> Head direction U means last move was up, so from (5,3) to (5,4) I assume, since positions are head first. Positions: index 0 is head: (5,4), then body: (5,3), (5,2), etc. Since head direction is U, it was moving up to reach (5,4), so previous head was (5,3) I think. But for movement, I need to decide the next move based on current head and direction.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 51, (6,3) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, so after turn 53 it's gone. Similarly, (5,5) disappears after turn 56, and (3,6) after turn 59.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so I can't go there. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to see where the body is.\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Body: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Tail is (1,4)\n> \n> Since head is at (5,4) and direction U, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse.

Cannot D.\n> \n> Now, what are the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,3) but this is the body segment, and I cannot move down because of no reverse, so D is invalid anyway.\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,4) is a body segment? Snake positions: (4,4) is the 6th segment? Let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,4) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,2)\n> \n> 3: (4,2)\n> \n> 4: (4,3)\n> \n> 5: (4,4)\n> \n> 6: (3,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,5)\n> \n> 8: (2,5)\n> \n> 9: (1,5)\n> \n> 10: (1,4) tail\n> \n> So (4,4) is position 5, which is a body segment, not the head.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells to head (5,4):\n> \n> - North: (5,5) - what is here? Not occupied by snake or wall? Let's see.\n> \n> (5,5) is not in snake positions, and not a wall. Walls are borders and internal: (6,4) is wall, but (5,5) is not listed as wall. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) should be free unless it's food or something.\n> \n> Food: (5,5) is a food position with value 1 and life 5.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is food, (3,6) is food.\n> \n> But for movement to (5,5), it's a possible cell.\n> \n> - South: (5,3) - this is the body segment at index 1, so it's occupied by snake body. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - West: (4,4) - this is body segment at index 5, occupied, cannot move.\n> \n> - East: (6,4) - this is an internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,4), with head dir U, possible moves are only U to (5,5), because L to (4,4) is body, R to (6,4) is wall, D to (5,3) is body and also reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> D is invalid because reverse and body, L is body, R is wall, so only U is possible.\n> \n> Is that right? (5,5) is food, and it's empty except for the food, but since food can be eaten when head moves there.\n> \n> But let's confirm: (5,5) is not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). No (5,5), so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, no other cells around.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (5,5).\n> \n> But the problem is to think multiple turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> At turn 51, I must move to (5,5), as it's the only option.\n> \n> Then at turn 52, head will be at (5,5), and since I moved U, head direction will be U.\n> \n> Now, snake will grow because I ate food? (5,5) is food, value 1, positive, so when I move to (5,5), I eat the food, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> So after eating, the snake will have a new head at (5,5), and the tail doesn't move yet? No, in Snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, so the head moves to the cell, and since you ate, a new segment is added, but the tail stays in place for that turn? I need to recall the movement.\n> \n> Typically in Snake: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and if it's food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added. If no food, the tail moves forward, so length stays the same.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to a food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, meaning the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, tail moves.\n> \n> Also, positions: the new head position, and body follows.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 51, head moves to (5,5), which is food, so:\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: the previous head becomes part of body, so the positions should be: new head (5,5), then previous body: (5,4), (5,3), etc., but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so the tail (1,4) stays.\n> \n> Current positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> After move U to (5,5) and eat:\n> \n> New positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail (1,4) stays because we ate, so length increases to 12 segments.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (5,5) new head\n> \n> Then index 1: (5,4) previous head\n> \n> Index 2: (5,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to index 10: (1,5) and now index 11: (1,4), since tail didn't move.\n> \n> Current positions have 11 segments, after eating, 12 segments.\n> \n> Now, at turn 52, head at (5,5), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6)\n> \n> - D: (5,4) but this is the body segment (index 1), and moving down would be reverse, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,5)\n> \n> - R: (6,5)\n> \n> Now, what are these cells?\n> \n> (5,6): y=6, within bounds, not border wall. Is it occupied? Snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), etc. No (5,6). Walls: internal obstacles don't include (5,6), so free? But there might be food, but not listed, so empty or food?

D to (5,4) is body and reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So three choices.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food available: (6,3) at (6,3) with life span 2, so at turn 51, life 2, after turn 51, it decreases, so at turn 52, life span 1, then at turn 53, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life 8 at turn 51, so lasts until turn 59.\n> \n> But (6,3) must be eaten by turn 52 or it's gone, since after turn 52, life 1, it can be eaten on turn 52, but on turn 53 it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 52.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current? From the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Let's see: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn 51, food at (6,3) has life_span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns from now, so after turn 53 it's gone.

Subsequent moves prioritize navigating toward the high-value food at (3,6) while avoiding body collisions and walls, with L at turn 52 positioning the snake for efficient access to (3,6) by turn 54. The sequence ensures long-term survival by steering away from the risky right side (near obstacles) and into open space after eating.\n",

It's turn 52, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, and y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – these are also walls, I assume, since they're listed under \"Cells occupied by walls\".\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning up.

But (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (5,3), which is the third segment. Food at (5,3) has life span 10, so it might be under the body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.

Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=5, y=6.\n> \n> Check if (5,6) is occupied by wall or snake body.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,6) is not in internal obstacles, and not border wall since x=5 between 1-6, y=6 between 1-6? y=6 is not y=7, so it should be ok.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall. Similarly, x=7 wall, x=6 not wall.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5, y=6, which is within 1-6, so ok.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4).

When I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail follows, so the last segment is removed, and new segment added at head, so snake grows only when eating food.\n> \n> Without eating, when moving, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> Specifically, when I move without eating, the snake moves to a new head position, and the tail position is removed, so that cell becomes empty.\n> \n> When I eat food, the tail doesn't move; new segment added, so length increases.\n> \n> For (5,3), it is currently occupied by the body. When the snake moves, if I don't eat, the tail will move, so eventually (5,3) might be freed when the tail passes through, but not necessarily immediately.\n> \n> The snake body is a sequence. Positions: let's index them.\n> \n> Head: index 0: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 1: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,3)  <-- food here\n> \n> Index 3: (5,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 7: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 8: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 9: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 10: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 11: (1,4)  <-- tail\n> \n> When I move, if I don't eat food, the head moves to a new position, say new_head, then the body segments shift: segment 1 becomes the old head position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So, after move, new positions: head at new_pos, then segment 1 at old head (5,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 (5,4), ..., segment 11 at old segment 10 (1,5), and tail old segment 11 (1,4) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (1,4) is freed.\n> \n> The food at (5,3) is under segment 2. After a move, segment 2 will move to (5,4) or something, depending on move.\n> \n> But (5,3) itself may not be freed until the tail passes over it, but since the snake is long, it might take time.\n> \n> Specifically, to free (5,3), which is currently occupied by segment 2, it needs to be vacated when the snake moves away and the tail leaves it.\n> \n> But since the snake is connected, (5,3) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves, but when it moves, it goes to the next position, so the cell (5,3) is only freed when the tail end passes through it, meaning when the segment at (5,3) is the last segment before tail, and then when tail moves, it's freed.\n> \n> Let's think: the cell is occupied as long as a segment is on it. When the segment moves off, it becomes free.\n> \n> For example, if I move, and segment 2 moves to the position of segment 1, which is (5,4), so (5,3) is no longer occupied by segment 2; instead, segment 2 is now at (5,4), and (5,3) is empty, unless another segment moves there, but since segments shift, the new segment 3 will be at old segment 2 position, which is (5,3)?

The tail is at (1,4), which is seg11.\n> \n> The distance from seg2 to tail is many segments. When the snake moves, the position of each segment changes only if the head moves in a way that affects it.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the body segments will shift, and eventually, the tail will reach (5,3) if the snake stays, but it might not.\n> \n> To free (5,3), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (5,3) is no longer there, which happens when that segment is the tail and it moves off, or when the snake moves away and the tail follows.\n> \n> But in this case, since (5,3) is near the head, it will take many moves for the tail to reach it, as the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Specifically, (5,3) is seg2, tail is seg11, so there are 10 segments after it, so it will take at least 10 moves for the tail to reach the current position of seg2, but since the head is moving, it may not be at (5,3) when tail comes.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be occupied until the last segment that was on it moves off.\n> \n> Since the segments are moving, (5,3) will be freed when the segment that is on it moves and no other segment moves to it immediately, but in snake, when the head moves, the body shifts, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is freed, and other cells remain occupied.\n> \n> Only the tail position is freed when not eating; other positions remain occupied by the shifted body.\n> \n> In this case, to free (5,3), I need the segment that is currently on (5,3) to be the last segment before the tail, so that when the tail moves, (5,3) is freed.\n> \n> Currently, seg2 is at (5,3), and there are many segments after it. So I need to \"shorten\" the snake or move in a way that seg2 becomes the tail.\n> \n> But the only way to shorten is to not eat food, but when I not eat, the tail moves, but the body shifts, so the relative position doesn't change; seg2 will always be there until I eat or something.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is currently occupied. It will be freed when the snake moves and the tail leaves it, but the tail is not on it now. The tail is on (1,4).\n> \n> The position (5,3) will be occupied as long as a body segment is on it. When the segment on it moves to another position, and no new segment comes, it is freed. But in snake, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so for example, if seg2 moves to seg1's position, which is (5,4), then (5,3) is left, but then seg3 moves to old seg2 position (5,3), so (5,3) is now occupied by seg3. So it remains occupied.\n> \n> The only cell that changes is the tail position; when the tail moves off, that cell is freed. Other cells may be reoccupied by different segments, but the cell itself is only freed when the tail leaves it.\n> \n> Therefore, for (5,3) to be freed, it needs to be the tail position at some point.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,4). I need to move the snake so that (5,3) becomes the tail position.\n> \n> That means I need to have the head move away, and the body follow, so that eventually the segment that was at (5,3) becomes the tail.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, it will take many moves, and I have to avoid eating food to keep the length the same or reduce, but I can't reduce length; only by not eating.\n> \n> If I don't eat, the length stays the same, and the tail moves.\n> \n> The number of moves for a particular cell to become the tail depends on how the snake moves.\n> \n> But roughly, since (5,3) is the 3rd segment from head, and there are 9 segments after it (seg3 to seg11, 9 segments), it will take at least 9 moves for that segment to become the tail, if the snake moves in a straight line, but it may not.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head away, the body will follow, and after 9 moves, the current seg2 will be the new tail, and when I move again, (5,3) will be freed if it's still there, but the position may change.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since the life span of (5,3) is 10, it has plenty of time, so I can ignore it for a few turns and focus on other food.\n> \n> There is food at (3,6), life span 7, so available for 7 turns.\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3,y=6.\n> \n> From head at (5,5), how to get to (3,6).\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, for turn 52, I need to move.\n> \n> Options: U, L, R.\n> \n> Move U to (5,6): (5,6) is within bounds, no wall, no body.

From (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), then L to (3,6), but need to check if possible.\n> \n> Move L to (4,5): from (4,5), then I can go U to (4,6), then L to (3,6).\n> \n> Move R to (6,5): from (6,5), then to (3,6) is farther.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Another thing: the tail reward danger.

Tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> Food: (3,6) and (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is part of the snake body; it's the fourth segment. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So (5,3) has food, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten immediately. The body needs to move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is not occupied by snake; let's check if it's free.\n> \n> (3,6): is this a valid cell? x=3, y=6, between 0 and 7, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (3,6) is free and has food.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,6), direction Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but since direction is Up, I can't move Down immediately because of no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (5,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,7), but y=7 is a wall, so invalid. Cannot go there.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,5), but (5,5) is the second segment of the snake. But (5,5) is the body, and it's adjacent to head? Head is at (5,6), moving down to (5,5). (5,5) is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, moving into it would cause collision because the body segment won't move away immediately. Only the tail cell can be moved into because when the snake moves, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (1,5). So (5,5) is a body segment, and if I move to (5,5), it would be a collision because the head is touching the body before the tail moves.\n> \n> Let me read the collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to (5,5) would collide with body segment, since (5,5) is not the tail. Tail is at (1,5), far away.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Down to (5,5) is invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,6). Is (4,6) free? Let's see: snake positions: head (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), etc. (4,6) not listed, so should be free? Snake positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5). So (4,6) is not occupied by snake. Also not a wall or obstacle. Walls are borders and internals: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,6) is x=4,y=6, not in obstacles. Borders: y=6 is not border, borders are y=0 and y=7, x=0,x=7. So (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,6). (6,6): x=6,y=6. Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,6) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But (6,4) is an obstacle, but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6) are: Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6). Up to (5,7) is wall, Down to (5,5) is body collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move Down because of no instant reverse? Direction is U, so moving D is opposite, so not allowed anyway. But even if it were allowed, it's invalid due to collision.\n> \n> So only L or R are possible.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,6) and (5,3).\n> \n> (3,6) is at (3,6), which is adjacent to (4,6) if I move Left.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), which is occupied by snake body, so not accessible immediately.\n> \n> Life span: (3,6) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn. So from turn 53, it will be gone by turn 60? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 53, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so on turn 53+L, it's gone.\n> \n> For (3,6): life_span=7, so if not eaten by turn 59, it disappears? Turn 53: life_span 7, so countdown: 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0. After 7 decreases, on turn 60 it should be gone? Let's think.\n> \n> Turn 53: life_span=7, so it decreases to 6 on turn 54, to 5 on 55, ..., to 0 on turn 60. When it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns where life_span >0, so up to turn 59 (life_span=1 on turn 59, eaten then, disappears after).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life_span=9, decreases to 8 on turn 54, etc., up to turn 61 (on turn 61, life_span=1 if not eaten, disappears after).\n> \n> But (5,3) is under snake body, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 53.\n> \n> I can go Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n> \n> If I go to (4,6), I'm closer to food at (3,6). (4,6) to (3,6) is adjacent, left.\n> \n> But I need to think about the path and risks.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,3), but it's blocked now.\n> \n> Snake direction: after moving, the direction will change.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, but after move, it will be the new direction.\n> \n> For no instant reverse, it applies to the next move based on current direction.\n> \n> At turn 53, direction is U, so I cannot move D.\n> \n> After I move, say to (4,6) via L, then new head position (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> Then on next turn, I cannot move R, because that would be opposite to L.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (6,6), direction R, cannot move L next.\n> \n> Now, let's consider both options.\n> \n> First option: Move Left to (4,6) on turn 53.\n> \n> Then position: head at (4,6), body follows: the tail end will move, so the segment at (1,5) will be removed, and new head at (4,6), so snake becomes [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? Let's list the new positions.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head to tail: index 0: (5,6), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (1,5)\n> \n> After moving Left to (4,6): new head at (4,6). The body segments shift: segment 1 (5,5) becomes new position 1, but since head moved, the body moves: the tail is removed, and each segment moves to the next position, but only if not growing.\n> \n> When no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move to (4,6) without eating, the new snake: head (4,6), then the previous head (5,6) becomes body, so (4,6), (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). Tail was (1,5), which is removed, so the snake has 11 segments now? Original 12 segments, after move without eating, length same, so 12 segments but tail removed.\n> \n> Positions: new head: (4,6)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the old head (5,6)\n> \n> Then old segment 1: (5,5)\n> \n> Old segment 2: (5,4)\n> \n> Old segment 3: (5,3)\n> \n> Old segment 4: (5,2)\n> \n> Old segment 5: (4,2)\n> \n> Old segment 6: (4,3)\n> \n> Old segment 7: (4,4)\n> \n> Old segment 8: (3,4)\n> \n> Old segment 9: (3,5)\n> \n> Old segment 10: (2,5)\n> \n> Old segment 11: (1,5) is removed, so we have 11 segments? No: the list has 12 positions, after move, the new positions are: new head, then old pos 0 to 10, but old pos 0 was head, now it's the neck, etc.\n> \n> Standard: after moving to a new cell without eating, the snake has: new head position, and the body from index 0 to len-2, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So here, old positions: 0:(5,6), 1:(5,5), 2:(5,4), 3:(5,3), 4:(5,2), 5:(4,2), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(3,4), 9:(3,5), 10:(2,5), 11:(1,5)\n> \n> After move to (4,6), no eat: new head: (4,6)\n> \n> Then body: old pos 0: (5,6) now at index 1\n> \n> Old pos 1: (5,5) index 2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to old pos 10: (2,5) index 11\n> \n> Old pos 11: (1,5) removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Length 12, but tail is now (2,5), and (1,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,6) is still there, and at (5,3).\n> \n> (3,6) is adjacent to head at (4,6).

Food at (5,3) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,3) is occupied by the 5th segment (index from head: head 0, then 1:(5,6), 2:(5,5), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,3), so (5,3) is body.\n> \n> Food is there, but to eat it, the body must move away, meaning that segment must no longer be there when head moves to it.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, that segment will move if we don't eat something else.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 54, if I move to (3,6), I eat that food.\n> \n> Then turn 55, etc.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 54:\n> \n> - Move left (L) to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n> \n> - Move down (D) to (4,5)\n> \n> - Move up (U) to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so impossible. Head at (4,6), up to (4,7) is y=7, which is border wall, so invalid move. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right (R) is instant reverse, not allowed since current direction L.\n> \n> So only possible: L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is free? Current snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (5,5), etc. (4,5) not listed, so free. Also, no wall or obstacle there? Walls: borders and internal, (4,5) x=4,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) has food.\n> \n> So choices: go L to eat food at (3,6) or go D to (4,5) to avoid eating for now? But food is positive, so eating is good, but need to consider future.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,6) has life span 6, so after 6 turns, it disappears. Since current turn 54, it will be there until turn 59? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 54, life span 6, meaning after 6 turns it disappears. So it appears on turn when spawned, and lasts N turns.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 6 on turn 54: on turn 54, countdown=6, after turn 54, countdown=5, ..., down to 0, and disappears after turn when countdown=0? Or at turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 54, countdown=6, meaning it has 6 turns left, including turn 54. So after 6 moves, it will be gone. Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span = L, then after L turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, countdown = L-1, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown=1, after turn t+L, countdown=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, but not on turn t+L if we think countdown=0 means gone.\n> \n> In the state, it's given with life_span, so on turn 54, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 54,55,56,57,58,59? Turn 54: countdown=6, after turn 54, countdown=5 (before turn 55), turn 55: countdown=5? I think it's better to think that at the start of turn, countdown is current life span, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But for movement, we decide at the beginning of the turn.\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span S, then after the turn, S decreases by 1, and if S=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,6) at turn 54: S=6, can be eaten on turn 54, then after turn 54, S=5, can be eaten on turn 55, ..., on turn 59, S=1, eaten, after turn 59, S=0, disappears. Turn 60 it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3) at turn 54, S=8, can be eaten from turn 54 to 61, disappears on turn 62.\n> \n> Now back to actions.\n> \n> Option 1: Turn 54 move L to (3,6), eat food. Snake grows to length 13, head at (3,6), direction now L (since moved left).\n> \n> Then positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (2,5).\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves: L, U, D (since direction L, cannot R instant reverse).\n> \n> L to (2,6): is (2,6) free? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle, snake positions: (2,5) is tail, (3,6) head, (3,5) body, (2,6) not occupied, so free? But (2,6) y=6, not wall.\n> \n> U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (3,5): (3,5) is a body segment, current positions have (3,5) as the 11th segment? Let's index: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So (3,5) is occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, so only L to (2,6) is possible? U invalid, D to (3,5) occupied, R not allowed, so only L to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is free, as we said.\n> \n> Move to (2,6), no food there, so snake moves, head to (2,6), tail moves forward, so tail was (2,5), now it moves, but since we didn't eat, tail moves: positions become head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., down to (3,5) becomes the new tail? Original tail (2,5) moves off, and new positions: after moving head to (2,6), the body: previous head (3,6) becomes first body, then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). (3,5) was second last, now last, so tail at (3,5). (2,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Length still 13.\n> \n> Now, at (2,6), possible moves: from direction L (since moved left to here), so can go L, U, D.\n> \n> L to (1,6): x=1,y=6, not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is one, but (1,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> U to (2,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (2,5): (2,5) was just vacated, but now free? After move, (2,5) is empty, and no food mentioned, so free. But (2,5) has no food, so can move there.\n> \n> But let's not get too far; I need to plan sequence.\n> \n> First, if I eat at (3,6) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I must go to (2,6), since only choice.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6), or D to (2,5), or U invalid.\n> \n> (2,5) is free, as above.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is still there, but under body. When can I eat it? The body must move away first.\n> \n> Currently, (5,3) is occupied by a body segment. As snake moves, that segment will move if we don't eat.\n> \n> In the sequence, after eating at (3,6), snake is longer, and (5,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> But over time, as we move, the snake shifts, so eventually that cell might be free.\n> \n> But it has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, option 2 at turn 54: move down to (4,5).\n> \n> Then no eat, so snake moves head to (4,5), tail moves off (2,5), so new positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). Tail was (2,5), moved off, so new tail is (3,5)? Positions: after move, head (4,5), then previous head (4,6) becomes body, then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). (3,5) is now tail, since (2,5) gone. Length 12.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), direction: moved down, so current direction D. Possible moves: D, L, R (cannot U, instant reverse).\n> \n> D to (4,4): (4,4) is body segment? Current positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), etc., and (4,4) is in body, yes, occupied.\n> \n> L to (3,5): (3,5) is tail, but occupied, cannot move to own body.\n> \n> R to (5,5): (5,5) is body segment, occupied.\n> \n> So all possible moves seem blocked? D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5) occupied, R to (5,5) occupied.\n> \n> U is not allowed because current direction D, cannot go U instant reverse.\n> \n> So from (4,5), no valid moves? That can't be right.\n> \n> Positions after moving to (4,5): head at (4,5), body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> Now neighbors of (4,5):\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Left: (3,5) - occupied by body (tail)\n> \n> - Right: (5,5) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) - but (4,6) is the first body segment, occupied.\n> \n> (4,6) is directly above, but occupied.\n> \n> So all adjacent cells are occupied, so indeed, no valid moves from (4,5). Moving to (4,5) would trap the snake immediately on the next turn.\n> \n> Therefore, moving down to (4,5) at turn 54 is suicidal because on turn 55, there are no safe moves; all directions are blocked by body or walls.\n> \n> Walls: (4,4) is not wall, but body, so collision.\n> \n> Thus, moving D to (4,5) is not an option; it leads to certain death.\n> \n> Therefore, the only viable move at turn 54 is to go left to (3,6) and eat the food.\n> \n> Then, as before, on turn 55, I must go to (2,6), since only choice.\n> \n> Now, at (2,6), after turn 55 move.\n> \n> After turn 54: ate at (3,6), head at (3,6), direction L.\n> \n> Turn 55: move L to (2,6), no food, so snake moves, head to (2,6), tail moves off, positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). Tail is now (3,5).\n> \n> Direction: moved left to (2,6), so direction L.\n> \n> Now at (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (1,6): (1,6) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied. Snake has (2,6) head, (3,6), etc., no (1,6). Internal obstacles: (1,2), not (1,6), so free.\n> \n> - U to (2,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (2,5): (2,5) is free? After tail moved, (2,5) is empty, no food, so free.\n> \n> - R to (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by body, and also R is instant reverse? Current direction L, moving right would be opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> So possible: L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the other food at (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) has food with life span 8, now at turn 55, it has S=7 left? Initially turn 54 S=8, after turn 54, S=7, so turn 55 S=7.\n> \n> To eat (5,3), I need to have the head move there when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (5,3) is occupied by body. In the positions, (5,3) is part of the snake.\n> \n> As the snake moves, (5,3) will be vacated when the tail moves past it, but since we ate, the tail is at (3,5), and (5,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> The segment at (5,3) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, if we move, the body shifts, so the cell (5,3) might be free after some moves.\n> \n> But let's see the snake body: positions from head: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is the 7th segment? Index: 0:head (2,6), 1:(3,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(5,6), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,4), 6:(5,3), 7:(5,2), etc.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if we don't eat, head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so the segment at (5,3) will move to where (5,4) was or something? When snake moves, the tail segment is removed, and each body segment moves forward to the next position.\n> \n> Specifically, when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> For example, from above, if we move head from (2,6) to say (1,6), then new positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). Tail was (3,5), removed, so (3,4) is new tail.\n> \n> (5,3) is still occupied, by the segment that was at (5,4) now moved to (5,3)? After move: head to (1,6), then segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,6), segment 2 moves to (3,6), which was segment 1, and so on, down to segment 11 ( (3,4) ) moves to (3,5)? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: seg0: (2,6), seg1: (3,6), seg2: (4,6), seg3: (5,6), seg4: (5,5), seg5: (5,4), seg6: (5,3), seg7: (5,2), seg8: (4,2), seg9: (4,3), seg10: (4,4), seg11: (3,4), seg12: (3,5) — but length 13? Earlier I had 13 positions.\n> \n> In the list: head (2,6), then 11 bodies and tail, so 12 segments? Positions: 13 cells.\n> \n> After turn 54 eat, positions: 13 cells: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] but (2,5) is tail.\n> \n> After turn 55 move to (2,6) no eat: head to (2,6), then body: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). And tail (2,5) removed, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)] — 13 positions, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> (5,3) is still occupied, by the segment that was there.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the cell (5,3) will be vacated only when the segment that is there moves away, which will happen when the tail moves past it, but it's in the middle.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (5,3) will move to (5,4) when the head moves and the body shifts, but (5,4) is occupied, so the cell (5,3) is only vacated when the segment that was at (5,3) moves to another cell, and no new segment comes, which happens when that part of the body moves.\n> \n> For example, if we keep moving, eventually the segment that was at (5,3) will be closer to the tail and move off when tail advances.\n> \n> But it takes time.\n> \n> To eat the food at (5,3), we need to have the head move to (5,3) after the body has moved away from it.\n> \n> Currently, it's occupied, so we need to move in such a way that the snake body leaves (5,3) free.\n> \n> But since the food is under the body, we have to move the snake so that the segment on (5,3) moves, and then later head can come.\n> \n> But with life span 8, it might be possible.\n> \n> But let's first complete the immediate sequence.\n> \n> At turn 55, from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is free, as vacated.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) is adjacent to tail?

Also, not wall, so left to (2,6) should be possible.\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) – but (4,6) is the first body segment, directly behind head. Since head is moving, and tail moves, but when head moves to a cell, if it's body, it collides unless it's the tail and we eat food or something.

Let's see.\n> \n> General rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when moving into the tail cell, because tail will move away.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,6) is not the tail; tail is at (2,5).

Maybe it's the remaining life span, but it says \"value and life span\" separately.\n> \n> Another idea: in the core rules, it says \"Life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn\".\n> \n> In the input, for (5,3,6,1), it might mean x=5,y=3, value=6, life_span=1? But value=6 is inconsistent.\n> \n> Perhaps \"6\" is the value, meaning this food gives 6 points, but the rules say +1 for positive. This is confusing.\n> \n> Let me look at the core rules again: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> And in the state, it's given as (5,3,6,1), so I think value1=6, life_span1=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2,9,1) with value=9, life_span=1.\n> \n> But the rules state that positive food has reward +1, so maybe in this game, food can have different values? The rules don't specify that; it says +1 for positive.\n> \n> Perhaps \"value\" here is not the reward, but something else. But it says \"Value and Life Span\".\n> \n> I think I should proceed with the given values, as per the state. So for (5,3), value=6, life_span=1, meaning it disappears after 1 turn, including current turn? Life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn or next?\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So if life_span is 1, at turn t, it will disappear after this turn, so it's only available for this turn. Countdown decreases including current turn, so if life_span is S at turn t, it will be S-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For a food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L if not eaten.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, the countdown is L. At turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it becomes 0 at turn t+L, and then it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, life_span=1 at turn t: countdown=1, so at turn t it can be eaten, but at turn t+1, countdown=0, so it disappears, so it's only available on turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span=2 at turn t: countdown=2 at t, can be eaten on t and t+1; at t+2, countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3,6,1), at turn 56, life_span=1, so it can only be eaten on turn 56, and will disappear after that.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2,9,1) with life_span=1, only available on turn 56.\n> \n> But the value is 6 and 9, which is strange. Perhaps the \"value\" is the reward points, so eating (5,3) gives +6 points, and (5,2) gives +9 points, but the core rules say +1 for positive food. Maybe this is a variant where food can have different values.\n> \n> The core rules say: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", but it doesn't say it can't have other values. Perhaps for this game, food can have values other than +1.\n> \n> Similarly, negative food would have negative values.\n> \n> But here both have positive values, 6 and 9, so both are positive food.\n> \n> I think I should go with the state as given. So (5,3) is positive food with value 6, life span 1, so only available this turn.\n> \n> (5,2) is positive food with value 9, life span 1, only available this turn.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,6), moving left, so current direction is L.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) and (5,2).\n> \n> But (5,3) and (5,2) are both occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Look at snake positions: (5,3) is segment 6, and (5,2) is segment 7.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (5,1), but (5,1) is not food.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) and (5,2) are under the snake body.\n> \n> According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's find the tail. Snake positions: last one is (3,5), so tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head is at (2,6), which is adjacent to tail? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Head: (2,6)\n> \n> Tail: (3,5)\n> \n> Are they adjacent? (2,6) to (3,5): delta x=1, delta y=1, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so same x or y and |delta|=1.\n> \n> (2,6) and (3,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be (2,6) to (1,6) left, (3,6) right, (2,5) down, (2,7) up, but y=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> (2,6) possible moves: U (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid; D (2,5); L (1,6); R (3,6) but (3,6) is snake body, segment 1.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (2,6), tail at (3,5), distance sqrt(2), not adjacent.\n> \n> So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Now, the food at (5,3) and (5,2) are under the body. To eat them, the body must move away, and head must move there.\n> \n> But they have life span 1, only available this turn, turn 56.\n> \n> So if we don't eat them this turn, they disappear.\n> \n> But to eat (5,3), which is under segment at (5,3), we need that cell to be free when head moves there, but currently it's occupied.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2).\n> \n> Now, the snake is moving, so each turn, the snake moves, tail moves, so cells can be freed.\n> \n> Let's see the current position.\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction L, so if it continues left, it would go to (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is not wall, not obstacle? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) is within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (1,6) is not an obstacle.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., no (1,6), so it's free.\n> \n> But let's think about actions.\n> \n> Current turn t=56, head at (2,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R because no instant reverse. Reverse of L is R, so I cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions: L (left to (1,6)), U (up to (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid), D (down to (2,5)), or since direction is L, moving L is forward, U and D are turns.\n> \n> U: (2,7) is y=7, which is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> D: (2,5) is down, y=5.\n> \n> L: (1,6)\n> \n> R: (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by the first body segment, and also R is reverse, which is not allowed because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is occupied, so even if I could, it's invalid due to collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: (2,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - check if free: (2,5) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4). (2,5) not in that list, so free. Yes.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - free, as above.\n> \n> - R: not allowed and occupied.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L or D.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) and (5,2) with high values 6 and 9, but life span 1, so only this turn. But they are under body, so to eat them, we need to move the snake so that those cells are vacated and head moves there, but this turn, head is at (2,6), far away, so impossible to eat them this turn because head can't reach (5,3) or (5,2) in one move; they are 3 cells away.\n> \n> (2,6) to (5,3): delta x=3, delta y=3, so at least 3 moves away, but we have only this turn for the food, since life span 1, disappears after this turn.\n> \n> So we cannot eat them at all; they will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, we should ignore these food items for eating, as they are inaccessible.\n> \n> Now, we need to think about future moves.\n> \n> But there might be other food, but in the state, only two food items are listed, both with life span 1, so after this turn, no food?

Obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, (3,5) is tail or something, but let's see.\n> \n> First, let's evaluate both choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (1,6) at turn 56.\n> \n> Then at turn 57, from (1,6), only possible move is D to (1,5), since U and L invalid, R not allowed (reverse).\n> \n> After moving to (1,6), new positions: as above, head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), ..., down to (3,4) tail.\n> \n> Now (1,5) is free, not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (1,2), not (1,5)).\n> \n> So move D to (1,5) at turn 57.\n> \n> New head (1,5), direction D.\n> \n> Then at turn 58, from (1,5), direction D, so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall invalid, R to (2,5), U to (1,6) but U is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction D, so U is opposite, cannot move U.\n> \n> L to (0,5) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only D to (1,4) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> (1,4) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied? At this point, snake positions: after turn 57 move, head at (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) tail? Let's list positions after turn 57.\n> \n> After turn 56 move to (1,6):\n> \n> - T56: head to (1,6), so positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)  // 13 segments? After move, since no food, length decreases? No.\n> \n> At turn 56, before move, length 13.\n> \n> After move to (1,6), no food eaten, so tail is removed, new length 12.\n> \n> Positions: head (1,6), then the first 12 segments from old: old head to old pos11, but old positions had 13, after move, new positions: new head at (1,6), then the first 12 body segments from the old head and first 11 body? Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the last position is vacated.\n> \n> So from turn 56 positions: indices 0 to 12.\n> \n> After move, new position 0: (1,6)  // new head\n> \n> New position 1: old pos0 (2,6)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos1 (3,6)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos2 (4,6)\n> \n> New position 4: old pos3 (5,6)\n> \n> New position 5: old pos4 (5,5)\n> \n> New position 6: old pos5 (5,4)\n> \n> New position 7: old pos6 (5,3)\n> \n> New position 8: old pos7 (5,2)\n> \n> New position 9: old pos8 (4,2)\n> \n> New position 10: old pos9 (4,3)\n> \n> New position 11: old pos10 (4,4)\n> \n> New position 12: old pos11 (3,4)  // new tail, old pos12 (3,5) removed.\n> \n> So positions at turn 57 before move: head (1,6), body (2,6) to (3,4), tail (3,4)? New position 12 is (3,4), but position 11 is (4,4), etc.\n> \n> List: cells occupied: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)  // 13 cells? From 0 to 12, that's 13 positions, but we removed the tail, so length should be 12.\n> \n> Mistake: when snake moves without eating, the number of segments decreases by one? No.\n> \n> Initial length L.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, and the tail is removed, so new length L, but the last segment is removed, so the positions are the first L positions of the new path.\n> \n> At turn 56, 13 positions.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell without eating, the new snake has head at new cell, and the body is the first 12 segments of the old snake, so the old tail is gone.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new position, then old head, old body1, ..., up to old body11, so 12 segments.\n> \n> For example, old positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P12\n> \n> After move to new cell Q, new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P11  // 13 segments? Q, then P0 to P11, that's 12 positions after Q? Let's count.\n> \n> Q is new head, then P0 is new body1, P1 new body2, ..., P11 new body12? P0 to P11 is 12 positions, plus Q, so 13 segments, but we removed P12, so length is the same? I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves, if no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed, so the snake shortens by one cell? No, the snake moves forward, so the head is at new position, the tail is left, so the number of segments remains the same, but the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> For example, start with segments A-B-C, head at A.\n> \n> Move head to D, then new segments D-A-B, and C is vacated. Length still 3.\n> \n> Similarly, here, with 13 segments, after moving head to new position, new head at new pos, then old head, old body1, ..., old body11, and old body12 (tail) is vacated. So new positions: new head, old head, old pos1, old pos2, ..., old pos11. That's 12 positions after new head? New head + 11 old positions? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: 0: (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,6), new position 0: (1,6)\n> \n> New position 1: old pos0 (2,6)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos1 (3,6)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos2 (4,6)\n> \n> New position 4: old pos3 (5,6)\n> \n> New position 5: old pos4 (5,5)\n> \n> New position 6: old pos5 (5,4)\n> \n> New position 7: old pos6 (5,3)\n> \n> New position 8: old pos7 (5,2)\n> \n> New position 9: old pos8 (4,2)\n> \n> New position 10: old pos9 (4,3)\n> \n> New position 11: old pos10 (4,4)\n> \n> New position 12: old pos11 (3,4)\n> \n> And old pos12 (3,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: positions from (1,6) to (3,4), with head at (1,6), tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Length 13 still? Positions 0 to 12, that's 13 segments, but we have new position 12 which is old pos11 (3,4), and old pos12 was (3,5) removed, so the snake has 13 segments, but the last one is new.\n> \n> In terms of cells, it occupies 13 cells, same length.\n> \n> I think I have a off-by-one error.\n> \n> Typically, if length L, after move without eating, new length L, head new, body old head to old body L-2, and old tail removed.\n> \n> Here L=13, old positions 0 to 12.\n> \n> New head at Q.\n> \n> New position 0: Q\n> \n> New position 1: old 0\n> \n> New position 2: old 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position 12: old 11\n> \n> So the new positions are Q, old0, old1, ..., old11, which is 13 positions, and old12 is removed.\n> \n> Old11 was (3,4), old12 was (3,5), so new tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, for the other move.\n> \n> Back to turn 57 from (1,6), after moving to (1,6) at turn 56.\n> \n> At turn 57, head at (1,6), direction L (since we moved L, new direction L).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (0,6) wall, invalid; U to (1,7) wall, invalid; D to (1,5) free; R to (2,6) but R is reverse of L, not allowed.\n> \n> So only D to (1,5).\n> \n> Move D to (1,5) at turn 57.\n> \n> New head (1,5), direction D.\n> \n> Now positions after this move: similar, head to (1,5), then old head (1,6), old body1 (2,6), etc., up to new tail which was old pos11 or something.\n> \n> But for simplicity, at turn 58, head at (1,5), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall invalid, R to (2,5), U to (1,6) but U is reverse of D, not allowed.\n> \n> So only D to (1,4) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> (1,4) is free?

The initial move down to (2,5) avoids the top-left corner and positions the snake to move towards the open center-bottom area, which has more space for maneuvering and reduces the risk of trapping the snake.

So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), since x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive, but walls at edges, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are free, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So, these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> **Snake Positions:**\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (3,4)  // tail\n> \n> Counting: from head to tail: positions 0 to 12, so 13 segments. Head at index 0: (2,5), tail at index 12: (3,4).\n> \n> **Snake Head Direction:** Current direction is D (down). That means from the previous move, it was moving down to (2,5). Since direction is given as head direction, it's the direction it's facing now, so moving down means it came from above? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6). (2,6) is above (2,5) because y increases up or down? In grid coordinates, typically y=0 is top or bottom? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might mean y+1 is up or down? The problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so if y increases upwards, then U is up, D is down. But in the positions, head is at (2,5), previous segment at (2,6). If (2,6) is above (2,5), then y=6 has higher y, so y increases upwards. So (2,6) is north of (2,5), meaning the snake was moving south to (2,5). Direction is D, down, which is consistent with moving to (2,5) from (2,6)? From (2,6) to (2,5), that's moving down if y decreases downwards. Clarify:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) — assuming y=0 is bottom, y+1 up; or y=0 top, y+1 down? The problem doesn't specify, but from movement: U (x,y+1) and D (x,y-1). In positions, head at (2,5), body at (2,6). If head is at (2,5) and body at (2,6), that means the snake moved from (2,6) to (2,5), so decreasing y, which is down if y=0 is top. Typically in grids, y=0 is top row, y increases downwards, or y=0 bottom? I need to be consistent.\n> \n> Look at the positions: head (2,5), then (2,6). (2,6) has y=6, which is higher than y=5, so if y increases upwards, (2,6) is above (2,5), so moving from (2,6) to (2,5) is moving down, decreasing y. Direction D is down, which matches. Similarly, U would be to (x,y+1), increasing y, moving up.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. y=0 is bottom or top? Not specified, but since U is (x,y+1), and D is (x,y-1), and borders at y=0 and y=7, it doesn't matter as long as we know the coordinates.\n> \n> For collision, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 to 7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive, similarly y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. y=0 and y=7 walls, y from 1 to 6. So grid is 6x6 cells: (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are blocked.\n> \n> **Food:**\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 5, life span 1? Wait, the format: (x,y, value, life_span) I think.\n> \n> It says: (5, 3, 5, 1) and (5, 2, 8, 1)\n> \n> So first food: position (5,3), value 5, life span 1\n> \n> Second food: position (5,2), value 8, life span 1\n> \n> Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 57, life span 1, after this turn, it will be 0 and disappear? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, when it appears, it lasts for N turns, including the turn it spawns? But here, at turn 57, we have food with life span 1, so after turn 57, it will disappear, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 57, or not at all? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 57, life span is 1, which means after this turn, it will be gone. So it must be eaten on turn 57 to be collected.\n> \n> Similarly for both foods, life span 1, so they must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> But let's confirm: at turn t, if life span is L, after t, it becomes L-1, and when L=0, it disappears. So for L=1, on turn t, if not eaten, after t, it disappears. So only chance to eat is on this turn.\n> \n> But the snake is at (2,5), and foods are at (5,3) and (5,2). Can I reach them this turn? Current head at (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with direction constraint.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down). So I just moved down to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse. Instant reverse would be opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U on this turn, because that would be reversing direction instantly.\n> \n> Allowed moves: since I moved down to here, I can go D (further down), L (left), R (right), but not U.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,5). Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,6) — but (2,6) is occupied by the snake body? Positions: snake has (2,6) as the first body segment. So moving to (2,6) would be colliding with body, unless it's the tail, but it's not the tail; tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), ...] so (2,6) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to (2,6) would cause head to hit body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D: down to (2,4). Is that free? (2,4) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: head (2,5), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). So (2,4) is not listed, so it might be free, but is it a wall or obstacle?\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacles (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an internal obstacle! So (2,4) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving L: left to (1,5). Now, is (1,5) a wall? x=1 is within 1-6, y=5, not border. But internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so should be free. Also, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all x=2,3,4,5, no x=1, so (1,5) should be free.\n> \n> Moving R: right to (3,5). (3,5) is not in snake positions? Snake has (3,6), (3,4), but not (3,5). (3,5) not listed, so free? Also, walls: x=3,y=5, not border, internal obstacles: (2,4) but not (3,5), so free.\n> \n> Moving D: to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> U: to (2,6) but occupied by body, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (2,5) are L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n> \n> But direction constraint: I can move L or R, since not reverse.\n> \n> Now, foods: (5,3) and (5,2), both with value 5 and 8, both life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> But I'm at (2,5), which is far from (5,3) and (5,2). How can I eat them this turn? Impossible, since I can only move one step. So I cannot eat either food this turn; they will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 57, so after turn 57, they disappear, so I cannot eat them on future turns. Only chance is turn 57, but I can't reach them, so both foods will be lost.\n> \n> That means no food to eat this turn, and I need to think about future, but no food is given except these, which expire now.\n> \n> But after they disappear, new food might spawn, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning. I think food spawns are not controlled by me; I have to work with what's given. But in this state, only these two foods are listed, both expiring now.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to survive and wait for new food.\n> \n> But let's confirm the food positions: (5,3) and (5,2). (5,3) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions include (5,3) as segment 7? List: index 7 is (5,3), yes, it's part of the snake body. Similarly, (5,2) is segment 8.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For (5,3), there is food, but it's under the body segment at (5,3). Similarly for (5,2).\n> \n> But to eat it, the body must move away first, meaning that segment is no longer there, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But on this turn, since the body is still there, I cannot eat it immediately. I need to move such that the snake moves and that body segment moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (2,5), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n> \n> Food at (5,3) and (5,2), under body segments.\n> \n> Since life span is 1, after this turn, they disappear, so I cannot eat them at all, because even if I move and the body moves away, it would be on future turns, but food expires after this turn.\n> \n> For example, if I move, on this turn, I go to (1,5) or (3,5), then the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves forward.\n> \n> So segment at (5,3) will move to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if I move left to (1,5), new head: (1,5)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1 (was (2,6)) moves to head old position (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 2 (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n> \n> Segment 3 (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 4 (5,6) moves to (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 5 (5,5) moves to (5,6)?

To eat, the head must move to the food cell.\n> \n> Similarly, segment 9 (4,2) moves to old segment 8 position (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 10 (4,3) moves to old segment 9 position (4,2)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> The food at (5,3) and (5,2) are still under body segments after the move? After move, segment 7 moves to (5,4), segment 8 moves to (5,3), so (5,3) is now occupied by segment 8, so food is still under body.

It's turn 58. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and those specific cells blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,4)\n> \n> So the snake is 13 segments long.

Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,5).

L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check what's around (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) - but (3,6) is a body segment? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> (3,5) is head, then (2,5) is next, which is left of head? (2,5) is x=2,y=5, head at (3,5), so (2,5) is left, but that's the first body segment.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (3,5):\n> \n> - North/Up: (3,6) - is this occupied? From positions: (3,6) is segment 3 in the list? Positions: index 0: (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), yes, (3,6) is segment 3, so it's body. So moving up to (3,6) would be collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> - South/Down: (3,4) - is this free? Let's see if it's wall or body or food.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, (3,4) is x=3,y=4, not border, not in internal obstacles: internal are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is wall, but (3,4) not listed, so not wall.\n> \n> Body: snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (4,4) is segment 12, but (3,4) not in list, so not body.\n> \n> Food: (5,3), (5,2), (2,5) are food, not (3,4).\n> \n> So (3,4) is empty, I think.\n> \n> - East/Right: (4,5) - not in positions? Positions: (4,6) is segment 4, (5,6) segment 5, (5,5) segment 6, (5,4) segment 7, etc. (4,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - West/Left: (2,5) - but (2,5) is segment 1, body, so collision if move left.\n> \n> Also, left is opposite direction? Current direction R, moving left is opposite, but since it's occupied, it's invalid anyway, but even if empty, cannot move opposite.\n> \n> But here it's occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up to (3,6): but (3,6) is body segment, collision, deadly.\n> \n> - Down to (3,4): seems empty.\n> \n> - Right to (4,5): seems empty.\n> \n> - Left to (2,5): body segment and opposite direction, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible: Down or Right.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (5,3), (5,2), (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is also a body segment? (2,5) is segment 1, which is the first body part after head. But it has food on it? Food is at (2,5) with value 1, life 10.\n> \n> Important: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) has food, but (5,3) is segment 8? Positions: segment 8 is (5,3), and there's food there. But since it's under the body, we can't eat it yet; we need to move away and then back.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is segment 9, food there.\n> \n> (2,5) is segment 1, food there.\n> \n> Now, life span: (5,3) life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 58, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 58+4-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life_span L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, countdown L, then t+1, L-1, ..., down to 1 at turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (5,3): life_span=4 at turn 58, so:\n> \n> - Turn 58: countdown=4\n> \n> - Turn 59: countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 60: countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 61: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 62: disappears\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): life_span=7, turn 58, so disappears at turn 58+7=65.\n> \n> (2,5): life_span=10, disappears at turn 58+10=68.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current possible moves: Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5).\n> \n> Let's consider each option.\n> \n> First, move Down to (3,4).\n> \n> Then head moves to (3,4), and the snake body moves: tail moves away, so the segment that was at (4,4) moves? When head moves, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, and a new head is added.\n> \n> After moving down:\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Then the body: previous head (3,5) becomes new segment 1, then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), and the tail was (4,4), which is removed? Positions: after move, the snake shifts: the head moves to new position, and the tail is cut off unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten here, moving to (3,4) which has no food, so snake length same, tail segment (4,4) is removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). (4,3) was segment 11, now it becomes the tail? Original positions: 12 segments after head? List indices.\n> \n> Original: 13 positions: idx 0: (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,4)\n> \n> After moving down to (3,4), no food eaten, so new head (3,4), then the body from idx 0 to 11: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). And (4,4) is gone. So new tail is (4,3).\n> \n> Now, the food at (5,3) is still there, under body? (5,3) is segment 8 in original, which is now segment 9 in new? New positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (4,6), seg6 (5,6), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (5,2), seg11 (4,2), seg12 (4,3). So (5,3) is occupied by seg9, and food is there, but since body is on it, not eaten yet.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is seg10, food there.\n> \n> (2,5) is seg2, food there.\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), possible moves: U (up to (3,5)), but (3,5) is now seg1, body, collision.\n> \n> D (down to (3,3)) - let's see if free.\n> \n> L (left to (2,4)) - (2,4) is a wall? Internal obstacle: (2,4) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> R (right to (4,4)) - (4,4) was tail, now removed, so should be empty? But was it food? No, food not there.\n> \n> (4,4) is empty now.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,4) wall, so left to (2,4) invalid.\n> \n> So from (3,4):\n> \n> - U to (3,5): body, collision.\n> \n> - D to (3,3): not wall, not body? Body: positions have (3,4) head, (3,5) seg1, etc. (3,3) not in positions, walls not, so free.\n> \n> - L to (2,4): wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R to (4,4): empty, free.\n> \n> Also, no direction constraint since we moved down, new direction down?

Food at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5), not (4,5).\n> \n> So no eat, tail (4,4) removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3). Tail is (4,3).\n> \n> Now from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (4,6): (4,6) is body? Positions: seg4 was (4,6), now after move, seg1 is (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (4,6), etc. So (4,6) is seg5, body, collision if move up.\n> \n> D to (4,4): (4,4) was tail, now removed, so empty?

New positions: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (4,6), seg6 (5,6), seg7 (5,5), etc. So (5,5) is seg7, body, collision.\n> \n> So from (4,5), only possible move is down to (4,4)?

Let's trace:\n> \n> After move down:\n> \n> - Head new: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body: segment 1 (was (3,5)) moves to (3,4) — which was head\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was (2,5)) moves to (3,5) — old pos of seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was (2,6)) moves to (2,5) — old pos of seg2\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was (3,6)) moves to (2,6) — old pos of seg3\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was (4,6)) moves to (3,6) — old pos of seg4\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was (5,6)) moves to (4,6) — old pos of seg5\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was (5,5)) moves to (5,6) — old pos of seg6\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was (5,4)) moves to (5,5) — old pos of seg7\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was (5,3)) moves to (5,4) — old pos of seg8\n> \n> - Segment 10 (was (5,2)) moves to (5,3) — old pos of seg9\n> \n> - Segment 11 (was (4,2)) moves to (5,2) — old pos of seg10\n> \n> - Segment 12 (tail, was (4,3)) moves to (4,2) — old pos of seg11\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Tail at (4,2)\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) was under seg9, which moved to (5,4), so (5,3) is now occupied by seg10 which moved to (5,3)? In new positions, seg10 is at (5,3), which was food location.\n> \n> But food is still under body? (5,3) has seg10 now, so food is still covered, not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,2) was under seg10, which moved to (5,3), so (5,2) is now where seg11 moved to? seg11 moved to (5,2), so (5,2) has seg11 now, still covered.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) was under seg2, which moved to (3,5), so (2,5) is now where seg3 moved to? seg3 was (2,6) moved to (2,5), so (2,5) has seg3 now, still covered.\n> \n> So after moving down, all food is still under body.\n> \n> If we move right to (4,4):\n> \n> Head to (4,4)\n> \n> Then body:\n> \n> - seg1 to (3,4)\n> \n> - seg2 to (3,5)\n> \n> - seg3 to (2,5)\n> \n> - seg4 to (2,6)\n> \n> - seg5 to (3,6)\n> \n> - seg6 to (4,6)\n> \n> - seg7 to (5,6)\n> \n> - seg8 to (5,5)\n> \n> - seg9 to (5,4)\n> \n> - seg10 to (5,3)\n> \n> - seg11 to (5,2)\n> \n> - seg12 to (4,2) — seg11 was (4,2), moves to where? seg11 was (4,2), moves to old pos of seg10, which is (5,3)? No:\n> \n> After head move to (4,4):\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Body: seg1 (was (3,5)) to (3,4) — old head\n> \n> - seg2 (was (2,5)) to (3,5) — old seg1\n> \n> - seg3 (was (2,6)) to (2,5) — old seg2\n> \n> - seg4 (was (3,6)) to (2,6) — old seg3\n> \n> - seg5 (was (4,6)) to (3,6) — old seg4\n> \n> - seg6 (was (5,6)) to (4,6) — old seg5\n> \n> - seg7 (was (5,5)) to (5,6) — old seg6\n> \n> - seg8 (was (5,4)) to (5,5) — old seg7\n> \n> - seg9 (was (5,3)) to (5,4) — old seg8\n> \n> - seg10 (was (5,2)) to (5,3) — old seg9\n> \n> - seg11 (was (4,2)) to (5,2) — old seg10\n> \n> - seg12 (tail, was (4,3)) to (4,2) — old seg11\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is now under seg10 at (5,3), still covered.\n> \n> Similarly, others.\n> \n> So initially, food is under body and not accessible. We need to move so that the body moves away from food cells.\n> \n> For example, to eat (5,3), we need the segment at (5,3) to move away, and then head to move to (5,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the body will shift over time.\n> \n> Let's see the current state: head at (3,4) down.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) life 3, so must be eaten by turn 61.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life 6, by turn 64.\n> \n> (2,5) life 9, by turn 67.\n> \n> Turn 59,60,61 for (5,3).\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,3), and no food there, I think. Food is at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5), not at (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is tail, no food mentioned there.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,4): down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n> \n> Let's evaluate both options.\n> \n> First, move down to (3,3) on turn 59.\n> \n> Then at turn 59, head at (3,3), direction down (since moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3): down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3), but not up because reverse.\n> \n> Now, (3,2): is it free? Walls: y=0 is wall, so (3,2) is ok, not wall. Obstacles: no at (3,2). Body: after move, positions include (3,4), (3,5), etc., no (3,2), so free.\n> \n> (2,3): not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (2,4) but that's different), (2,3) free? Body: no (2,3), so free.\n> \n> (4,3): but (4,3) was tail, but after move down, tail is at (4,2), and (4,3) is not occupied? After move down, positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So (4,3) is free, but is it a valid move? Right from (3,3) to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so yes.\n> \n> But (4,3) is where tail was, but now it's free.\n> \n> From (3,3), can go down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food: (5,3) is at (5,3), which is occupied by seg10 in new position. Life span now 2 (after turn 59).\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But to eat (5,3), we need head to go to (5,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, at (3,3), it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move right to (4,4) on turn 59.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction right? Previous head direction was down, but we moved right, so new direction is right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4): up to (4,5), down to (4,3), right to (5,4), left to (3,4) but reverse? Current direction right, so left would be reverse to down? Directions: if moving right, reverse is left.\n> \n> Current head direction after move: if we moved right, direction is now right.\n> \n> So from (4,4) with direction right, can move up, down, right, but not left (reverse).\n> \n> (4,5): not wall, not obstacle. Body positions: after move right, positions are head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So (4,5) is not occupied, free.\n> \n> (4,3): not occupied, free.\n> \n> (5,4): not wall, not obstacle. Body: (5,4) is occupied by seg9 in positions, seg9 at (5,4), so (5,4) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (4,4), can move up to (4,5), down to (4,3), or right to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so cannot. Only up or down.\n> \n> (4,5) or (4,3).\n> \n> Now, let's think about eating food.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) needs to be eaten soon, life span short.\n> \n> (5,3) is currently occupied, but as snake moves, it may free up.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (5,3) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Similarly, to eat it, head needs to be able to reach (5,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Let's see the snake's body movement.\n> \n> The segment at (5,3) is part of the body, and it will move to where the previous segment was when the head moves.\n> \n> For instance, if we move, the segment at (5,3) moves to (5,4) if we moved down or right, as above.\n> \n> But (5,4) is also body, so it's shifting.\n> \n> Eventually, if the snake moves away, (5,3) might be freed.\n> \n> But we need to coordinate with head movement.\n> \n> Also, there are obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Let's map the grid with snake, food, obstacles.\n> \n> Grid:\n> \n> y=7: top, y=0 bottom.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake positions turn 59:\n> \n> Head (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> Food at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5) but all under body.\n> \n> (5,3) and (5,2) are on the right column, (2,5) on left.\n> \n> Life span: (5,3) short, only 3 turns including current.\n> \n> So we should try to eat (5,3) soon.\n> \n> How to free (5,3)?\n> \n> The segment at (5,3) will move when the snake moves. For example, if we move down or right, as above, the segment that was at (5,3) moves to (5,4) or something.\n> \n> But (5,3) becomes occupied by the next segment, like seg10 moves to (5,3).\n> \n> To free (5,3), we need the segment that is there to move away and no one to move in, but since the snake is connected, when a segment moves, another moves in, so the only way to free a cell is if it's the tail and we don't eat food, so tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, (5,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> When we move, the tail moves, so if (5,3) is not tail, it might not be freed immediately.\n> \n> In fact, for a body cell to be freed, it needs to be the tail at some point, but the tail is moving.\n> \n> Let's see the tail position.\n> \n> Current tail at (4,3).\n> \n> When we move down to (3,3), new tail at (4,2).\n> \n> If we move right to (4,4), new tail at (4,2) also.\n> \n> In both cases, tail moves to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is also a body segment, but after move, it's tail.\n> \n> Now, to free a food cell, we need the snake to move so that the food cell is no longer occupied, then head can move there.\n> \n> For (5,3), it is currently occupied by seg9.\n> \n> Seg9 will move to a new position when we move.\n> \n> For example, if we move down, seg9 moves to (5,4).\n> \n> Then (5,3) is occupied by seg10 who moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move right, seg9 moves to (5,4), seg10 moves to (5,3).\n> \n> So (5,3) is always occupied by some body segment until the tail passes over it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,3), which is not (5,3), so (5,3) will be occupied for a while.\n> \n> Let's see the path of the tail.\n> \n> The tail position depends on the head movement.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has a kink; it's coiled.\n> \n> Positions: from head (3,4) down, then to (3,5) up? (3,4) to (3,5) is up, but head is moving down to (3,4) from (3,5)? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Head (3,4), next (3,5), which is up, so the body is turning.\n> \n> Then from (3,5) to (2,5) left, then to (2,6) up, then to (3,6) right, then to (4,6) right, then to (5,6) right, then to (5,5) down, then to (5,4) down, then to (5,3) down, then to (5,2) down, then to (4,2) left, then to (4,3) up.\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,3), and before that (4,2), so when we move, the tail will move from (4,3) to the previous position of seg11, which is (4,2) or (5,2), depending on move.\n> \n> But (5,3) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> To free (5,3), we need the tail to be at (5,3) at some point.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (5,3) is position 9, and tail is 12, so it will take several moves for the tail to reach that position.\n> \n> For example, each move, the tail moves to a new cell as the snake advances.\n> \n> The distance from head to the food cell in terms of body segments.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by seg9, which is 9 segments from head? Head is index 0, seg9 is index 9, so 9 steps away.\n> \n> When the head moves, the tail moves, so it takes several moves for that segment to become the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, since there are 13 segments, the segment at index i will become the tail after 12-i moves, because tail is index 12.\n> \n> For seg9 at index 9, it will become the tail after 12-9=3 moves.\n> \n> Index: head 0, then 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 tail.\n> \n> After one move, the new tail is the old seg12, but the segments shift: after move, the old seg11 becomes new seg12, etc.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at index k is now at index k-1 for k>0, and new head.\n> \n> The cell that was occupied by seg9 will be occupied by seg10 after one move, then seg11, then seg12, then when seg12 moves away, it is freed if not eaten.\n> \n> Let's say at turn t, seg9 is at (5,3).\n> \n> After one move, the snake moves, seg9 moves to where seg8 was, and seg10 moves to (5,3).\n> \n> After second move, seg10 moves to where seg9 was, so to a different cell, and seg11 moves to (5,3).\n> \n> After third move, seg11 moves away, seg12 moves to (5,3).\n> \n> After fourth move, seg12 moves away from (5,3), and if no food eaten, the cell is freed.\n> \n> But when seg12 moves away, it is no longer occupied, so (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Number of moves: from when seg9 is at (5,3), after 3 moves, seg11 is at (5,3), after 4 moves, seg12 is at (5,3), after 5 moves, seg12 moves away and (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Let's count:\n> \n> At state: seg9 at (5,3)\n> \n> After one move: seg9 moves to new pos, seg10 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> After two moves: seg10 moves to new, seg11 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> After three moves: seg11 moves to new, seg12 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> After four moves: seg12 moves to new, and since it's tail, no one moves to (5,3), so it is free.\n> \n> So after 4 moves from now, (5,3) could be free, but only if we don't eat food in between, because if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases, and the cell might not be freed.\n> \n> If we eat food, the tail stays, so the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> To free a body-occupied cell, we need to not eat food and let the tail move away.\n> \n> For (5,3) to be free, we need to make 4 moves without eating food, so that the tail moves past it.\n> \n> But at turn 59, after 4 moves, it would be turn 63, but (5,3) life span is 3, so at turn 62 it disappears, before turn 63.\n> \n> Turn 59: life 3\n> \n> Turn 60: life 2\n> \n> Turn 61: life 1\n> \n> Turn 62: life 0, gone.\n> \n> After 4 moves from turn 59: turn 60,61,62,63.\n> \n> At turn 63, after move, (5,3) would be free, but at turn 62 it is gone, so we cannot eat it because it disappears before it can be freed.\n> \n> Similarly, if we start from now, after 3 moves, at turn 62 after move, but let's see.\n> \n> At turn 59, (5,3) occupied.\n> \n> After turn 59 move: at turn 60, (5,3) occupied by seg10 or something.\n> \n> From above, after one move (turn 60), seg10 at (5,3) if we moved.\n> \n> But life at turn 60 is 2, still there but occupied.\n> \n> After two moves (turn 61), seg11 at (5,3), life 1.\n> \n> After three moves (turn 62), seg12 at (5,3), but at turn 62, life is 0, so food is gone, and seg12 is there.\n> \n> But we can't eat because food is gone.\n> \n> So for (5,3), since it's under body and life span is short, it's impossible to eat it because by the time it could be freed, it has disappeared.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn when we move.\n> \n> At turn 59, before move, food at (5,3) with life 3.\n> \n> After we move on turn 59, the state updates, life decreases to 2 for turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, after turn 60 move, life 1 for turn 61, and so on.\n> \n> The food can be eaten when the head moves onto it on a turn when life >0.\n> \n> But since it's occupied by body, head can't move there until it's free.\n> \n> But as above, it won't be free until after turn 62, when life is 0.\n> \n> Specifically, the earliest it could be free is after the move on turn 62, but at that point, for turn 62, after move, life is 0, so no food.\n> \n> On turn 61, before move, life is 1, but (5,3) is occupied by seg11 or something, not free, so head can't go there.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat (5,3) because it is covered by the snake's body for its entire remaining life, and we can't free it in time.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,2), life 6, so it might be possible.\n> \n> But for now, (5,3) is not eatable; we should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) life 6, and (2,5) life 9.\n> \n> (2,5) is also under body, seg2 at turn 59.\n> \n> Seg2 at index 2.\n> \n> To free (2,5), it will take more moves.\n> \n> Seg2 at (2,5)\n> \n> After moves:\n> \n> After one move: seg2 moves to new, seg3 moves to (2,5)\n> \n> After two moves: seg3 moves, seg4 moves to (2,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After 10 moves: seg11 moves to (2,5)?

It's turn 60, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning the snake can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I must avoid those cells too.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (3,3), and the direction is D (down). But direction D means moving down, which is decreasing y, I think? Let me confirm the coordinate system. The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up? Typically in grids, y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1), which might imply that y=0 is bottom and y=7 is top, or something. Let's see.\n> \n> The movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1)  -- so if y increases, that might be upward if we think of (0,0) as bottom-left.\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1)  -- y decreases, so downward.\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y)\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> But snake positions: head at (3,3), direction D. Direction D means last move was down, so from (3,4) to (3,3)?

(3,4) has higher y, so if U is (x,y+1), that means higher y is upward, so (3,4) is north of (3,3)? But direction is D, down, which is to lower y.\n> \n> Let's list positions in order: head (3,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> From head (3,3) to (3,4): that's an increase in y, so from (3,3) to (3,4) is moving up? But direction is given as D, which is down. Inconsistency.\n> \n> Direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" – this probably means the current direction the head is facing, or the last move direction. Since positions are given with head first, the direction should be the direction from the second segment to the head.\n> \n> Standard in Snake games, the direction is the direction the head is moving towards.\n> \n> Here, head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (3,4). Since (3,4) has same x, higher y, that means the snake was moving down to (3,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> If the snake was moving down, from (3,4) to (3,3), that makes sense because moving down decreases y. So positions: segment before head is (3,4), so head moved from (3,4) to (3,3) by moving down. Similarly, before that, from (3,5) to (3,4), etc.\n> \n> So current head position is (3,3), and since it moved down to get there, direction is D.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since direction is D, I can't move U (up) instantly, because no instant reverse. So from current direction D, I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right), but not U.\n> \n> Moving D would be to (3,2), but y=2 is within bounds.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3,2,1) – this is (x,y, life_span, value).

Let me read the state:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (5, 3, 2, 1)\n> - (5, 2, 5, 1)\n> - (2, 5, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> And in the core rules, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but here it's not separated; it's all in one parenthesis.\n> \n> I think it's implied that (5,3,2,1) means position (5,3), life_span 2, value 1. Similarly, (5,2,5,1) is (5,2), life_span 5, value 1, and (2,5,8,1) is (2,5), life_span 8, value 1.\n> \n> Value is 1 for all, so all positive food? Value 1, and it says positive food has value +1, negative has -1, but here all values are 1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Life_span: for (5,3) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 60, so for food at (5,3), life_span 2, so it will disappear after turn 61? Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life_span L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it exists for L turns, including the current turn.\n> \n> So for (5,3): life_span 2, at turn 60, it will disappear after turn 61. After turn 60, life_span becomes 1, after turn 61, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): life_span 5, disappears after turn 64.\n> \n> (2,5): life_span 8, disappears after turn 67.\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (3,3)\n> \n> Body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,3) is a body segment?

The old tail S12 (4,2) is vacated.\n> \n> So now, food at (5,3) was under old S10, but after move, new S11 is at (5,3), so still occupied? Old S10 was (5,3), new S11 is at old S10 (5,3), so (5,3) is still occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) was S11, now new S12 at (5,2), so occupied.\n> \n> (2,5) was S3, now new S4 at (2,5), occupied.\n> \n> So the food cells are still under body after this move.\n> \n> To eat the food, we need the body to move away, meaning that the cell is vacated, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> For example, for (5,3), it is currently occupied. When the snake moves, if the segment on (5,3) moves away, and no new segment comes, then it might be free, but in this case, since the snake is moving, segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically, for (5,3), it is occupied by S10. When snake moves, S10 will move to a new position, so (5,3) is vacated only if no other segment moves to it, which in this case, since segments move to previous positions, (5,3) is left empty only if not occupied by another segment immediately.\n> \n> In the move, when S10 moves to old S9 position, (5,4), then (5,3) is free, unless head or another segment moves there.\n> \n> In general, after a move, the cell that was the tail is vacated, and other cells may be occupied or not.\n> \n> In this case, after moving head to (3,2), the vacated cell is (4,2), which was tail. (5,3) is now occupied by new S11, which came from old S10 position.\n> \n> But old S10 was at (5,3), and new S11 is at old S10, so (5,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is now occupied by new S12.\n> \n> So the food cells are still under body.\n> \n> To free (5,3), we need the segment on it to move away without another segment taking its place immediately, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the one that is covered.\n> \n> Specifically, for a body cell to be vacated, it must be that the segment leaves and no new segment enters, which is the case for the tail position when the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten, the tail moves, so one cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for cells that are not tail, they are occupied by the next segment when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, when snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in line, so the only cell that becomes empty is the previous tail position.\n> \n> Other positions are either occupied by the same segment or by the next one.\n> \n> In this case, the previous tail was (4,2), so after move, (4,2) is empty.\n> \n> (5,3) is still occupied by the segment that was at (5,4) moved to (5,3), etc.\n> \n> So to have (5,3) free, we need the segment currently on it to move away, and since it moves to the position of the segment before it, (5,4) in this case, then (5,3) is free only if no other segment moves to it, which doesn't happen if the snake is moving without growing.\n> \n> But when the snake grows, by eating food, the tail doesn't move, so no cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for now, no eating, so tail moves, one cell vacated.\n> \n> But for (5,3), it is not the tail, so it won't be vacated in the next move; it will be occupied by the segment that was at (5,4).\n> \n> To free (5,3), we need to move the snake such that the segment on (5,3) moves to a different position, and no segment comes to (5,3), which means that (5,3) must be the tail or something, but it's not.\n> \n> The only way to free a body cell is to have the snake move so that the segment on that cell moves away and the cell is not reoccupied, which happens when the tail moves.\n> \n> But for a cell in the middle, it is reoccupied by the next segment.\n> \n> For example, cell (5,3) has segment S10. When snake moves, S10 moves to the position of S9, which is (5,4), so (5,3) is left empty. Then, the cell (5,3) is free, because no new segment moves to it; the head is moving to a new position, and segments are shifting, but the position (5,3) is not occupied by any new segment unless the head moves there or something.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Positions before move: S10 at (5,3)\n> \n> After move: S10 moves to where S9 was, which is (5,4) in this case, so the cell (5,3) is no longer occupied by S10. Now, is there any other segment that moves to (5,3)? Only if the head moves there, but head is moving to (3,2), not to (5,3). Other segments move to the position of the previous segment, so S11 moves to where S10 was, which is (5,3). S11 was at (5,2), and after move, new S11 moves to old S10 position, which is (5,3).\n> \n> So new S11 is at (5,3), so (5,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, only the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves without eating, the cell that was the tail is vacated, and all other body cells are still occupied, but by different segments.\n> \n> For a food under body to be eatable, the snake must move so that the body moves off that cell, and then later the head can move onto it.\n> \n> Specifically, for (5,3), it is currently occupied. When the segment moves off, it will be free at some point.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves down to (3,2), then as above, (5,3) is still occupied by new S11.\n> \n> But the segment that was on (5,3) is now at (5,4).\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is occupied by the segment that was at (5,2).\n> \n> So the food at (5,3) is still under the body.\n> \n> To have it free, we need the snake to move in a way that the tail is at that position or something.\n> \n> Perhaps we need to move the snake so that the body leaves the food cell and it is not immediately reoccupied, but it always is reoccupied by the next segment if it's not the tail.\n> \n> Only when the food cell is the tail position, and the snake moves, the tail moves away and the cell is free.\n> \n> For example, currently, tail is at (4,2). If we move, tail moves to (5,2), and (4,2) is free.\n> \n> But food is at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5), not at (4,2).\n> \n> For (5,2), it is currently S11, which is not tail. Tail is S12 at (4,2).\n> \n> If we move, S11 moves to (5,3), and new S12 moves to old S11 (5,2), so (5,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, to free (5,2), it needs to be the tail.\n> \n> So for food under body, to eat it, we need to first move the snake so that the food cell becomes the tail position, then when the snake moves, the tail moves away, cell is free, then head can move onto it.\n> \n> But the tail moves every turn, so it's not easy.\n> \n> Since the body moves, the food cell can be freed if it is occupied by a segment that is not the last, and when that segment moves, the cell is free for a moment, but in the next turn, if no segment moves to it, it stays free.\n> \n> In the move, when a segment moves from a cell, that cell is free, and it stays free unless the head or another segment moves to it in the same turn, but since segments move one at a time, but in terms of grid, after the move, the grid is updated.\n> \n> After each move, the snake occupies new positions, and the cell that was tail is empty, other cells are occupied by the shifted segments.\n> \n> For a cell that was body but not tail, it is occupied by a different segment after move.\n> \n> The only cell that becomes empty is the previous tail position.\n> \n> For other cells, they may be occupied or not, but for a food under body, it remains under body unless it is the tail position.\n> \n> For example, if the food is at a position that is the current tail, then when snake moves (without eating), the tail moves, cell is free, and food can be eaten if head moves there later.\n> \n> But if food is under a body segment that is not tail, it stays under body until that segment becomes the tail, which takes many moves.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), it is S10, which is not tail; tail is S12. To make S10 the tail, we need to eat food or something to grow, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the relative position changes.\n> \n> Perhaps I should ignore the food for now and think about safe paths.\n> \n> First, let's find where the head can go.\n> \n> Current position (3,3), direction D, so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> Move D to (3,2): (3,2) is free? No wall, no obstacle. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is not, so free. Not occupied by snake, as per positions.\n> \n> After moving to (3,2), the new head direction is D, since we moved down.\n> \n> Then from there, can move D, L, R, but not U.\n> \n> Move L to (2,3): (2,3) free? Walls: x=0 wall, x=2>0, ok. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different, not listed, so free. Snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), not (2,3), so free.\n> \n> If move L to (2,3), new direction L.\n> \n> Then can move U, D, L, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> Move R to (4,3): (4,3) free? Walls ok, obstacles none at (4,3), snake positions: (3,3), (4,6), (4,2), not (4,3), so free.\n> \n> New direction R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger mentioned: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,2), head at (3,3), which are adjacent? (3,3) and (4,2): delta x=1, delta y=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so U, D, L, R, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,3) adjacent to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3). Tail at (4,2) is not adjacent to head; it's diagonal, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) has short life, only 2 turns, so it will disappear after turn 61. That means on turn 61 it is still there, but after that gone.\n> \n> Since current turn 60, on turn 60, if we can eat it, but it's under body, so not possible immediately.\n> \n> To eat it, we need (5,3) to be free and head move there.\n> \n> Currently, it's occupied by S10.\n> \n> When can it be free? Only when the segment on it moves away and no segment moves to it, which means that it must be the tail position when the snake moves.\n> \n> Currently tail is at (4,2). The food at (5,3) is S10, which is 2 positions from tail? S10, S11, S12, so S10 is third from tail.\n> \n> To make (5,3) the tail, we need to have the tail at that position, but it's not.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the tail position changes.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move in a way that the snake shortens or something, but only by not eating food.\n> \n> But we want to eat food to grow.\n> \n> Another idea: if we move the snake such that the body moves off the food cell, and the head moves onto it when it's free.\n> \n> But as we saw, when the body moves off, the cell is immediately reoccupied by the next segment, so it's never free unless it is the tail.\n> \n> For example, if a body segment is on the food, when it moves, the cell is free for that instant, but in the next state, the next segment moves to it, so it is occupied again.\n> \n> Therefore, the only way to free a food cell under body is to have it be the tail position when the snake moves; then after move, it is free.\n> \n> Otherwise, it stays occupied.\n> \n> So for (5,3), to eat it, we need to first make it the tail position, then move the snake so that tail moves away, cell free, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> But to make it the tail position, we need to not eat food for a while, so that the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,2). The segment at (5,3) is S10. The tail will reach S10 in some turns if no growth.\n> \n> But if we eat food, the snake grows, tail doesn't move, so it takes longer.\n> \n> Since (5,3) has short life, we may not have time to make it tail.\n> \n> For example, to make (5,3) the tail, we need to move 2 times without eating, because there are 2 segments after S10: S11 and S12.\n> \n> After 2 moves without eating, S10 will be the tail.\n> \n> Current positions: S10 at (5,3), S11 at (5,2), S12 at (4,2)\n> \n> After one move without eating, new tail is old S11, which is at (5,2) if we move, but let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 60, head at (3,3), tail at (4,2)\n> \n> If we move to (3,2), for example, new head (3,2), new tail at (5,2) (old S11)\n> \n> S10 was at (5,3), now new S11 at (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, say turn 61, if we move again without eating, new tail at old S11 position, which is (5,3) if no change, but positions change.\n> \n> After first move to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), S1 (3,3), S2 (3,4), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,6), S6 (3,6), S7 (4,6), S8 (5,6), S9 (5,5), S10 (5,4), S11 (5,3), S12 (5,2) tail.\n> \n> So now tail at (5,2), and (5,3) is occupied by S11.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) has life_span 2 at turn 60, so at turn 61, after turn 60, life_span decreases to 1, so on turn 61 it exists, after turn 61 it disappears.\n> \n> On turn 61, if we move, and if we can free (5,3), but it is occupied by S11, which is not tail; tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> After move on turn 61, if we move to some position, new tail at old S11 position, which is (5,3), so (5,3) is vacated, but the food is at (5,3), and after move, it is free, but the head is not on it; the head is moving to a new position.\n> \n> On turn 61, after the move, (5,3) is free if it was tail, but in this case, on turn 61, before move, positions have (5,3) occupied by S11, tail at (5,2).\n> \n> After move, if we move head to some cell, new tail at old S11 position (5,3), so (5,3) is vacated, and food is there, but head is not on (5,3), so we don't eat it; it is just free now.\n> \n> Then on the next turn, head can move to (5,3) to eat it, but on turn 62, the food may be gone if life_span expired.\n> \n> For (5,3), at turn 60 life_span 2, so on turn 61 it is still there with life_span 1, after turn 61 it disappears.\n> \n> So on turn 61, before any move, food at (5,3) is present with life_span 1.\n> \n> If on turn 61, we move the snake, and after move, the cell (5,3) is vacated (if it was tail), but in this case, on turn 61, before move, (5,3) is not tail; tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> After move, (5,3) is vacated only if it was the tail position before move, which it is not.\n> \n> In general, after a move, the cell that was the tail before the move is vacated.\n> \n> For (5,3) to be vacated on a turn, it must be the tail position at the beginning of that turn.\n> \n> Then when we move, it is left empty.\n> \n> But for eating, we need the head to move onto it when it is free and has food.\n> \n> For (5,3), it is not tail now, and with short life, we may not be able to eat it in time.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Perhaps for (5,3), it's not worth pursuing because of short life and it's under body.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) has life_span 5, so more time.\n> \n> (2,5) has life_span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> But all are under body now.\n> \n> So perhaps I should focus on moving to areas where food might spawn or to free space.\n> \n> But no new food is mentioned; only these three are given.\n> \n> The state has only these food positions.\n> \n> So I need to plan to eat them when possible.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> From (3,3), options:\n> \n> - D to (3,2): then from there, can go to (3,1), but (3,1) is free?

Snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), etc. So (3,3) is the second segment, which is the body. Moving to (3,3) would cause a collision because the head would hit the body immediately.\n> \n> The rules say: body collision if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the tail segment because the tail moves away, but only if it's the tail.\n> \n> Let's list the snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,2) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 5: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 7: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 8: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 9: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 10: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 11: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 12: (5,2) tail\n> \n> So tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, from head (3,2), moving:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) – this is position index 1, which is the body, not tail. So collision.\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) – y=1, but walls at y=0, so y=1 is within bounds? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (3,1) has x=3, y=1, y=1 is not 0 or 7, so it should be free, but need to check obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).

Snake positions: (3,2) head, body at (3,3) to (5,2), so (3,1) not occupied. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed, so free. Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not wall, so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): not in snake, not obstacle (obstacles are (1,2), but (2,2) different), so free.\n> \n> (4,2): free.\n> \n> Now, food: there is food at (5,3) with life span 1, which is this turn, turn 61.

Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: after move, new head at new position, then the old head becomes new segment 1, old segment 1 becomes segment 2, ..., up to the tail.\n> \n> Let's list current positions:\n> \n> 0: (3,2) head\n> \n> 1: (3,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (2,5)\n> \n> 5: (2,6)\n> \n> 6: (3,6)\n> \n> 7: (4,6)\n> \n> 8: (5,6)\n> \n> 9: (5,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,4)\n> \n> 11: (5,3)\n> \n> 12: (5,2) tail\n> \n> If I move down to (3,1), new head at (3,1).

No.\n> \n> After moving, the new snake has new head at (3,1), then the first body segment is the old head (3,2), then old segment 1 (3,3), ..., old segment 11 (5,3), and the tail old segment 12 (5,2) is removed?

Obstacles are specific points: (6,4), (5,1), etc. (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is not, so (4,1) should be accessible unless it's wall, but walls are only borders and those points. Borders are walls, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are all walls, but internal cells are free except the obstacles listed. So (4,1): x=4, y=1, not border, not in obstacle list, so free.\n> \n> - Right to (5,2): (5,2) has food, and it's not occupied by snake?

When head moves, the body follows, so after move, new positions: head to (5,2), then the previous head (4,2) becomes part of body, so the new snake: head (5,2), then (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), ..., up to tail (5,3). But (5,3) was the tail, now it moves? When snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases, so tail stays in place; if not, tail moves.\n> \n> So, if I move to (5,2) and eat food, then new head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (5,3) but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the segment before tail is added, but let's list:\n> \n> Current positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] 13 segments.\n> \n> After moving right to (5,2): head moves to (5,2), and since food eaten, the tail stays, so new positions: head (5,2), then the previous positions except tail is not removed, so it becomes: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] 14 segments.

The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,4), it's currently covered, so to eat it, the snake must move away from (3,4) first, then head can move there later.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5).\n> \n> Also, life span: (2,5) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 67 if not eaten (since current turn 63, countdown decreases each turn including current, so turns left: 5,4,3,2,1, gone after turn 67? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current turn.\n> \n> So at turn 63, life span 5: it will be there for turns 63,64,65,66,67? Disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something?

After turn 67, when countdown to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at the start of turn t, life span is given, and at the end of the turn, after action, it decreases? I think we need to be precise.\n> \n> But for planning, since we move and then food might be eaten or countdown decreases.\n> \n> Typically in such games, at the beginning of turn, food is present with its life span, then snake moves, if head on food, it eats, then after that, for uneaten food, life span decreases by 1, and if 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> To simplify, let's assume that at turn t, with life span N, it will be available until turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> But since countdown includes current turn, I think:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span N: present\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1, life span becomes 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For food (2,5): turn 63, life span 5, so present from turn 63 to 67 inclusive. After turn 67, it disappears before turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): life span 8, turn 63 to 70 inclusive.\n> \n> Now back to moves.\n> \n> From (5,2), I can go up to (5,3) or right to (6,2).\n> \n> If I go right to (6,2), that's moving in the current direction, which is fine.\n> \n> If I go up to (5,3), that's changing direction, but not opposite, so allowed.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food and long-term survival.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) and (3,4) are both under the body, so I need to free them first to eat.\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied by index 6: (2,5), and (3,4) by index 4: (3,4).\n> \n> The snake is currently at positions around there.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger mentioned: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (5,3), and there is no food there, so not an issue now, but I should be careful in the future.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the path.\n> \n> First, the snake is long, 14 segments, so it takes up space.

Food positions: (2,5), (3,4), (1,1). None at (5,5), so no food on tail, so moving to tail should be safe, as tail moves away.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), tail at (5,5). If I move up to (5,5), I occupy (5,5), and the tail was at (5,5), but since I eat nothing, length unchanged, tail moves to the previous position? No.\n> \n> When I move, if I don't eat food, the snake moves forward, head to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell with food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> But here, if I move to (5,5), which is currently tail, but there is no food there, so if I move to (5,5), since it's empty now? (5,5) is occupied by tail, but when I move head to (5,5), at that moment, tail is still there, but since it's the tail, and no food, the head moves to (5,5), and since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so effectively, the snake moves, and (5,5) becomes head, and the old tail cell is free.\n> \n> Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But when head moves to tail position, since no food, the tail is removed, so no collision.\n> \n> Only if there was food on the tail cell and I eat it, then problem with Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> But here, no food at (5,5), so moving to (5,5) should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions.\n> \n> Adjacent cells from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): (5,5) - currently tail\n> \n> - Down (D): (5,3) - but (5,3) is body segment index 1, so moving there would cause collision, deadly.\n> \n> D is invalid anyway because of no reverse, but even if, it's body.\n> \n> - Left (L): (4,4) - what is this?

But need to check walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (4,4) is within 1 to 6? x=4, y=4, grid from 0 to 7, so x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so (4,4) is not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,4) not among them, so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): (6,4) - but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (6,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, deadly.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: (5,5) - tail, no food, safe\n> \n> - L: (4,4) - free cell, safe\n> \n> - R: (6,4) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (5,3) - body, and reverse, invalid\n> \n> So only U or L are possible actions for turn 65.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 67 or it disappears.\n> \n> Currently at turn 65, so it has 3 turns: 65,66,67. After turn 67, it disappears. So to eat it, head must be on (2,5) on turn 65,66, or 67.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,4): life span 6, so eat by turn 70.\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by snake body (index 6). So to eat it, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is also occupied by snake body (index 8).\n> \n> (2,5) is index 8, and food is there.\n> \n> (3,4) index 6, food there.\n> \n> And (1,1) free, not occupied.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, for turn 65, I can go U or L.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,5), which is tail.\n> \n> After moving U: head moves to (5,5), since no food eaten, tail (5,5) was there, but tail is removed, so new snake positions: head (5,5), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, and so on, up to the segment before tail.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0 to 13: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> After move U to (5,5): head moves to (5,5). Since (5,5) was tail, and no food, so tail is removed. The new head is (5,5), and the body segments from index 1 to 12: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) — but (5,6) was index 12, which is not tail, tail was (5,5) index 13.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5), the segment that was index 13 (tail) is removed, and the new body is the previous positions from index 0 to 12, but shifted.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,5), then body: (5,4) [old head], (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) — and (5,6) was index 12, now index 13?

Originally 14 segments, after move without eating, length decreases? No.\n> \n> Snake length: if no food eaten, when head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length decreases by one? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> In snake game, when snake moves to an empty cell, it moves forward: head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed. So the snake length remains the same, only if it eats food, it grows.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten, so snake length should stay the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: start with 14 segments.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, say (5,5), which was tail. The new head is (5,5), the segment that was head (5,4) becomes body, and so on, down to the segment that was before tail. The tail was (5,5), which is now head, so the new tail is the segment that was second to last, which was (5,6) index 12.\n> \n> List indices:\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> 0: (5,4) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,2)\n> \n> 3: (4,2)\n> \n> 4: (3,2)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (3,4)\n> \n> 7: (3,5)\n> \n> 8: (2,5)\n> \n> 9: (2,6)\n> \n> 10: (3,6)\n> \n> 11: (4,6)\n> \n> 12: (5,6)\n> \n> 13: (5,5) tail\n> \n> After move U to (5,5):\n> \n> New head: (5,5) — this was old index 13\n> \n> Then, the body: the previous positions of segments 0 to 12 become the new body segments 1 to 13.\n> \n> Specifically: new segment 1: old head (5,4) [index 0]\n> \n> New segment 2: old (5,3) [1]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to new segment 14: old (5,6) [12]\n> \n> But old index 13 was (5,5), which is now head, so it's not in the body anymore.

It's turn 66. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I must avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So the snake has 14 segments. Head direction is left, so from (4,4), it was moving left to (3,4), but (3,4) is part of the body? Let's see the positions: head is (4,4), next is (5,4), which is right of head? That doesn't make sense for movement.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed as [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. Head is (4,4), and it says head direction is L, meaning left. But from (4,4), moving left would be to (3,4), but (3,4) is the 8th position in the list? Let's index them:\n> \n> Index: 0: (4,4) head\n> \n> 1: (5,4)  // this is right of head, but head direction is left? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are ordered from head to tail, so head is at (4,4), and the next segment is (5,4), which is to the right. But if head direction is left, that means it was moving left to reach (4,4), but from where? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The head direction is given as the direction it is facing now, so at turn 66, head is at (4,4) and it is facing left, meaning it came from the right? No, the direction is the current facing direction.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, the head direction indicates which way it will move if no change. But here, it says \"Snake Head Direction: L\" for left. So from (4,4), moving left would go to (3,4).\n> \n> But in the positions, (3,4) is listed as the 7th segment: positions[7] is (3,4). And positions[0] is (4,4), positions[1] is (5,4), which is east, so the snake is coiled or something.\n> \n> Let me plot this to understand.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - 1: (5,4)  // right\n> \n> - 2: (5,3)  // down from (5,4)\n> \n> - 3: (5,2)  // down\n> \n> - 4: (4,2)  // left from (5,2)\n> \n> - 5: (3,2)  // left\n> \n> - 6: (3,3)  // up\n> \n> - 7: (3,4)  // right? (3,3) to (3,4) is right, but (3,4) is at same y, x+1? (3,3) to (3,4) is east.\n> \n> (3,3) to (3,4): x from 3 to 4, so moving right.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - 8: (3,5)  // up from (3,4) to (3,5)\n> \n> - 9: (2,5)  // left from (3,5) to (2,5)\n> \n> - 10: (2,6)  // up from (2,5) to (2,6)\n> \n> - 11: (3,6)  // right from (2,6) to (3,6)\n> \n> - 12: (4,6)  // right from (3,6) to (4,6)\n> \n> - 13: (5,6)  // right from (4,6) to (5,6)\n> \n> So the snake body is from (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,6) to (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,4), and it is facing left, so it can move to (3,4), (4,5), or (4,3), but not right to (5,4) because that's the body and also opposite direction? Head direction is left, so possible moves: left to (3,4), up to (4,5), down to (4,3). Cannot move right to (5,4) because that would be opposite to current direction L, and also it's occupied by body.\n> \n> The rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move right. Also, moving to (5,4) is invalid because it's the body segment.\n> \n> Available moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Left: (3,4) - but (3,4) is a body segment? Positions[7] is (3,4), which is part of the body. But in Snake, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so if head moves to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently occupied by the body, it might cause collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it's collision, except if it's the tail cell, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is positions[7], which is not the tail; tail is (5,6). So moving to (3,4) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, let's list all body positions except head.\n> \n> Body positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So (3,4) is occupied, so moving left to (3,4) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Now, up: (4,5) - is it occupied? Let's see: (4,5) not in positions, so empty? Positions are: (4,4), (5,4), etc., no (4,5), so (4,5) should be free.\n> \n> Down: (4,3) - not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Right: (5,4) - occupied by body, and also opposite direction, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up to (4,5) or Down to (4,3).\n> \n> But head direction is left, but moving up or down is allowed, not reverse.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All positive food, value 1 each.\n> \n> But (3,4) is currently occupied by the snake body at positions[7], and life span 5, so it might disappear after 5 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is occupied by positions[9], (2,5), and life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 turns, meaning at turn 68 it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 66, life span 2, so after this turn, it becomes 1, then after turn 67, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only if head moves there while it exists.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): life span 2 at turn 66. After turn 66, it decreases to 1, exists. After turn 67, decreases to 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 66 or 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) life span 5 at turn 66, decreases to 4 after turn 66, etc., exists until turn 70.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 8, exists until turn 73.\n> \n> But food can only be eaten if head moves onto it when it's not occupied or when the body moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, for food under body, it can be eaten only if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, for (3,4), it is currently occupied by the body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that (3,4) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5).\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6). Head is at (4,4), not adjacent to (5,6). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) and (5,6) are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,6) neighbors: (5,5), (5,7), (4,6), (6,6). (4,4) is not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 66: from (4,4), can move Up to (4,5) or Down to (4,3).\n> \n> If move Up to (4,5): new head position (4,5), then body follows: tail moves away from (5,6), so the segment at (5,6) moves to (4,6)? When head moves, the body shifts: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,5), then segment 1 (was (5,4)) moves to (4,4)? Positions: after move up, head is at (4,5), then the old head (4,4) becomes body, so positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., up to (5,6) but shifted.\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0 to 13: (4,4)H, (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)T\n> \n> After moving up to (4,5): new head at (4,5), then the body: position 1 (5,4) moves to where head was (4,4)?

its lifespan. Moving left to open areas avoids immediate dead ends and prioritizes long-term survival by navigating toward the less constrained upper-left region, allowing flexibility for future food opportunities.\n",

It's turn 67, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), and it's moving Up. The body segments are: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> (4,6) is the tail, I think. Positions are given from head to tail, so index 0: head, index 13: tail? Let's count: positions have 14 elements? From (4,5) to (4,6) – that's 14 cells.\n> \n> Indices: 0: (4,5), 1: (4,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6). Yes, 14 segments. So the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (4,5) from (4,4) I assume? Positions: from (4,4) to (4,5), so it moved Up to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life_span given.\n> \n> Life_span: for (2,5), life_span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L, it's gone. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, life_span is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,5): at turn 67, life_span=1, so after this turn, on turn 68, it should be gone? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn 67, life_span=1, meaning after this turn, it will decrease to 0 and disappear? I think it's better to think: when we are at turn t, the life_span indicates how many turns it will last, including the current turn. So if life_span=1 at turn t, it will be available only during turn t, and disappear before turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span=4 at turn t, it will last for turns t, t+1, t+2, t+3, and disappear before turn t+4.\n> \n> In this case, turn 67:\n> \n> - (2,5): life_span=1, so it must be eaten now or never; it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> - (3,4): life_span=4, so available for turns 67,68,69,70.\n> \n> - (1,1): life_span=7, available for turns 67 to 73.\n> \n> - (6,5): life_span=10, available for turns 67 to 76.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) is at (2,5). Looking at snake positions, (2,5) is position 10 in the list: (2,5) is a body segment? Snake positions: index 10 is (2,5), which is part of the body.\n> \n> But food is at (2,5), which is occupied by the snake body. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So currently, (2,5) has food, but it's under the body segment at index 10. To eat it, the snake must move such that the body moves away from (2,5), and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> But life_span is 1 for this food, so it must be eaten this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) has food with life_span 4. (3,4) is snake position index 8: (3,4) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is also under the body.\n> \n> (1,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: let's list all: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (1,1) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is an obstacle, so (1,1) might be accessible? (1,1) is not wall, but (1,2) is obstacle, so movement to (1,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), direction Up. So from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since direction is U, cannot move D (down) immediately, as that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5): U, L, R. D is invalid because reverse.\n> \n> U: (4,6) – but (4,6) is the tail position? Snake positions: (4,6) is index 13, tail.\n> \n> Moving to tail is allowed only if the tail moves away, but let's see.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions from current position (4,5):\n> \n> - U: to (4,6)\n> \n> - D: invalid, reverse\n> \n> - L: to (3,5)\n> \n> - R: to (5,5)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> (4,6): is this a wall? Borders: y=7 is wall, but (4,6) is y=6, x=4, not border. Internal obstacles: none at (4,6), so it should be free, but it's currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> According to rules, moving into tail is allowed if the tail moves away; since the snake moves, the tail will advance, so it's safe as long as no other body part is there after move.\n> \n> General rule: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that was tail, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> But collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail position is safe.\n> \n> Now, (4,6) is tail, so moving U to (4,6) is safe; after move, tail moves from (4,6) to where? Depends on the move.\n> \n> Similarly, other positions.\n> \n> Also, walls: (4,6) is not wall.\n> \n> L: to (3,5). (3,5) is snake position index 9: (3,5), which is a body segment, not tail. Index 9 is (3,5), and tail is (4,6), so (3,5) is not tail; it's a body part. Moving to (3,5) would cause collision because head touches body segment that doesn't move away immediately.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,5), which is currently occupied by segment 9. After move, the head is at (3,5), and the body segments shift: the old head (4,5) becomes new segment 1, (4,4) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to segment 12 (3,6) becomes new segment 13, and segment 13 (4,6) is gone? Positions: after move, the new head is at (3,5), then the previous positions: segment 1 was (4,4), but it moves to where the head was? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n> \n> So positions: current head at index 0: (4,5)\n> \n> If head moves to new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then new segment 0: new_head\n> \n> Segment 1: old segment 0 position\n> \n> Segment 2: old segment 1 position\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment k: old segment k-1 position\n> \n> And the last segment, old tail, is removed.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,5), which is currently occupied by segment 9: (3,5).\n> \n> After move, new head at (3,5), then segment 1: old head position (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 10: old segment 9 position?

Old 9 is (3,5), and new head is (3,5), so after move, new segment 10 would be at old 9 position (3,5), but new head is also at (3,5), so collision at (3,5) between head and segment 10.\n> \n> Specifically, the head is at (3,5) and segment 10 is also at (3,5) after the move? No.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head at (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1 at old segment 0 position: (4,5)\n> \n> - New segment 2 at old segment 1 position: (4,4)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment 10 at old segment 9 position: (3,5)  // old segment 9 is (3,5), so new segment 10 is at (3,5)\n> \n> But new head is at (3,5), so both head and segment 10 are at (3,5), which is a collision.

(5,5) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (5,5). So (5,5) should be free, but check walls: x=5,y=5, not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — no (5,5), so (5,5) is empty. So moving R to (5,5) should be safe.\n> \n> U: to (4,6), which is current tail position. After move, new head at (4,6), new segment 1 at (4,5), and so on, and the old tail at (4,6) is left, but new head is at (4,6), so since it was tail and tail moves, it should be ok.

Old segments: after move, new seg1: old head (4,5), new seg2: old seg1 (4,4), ..., new seg13: old seg12 (3,6).

When we move, the tail moves away from (4,6), but (2,5) is not tail.\n> \n> The segment at (2,5) will stay if we don't eat food, or move in a way that it shifts.\n> \n> In this case, since we don't eat food this turn (because no food at head position), the snake doesn't grow, so when we move, the tail position is vacated, but (2,5) is not tail; it's a middle segment that moves to the next position but stays occupied unless it was tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for any body segment not tail, when snake moves without eating, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell it occupied might be vacated only if it was tail.\n> \n> Otherwise, cells are still occupied by the shifted segments.\n> \n> For example, in move U, old seg10 at (2,5) becomes new seg11 at (2,5), same position? No: in the move, new seg11 is at old seg10 position, which is (2,5), so it remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly for R move.\n> \n> So (2,5) remains occupied after any move this turn, so we cannot eat the food at (2,5) this turn because to eat, we need the cell to be free when head moves to it, but it's not free now and won't be free after move since the body segment stays.\n> \n> Unless we move in a way that the segment leaves (2,5), but in this configuration, since (2,5) is not tail, and we don't eat, it stays occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> In fact, for a body segment, when snake moves without eating, the segment moves to the position of the segment ahead, but since it's a chain, the cell is reoccupied immediately.\n> \n> The only cell that is vacated is the old tail position.\n> \n> But (2,5) is not tail, so it remains occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (2,5) this turn because the cell is occupied and won't be freed. Even if we could move head there, we can't because it's occupied by body.\n> \n> So (2,5) food will disappear after this turn, uneaten.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,4) has food under body at segment 8: (3,4), life_span 4.\n> \n> Similarly, to eat it, we need to free (3,4) and move head there.\n> \n> (1,1) is free, and (6,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), possible moves: U or R.\n> \n> U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate options.\n> \n> If move U to (4,6): new head (4,6), which was tail.

It's turn 68, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable. But there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (5,5)\n> \n> 2. (4,5)\n> \n> 3. (4,4)\n> \n> 4. (5,4)\n> \n> 5. (5,3)\n> \n> 6. (5,2)\n> \n> 7. (4,2)\n> \n> 8. (3,2)\n> \n> 9. (3,3)\n> \n> 10.

Head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 4? The format says (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 4, 4, 1)\" so it's (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (1,1,6,1) and (6,5,9,1). All have value 1, but one has life span 4, one 6, one 9. And value is +1 for all, since it says value1, etc., and in the rules, positive food has +1.\n> \n> In the food list: (3,4,4,1) means (x=3,y=4), life_span=4, value=+1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1,6,1) : x=1,y=1, life_span=6, value=+1\n> \n> (6,5,9,1): x=6,y=5, life_span=9, value=+1\n> \n> But I need to check if any food is under the snake. Looking at snake positions: segment 10 is (3,4), and there's food at (3,4). So food is under the body at (3,4).\n> \n> According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, life span: for (3,4), life_span=4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if current turn is 68, it will disappear after turn 68+4-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So after N turns, it disappears. \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L: after L turns, it disappears, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, it becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown=0, so at the start of turn t+L, it's gone.

After moving, the snake body will move, so collision only if head hits body after move.\n> \n> - D to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by snake segment 4, (5,4).

Snake positions: no one at (6,5). Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different. So (6,5) is free with food. If I move R, I go to (6,5), eat the food, snake grows to 15 segments, tail stays or moves? When eating, length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't advance, meaning the new segment is added at head, tail remains.\n> \n> Rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when eaten, snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In movement, typically, when you move to food, you eat it, and the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> If not eaten, tail moves, head moves, length same.\n> \n> Here: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, snake length increases by one, so tail does not move that turn.\n> \n> If no food, tail moves forward, head moves, length same.\n> \n> Also, for negative food, but here all food is positive, value +1.\n> \n> Now, moving R to (6,5): (6,5) is within bounds, no wall, no obstacle, no body, and has food, so I can move there and eat it.

Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall, x=6 not wall. Obstacles: no obstacle at (6,6). Snake: after move, positions include (6,5) head, (5,5) body, etc., but (6,6) not occupied yet. So U to (6,6) is possible.\n> \n> But from (6,5), moving U to (6,6) is ok, but then I'm at (6,6), which is corner, might be risky.\n> \n> If I move to (6,5) now, I eat the food, but then I'm at (6,5) with limited moves: only U is safe, since D is obstacle, L is body, R is wall.\n> \n> U to (6,6) is only option.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) but (6,5) is now body? After moving to (6,6), positions: if I move U from (6,5), head to (6,6), body: since no food eaten, tail moves, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ... and tail (3,6) moves? Let's trace.\n> \n> After eating at turn 68, head to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — 15 segments.\n> \n> Then turn 69, I move U to (6,6). No food at (6,6), so snake moves: head to (6,6), tail moves away from (3,6) to the next, but tail was (3,6), after moving, tail segment is removed, so new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and (3,6) is gone, so tail is now (2,6).\n> \n> Segments: from head: (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — 15 segments, tail at (2,6).\n> \n> Now from (6,6), direction U. Possible moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid. D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body segment, so collision. L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall. Only L to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> (5,6) is free? y=6, x=5.

Segment (3,4) is at index 10, which is still occupied, so food is still under body.\n> \n> To eat (3,4), I need the body to move away from it, and then head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, (3,4) is occupied by the 10th segment.\n> \n> The body will move when the snake moves, but only if no food is eaten, tail moves, so the segments shift.\n> \n> For example, at turn 68, if I don't eat, I move to a new position, tail moves, so all segments shift.\n> \n> After moving to (5,6), the new positions: let's list the cells:\n> \n> - Head: (5,6)\n> \n> - Seg1: (5,5)  // previous head\n> \n> - Seg2: (4,5)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - Seg3: (4,4)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - Seg4: (5,4)  // previous seg3\n> \n> - Seg5: (5,3)  // previous seg4\n> \n> - Seg6: (5,2)  // previous seg5\n> \n> - Seg7: (4,2)  // previous seg6\n> \n> - Seg8: (3,2)  // previous seg7\n> \n> - Seg9: (3,3)  // previous seg8\n> \n> - Seg10: (3,4)  // previous seg9\n> \n> - Seg11: (3,5)  // previous seg10\n> \n> - Seg12: (2,5)  // previous seg11\n> \n> - Seg13: (2,6)  // previous seg12, and previous seg13 (3,6) is gone.\n> \n> So (3,4) is still occupied by seg10, which is the same cell, so food is still under the body.\n> \n> The body at (3,4) will only move when the tail moves further, but it's not the tail yet.\n> \n> To free (3,4), I need to have the snake move so that the segment on (3,4) moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the segment on (3,4) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> For example, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So at turn 68, if I move to (5,6), the segment that was at (3,4) (seg10) will move to where seg9 was, which is (3,3), because seg9 was at (3,3) and moves to where seg8 was, etc.\n> \n> From above: after move, seg10 is at (3,4), but seg10 is the one that was at (3,4) before? Let's think of the indices.\n> \n> At turn 68, positions: index 0: (5,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,6), no eat, so tail moves away: new head at (5,6), then body: position of index 0 becomes new index 1, so new index 1: (5,5), new index 2: (4,5) which was index 1, new index 3: (4,4) index 2, new index 4: (5,4) index 3, new index 5: (5,3) index 4, new index 6: (5,2) index 5, new index 7: (4,2) index 6, new index 8: (3,2) index 7, new index 9: (3,3) index 8, new index 10: (3,4) index 9, new index 11: (3,5) index 10, new index 12: (2,5) index 11, new index 13: (2,6) index 12, and index 13 (tail) is gone.\n> \n> The cell (3,4) is now occupied by new index 10, which came from index 9, which was at (3,4) before? Index 9 at turn 68 was (3,4), and after move, new index 10 is at (3,4), but it's a different segment? The cell (3,4) is still occupied by the snake, now by the segment that was previously at (3,3), but the point is, the cell (3,4) is still occupied after the move, so food is still under it.\n> \n> To free (3,4), I need to move in such a way that the segment on it moves away and no other segment is on it immediately.\n> \n> Since the snake moves sequentially, the cell (3,4) will be free only when the segment that is on it moves to another position and no new segment comes to it at the same turn.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is on (3,4), and I move, tail moves away, then (3,4) is free if not occupied.\n> \n> But here, (3,4) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> The segment on (3,4) will move to the position of the previous segment when the snake moves.\n> \n> So to free (3,4), I need that after the move, no segment is at (3,4), which means that the segment that was at (3,4) must move to a different cell, and the cell it moves to is not (3,4), which it isn't, and also that no other segment moves to (3,4).\n> \n> The only way a segment moves to (3,4) is if it was the next segment in line, but since it's a chain, when the head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the cell that was occupied by a segment might be left empty if it was the tail, or occupied by the next segment if not.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell with a body segment, when the snake moves, that cell is vacated only if the segment on it was the tail and it moves away. Otherwise, if it's not the tail, the next segment moves into it, so it remains occupied.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is not the tail; it's in the middle, so when the snake moves, the segment that was at (3,4) moves to the position of the segment ahead of it, and the segment behind it moves to (3,4), so (3,4) remains occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> Therefore, (3,4) will never be free as long as the snake is on it, until the part of the snake on it moves away completely, which takes multiple moves.\n> \n> For example, to free (3,4), I need to have the tail be at that position or something.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, it might take many moves to free (3,4).\n> \n> Let's see the position of (3,4) in the snake.\n> \n> At turn 68, (3,4) is occupied by segment 9 (index from 0: head 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at (3,4)? Index 9 is (3,4), so it's the 10th segment, but in terms of distance from head.\n> \n> The head is at (5,5), (3,4) is at distance.\n> \n> From head to (3,4): let's see the path.\n> \n> Head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), then (3,4). So (3,4) is 9 steps from head? Positions: 0:(5,5), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,4), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,3), 5:(5,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(3,2), 8:(3,3), 9:(3,4), so index 9.\n> \n> Since there are 14 segments, the tail is at index 13.\n> \n> To free (3,4), I need to move the snake so that the segment at index 9 moves, but when I move, index 9 will move to where index 8 was, and index 10 will move to index 9, so (3,4) is now occupied by index 10, which was (3,5), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> After each move, the cell (3,4) will be occupied by a different segment until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,6), which is index 13.\n> \n> The tail will move when we move without eating.\n> \n> Each time we move without eating, the tail moves forward one step.\n> \n> From (3,6), where can it move? It depends on the direction, but since it's the tail, it follows the body.\n> \n> The tail will eventually reach (3,4) if the snake moves that way.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (3,4) is index 9, tail at index 13.\n> \n> After 4 moves without eating, the tail will be at index 9 position, which is (3,4), and on the 5th move, if we don't eat, tail moves away from (3,4), freeing it.\n> \n> Let's calculate.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the tail moves k steps.\n> \n> Current tail index 13 at (3,6).\n> \n> The positions from index 9 to 13: index 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6)\n> \n> So to have the tail at (3,4), it needs to be at index 9 position.\n> \n> After 4 moves without eating, the snake shortens by 4 at the tail, so the new tail would be the segment that was at index 4, but the indices shift.\n> \n> After first move without eating, tail index 13 is removed, new tail is index 12 at (2,6).\n> \n> After second move, new tail index 11 at (2,5).\n> \n> After third, new tail index 10 at (3,5).\n> \n> After fourth, new tail index 9 at (3,4).\n> \n> After fifth move without eating, the tail (now at index 9 position (3,4)) moves away, and (3,4) is free.\n> \n> But during this, the food at (3,4) has life span only 4 turns, from turn 68 to 71 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 68: current, can be eaten if free.\n> \n> But at turn 68, it's occupied.\n> \n> After turn 68 move, if no eat, at turn 69, still occupied as above.\n> \n> After turn 69 move no eat, at turn 70, occupied.\n> \n> After turn 70 move no eat, at turn 71, occupied.\n> \n> At turn 71, if we move and the tail moves away, (3,4) is free at the beginning of turn 72?

New positions up to index 12 since tail removed.\n> \n> Old k=13, new k=12 for 13 segments.\n> \n> After move, number of segments same if no food, so new list has 13 segments? No.\n> \n> Start with 14 segments.\n> \n> After move to empty cell, snake length same, so 14 segments? No.\n> \n> Positions list has 14 elements, after moving to empty cell, the tail is removed, so new positions have 13 elements: the new head, and the first 13 of the old body, but shifted.\n> \n> Standard: after moving to empty cell, new head at new position, then the old head position becomes the new neck, and so on, up to the old second-to-last position becomes the new tail; the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So with N segments, after move to empty cell, new positions: new head, then old P[0] to P[N-2], so N-1 positions from old, but P[0] to P[N-2] are included, that's N-1 points, plus new head, so N segments.\n> \n> For example, old positions: P[0] to P[13], 14 points.\n> \n> After move to H_new with no food:\n> \n> New positions: Q[0] = H_new\n> \n> Q[1] = P[0]\n> \n> Q[2] = P[1]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Q[13] = P[12]  // because P[13] is the old tail, removed, so P[12] becomes new tail.\n> \n> So for cell (3,4), which was P[10], after move, the segment that was at P[10] is now at Q[11] position? Q[11] = P[10], so the segment is still at (3,4) if it doesn't move, but the position is occupied by the same segment or different?\n> \n> The cell (3,4) was occupied by P[10]. After move, Q[11] is at old P[10] = (3,4), so (3,4) is still occupied by the same body segment, now at index 11.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell that was P[9] = (3,3) is now occupied by Q[10] = P[9] = (3,3), so no change.\n> \n> The only cell vacated is the old tail position P[13] = (2,6), which is now free.\n> \n> For a body cell to be vacated, it must be that the segment moves away and no other segment moves in, but in the shift, the segments move to the previous position, so the only cell that becomes free is the old tail position when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> Other body cells remain occupied unless the snake eats and grows, but then no cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for food under body at (3,4), it can only be eaten when the snake moves such that the head moves to (3,4) after the body has moved away from it.\n> \n> But from above, the body segment at (3,4) only moves when the snake moves, and it moves to the position of the previous segment, so (3,4) is always occupied unless that segment is the tail and it moves, but here it's not tail.\n> \n> The cell (3,4) will be occupied until the segment that is there becomes the tail and the snake moves, then it might be vacated.\n> \n> Currently at turn 69, P[10] at (3,4).\n> \n> After a move, Q[11] at P[10] = (3,4), so still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, it will be at R[12] at Q[11] position, etc.\n> \n> The segment at (3,4) will stay there until the tail catches up, but as the snake moves, the position (3,4) may be occupied by different segments, but the cell itself is always occupied until the part of the body that is fixed there moves away, but in this case, since the snake is moving, the body is shifting, so the cell (3,4) is only free when no segment is assigned to it, which happens when the tail moves past it, but for that, the snake must be moving in a way that the body leaves that cell.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves such that the segment that was at (3,4) moves to a new position, and no new segment moves in, but in the shift, when a segment moves, another segment takes its place.\n> \n> The only way for (3,4) to be free is if the snake shortens or moves in a way that the body leaves it empty, but with no eating, it only shortens at the tail.\n> \n> So (3,4) will be occupied until the tail is at that position and the snake moves, then it is vacated.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (2,6), and the body includes (3,4), (3,3), etc.\n> \n> The distance from tail to (3,4): tail at P[13]=(2,6), P[12]=(2,5), P[11]=(3,5), P[10]=(3,4), so (3,4) is 3 segments from tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves closer to (3,4) in terms of indices, but the positions change.\n> \n> After one move without eating, new tail is at old P[12] = (2,5), and P[10] = (3,4) is now at Q[11], still occupied.\n> \n> After two moves, new tail at old P[11] = (3,5), and (3,4) is at R[12] or something, still occupied.\n> \n> After three moves, if no eating, the segment that was at (3,4) might be closer to tail.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 69, positions: P[10] at (3,4)\n> \n> After turn 69 move, say we move to H_new, no food, then Q[11] at old P[10] = (3,4)\n> \n> After turn 70 move, no food, new positions: R[0] = new head, R[1] = Q[0], ..., R[12] = Q[11] = (3,4)  (since Q has 13 segments, Q[11] is the 12th, etc.)\n> \n> Assume no food eaten for simplicity.\n> \n> After each move, the position (3,4) is still occupied, and the segment there is the one that was previously closer to head.\n> \n> It will be occupied until the tail reaches that point.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,6), and the body is connected, so the tail will reach (3,4) in several moves.\n> \n> For example, from tail (2,6) to (2,5) to (3,5) to (3,4), so after 3 moves, the tail will be at (3,4), and when the snake moves next, (3,4) will be vacated.\n> \n> At turn 69, tail at (2,6)\n> \n> After turn 69 move: tail at old P[12] = (2,5)\n> \n> After turn 70 move: tail at old P[11] = (3,5)  (since after first move, Q[12] = old P[11] = (3,5))\n> \n> After turn 71 move: tail at old P[10] = (3,4)\n> \n> Then at turn 72, when snake moves, if no food, the cell (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> But life span of food at (3,4) is 3, so at turn 69, life span 3, can be eaten on 69,70,71.\n> \n> By turn 71, it can be eaten, but on turn 71, if tail is at (3,4), and head moves to it, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> Let's see the timeline.\n> \n> Turn 69: food at (3,4) can be eaten, but it's occupied by body, so head cannot move there.\n> \n> Turn 70: after turn 69 move, if no one eats, food still there, but (3,4) still occupied, as above.\n> \n> Turn 71: similarly, occupied until after turn 71 move.\n> \n> At turn 71, food can be eaten, but if (3,4) is occupied, head can't move there.\n> \n> The food disappears after turn 71, meaning after the turn is processed, so at the start of turn 72, it is gone if not eaten by then.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 69, life span 3.\n> \n> After turn 69, if not eaten, life span becomes 2.\n> \n> After turn 70, life span 1.\n> \n> After turn 71, life span 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 72 or later.\n> \n> So can be eaten on turn 69,70, or 71.\n> \n> But on each of these turns, (3,4) is occupied by a body segment, so head cannot move there to eat it, because the cell is occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (3,4) because it is under the body and the snake is too long, so it won't be vacated in time.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> From above, (3,4) is occupied on turns 69,70,71 because the body is on it.\n> \n> On turn 71, for example, if the tail is at (3,5) or something, but (3,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> Let's find out where (3,4) is on each turn.\n> \n> At turn 69: occupied by P[10]\n> \n> After turn 69 move: assume we move, no food eaten, then new positions, (3,4) occupied by Q[11]

So allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R.\n> \n> From (4,6), moving:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – is this free? Let's see the snake positions: snake has segments at (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), etc. (4,5) is a body segment. But according to rules, I can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail. Let's see what the tail is.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So tail is (2,5).\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), that cell is currently occupied by a body segment, but when I move, the snake moves, so the tail moves away. Specifically, if head moves to a new cell, and if it doesn't eat food, the tail is removed. So moving to (4,5) might be possible if that cell is freed.\n> \n> (4,5) is the fourth segment. When head moves, if no food eaten, the tail (2,5) is removed, and head goes to new position, so (4,5) would become the new position for the third segment or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is cut off, so the cell that was tail is freed. Other body segments shift.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (4,5), which is currently occupied by a body segment, but since the snake moves, that cell might be freed or not.\n> \n> Rule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, for food under body: it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> But for movement, when considering where to move, I need to check if the cell is safe.\n> \n> For (4,5): it is currently occupied by a body segment. Is it the tail? No, tail is (2,5). So (4,5) is not tail, so moving to (4,5) would cause collision, because head touches body segment that is not tail.\n> \n> Confirm with positions: head at (4,6), moving to (4,5). (4,5) is occupied by the fourth segment. After move, head would be at (4,5), and that segment was at (4,5), but since head moves there, it's now the new head position, but during the move, when head enters (4,5), it collides with the existing body there before it moves? I think collision is checked before the move or during.\n> \n> I need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> Typically in snake games, collision is checked after the head moves to the new cell, but before the tail is updated. So if the new head position is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's collision. If it's the tail, it's ok because tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (2,5). So moving to (4,5) would cause collision with the body at (4,5).\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (3,6): what is (3,6)? Is it free? Snake positions don't have (3,6), and walls: borders, but x=3,y=6 is within bounds? Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,6): y=6 is not border, border is y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is inside. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (3,6) is not an obstacle. Snake positions: list has (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). No (3,6), so (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> Moving D to (4,5) is invalid because occupied by body.\n> \n> Moving U to (4,7) is invalid because y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,6) is invalid because (5,6) is the second segment, not tail, and also instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - occupied by body, collision risk? Yes, since not tail.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) - seems free\n> \n> - R: (5,6) - occupied by body and instant reverse, invalid\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,6)? But that can't be right; let me double-check.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> Move U: (x,y+1) = (4,7), y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Move D: (x,y-1) = (4,5), y=5. Now, (4,5) is in snake positions: it's the fourth segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause head to collide with body segment.\n> \n> Move L: (x-1,y) = (3,6). (3,6) is not in snake positions, not a wall, not obstacle. So free.\n> \n> Move R: (x+1,y) = (5,6). (5,6) is the second segment, occupied, and also moving right is opposite to left, so instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is L to (3,6).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid size. Walls: border x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls. Playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,6): x=3, y=6, which is within 1-6, so valid.\n> \n> No internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), etc. No (3,6), so it should be free.\n> \n> Perhaps I should list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So 14 cells occupied.\n> \n> Food at (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by snake? (3,4) is the 12th segment? Positions: let's index from head.\n> \n> Head: (4,6) - index 0\n> \n> 1: (5,6)\n> \n> 2: (5,5)\n> \n> 3: (4,5)\n> \n> 4: (4,4)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (5,3)\n> \n> 7: (5,2)\n> \n> 8: (4,2)\n> \n> 9: (3,2)\n> \n> 10: (3,3)\n> \n> 11: (3,4)  <--- this is food position? Food at (3,4,2,1) but (3,4) is also a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2,10,1) and (3,2) is also a body segment.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For now, for movement, (3,6) is free.\n> \n> So from (4,6), only possible move is L to (3,6).\n> \n> But that seems limiting. Let's confirm if D to (4,5) is possible.\n> \n> (4,5) is currently occupied, and it's not the tail. When the head moves, if it goes to (4,5), at that moment, (4,5) is occupied by a body segment (which is not tail), so collision occurs before the snake moves. So yes, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, only (3,6) is free.\n> \n> But y=6 is the top row, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall, so y=6 is the highest row before wall.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), the snake will have head at (3,6), then the body: (4,6) becomes first body segment, (5,6) second, and so on, but tail (2,5) is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food at (3,6), tail is removed.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (3,4) life span 2, so on turn 70, life span 2, meaning it disappears after turn 72? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For food at (3,4): turn 70, life_span 2, so countdown: turn 70: 2, turn 71: 1, turn 72: 0, disappears after turn 72, so can be eaten on turn 70 or 71.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life_span 4: turn 70:4, turn 71:3, turn 72:2, turn 73:1, turn 74:0, disappears after 74.\n> \n> (6,5) life_span 7: disappears after turn 77.\n> \n> (3,2) life_span 10: disappears after turn 80.\n> \n> All value +1.\n> \n> But (3,4) and (3,2) are under snake body.\n> \n> (3,4) is occupied by snake segment, so to eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2).\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,6), moving to (3,6) is the only option for turn 70.\n> \n> So for turn 70, action must be L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then on turn 71, head at (3,6), direction L? After moving left, new head direction is L.\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - what is (3,5)? Snake positions after turn 70 move.\n> \n> After turn 70: head moves to (3,6), so new positions: head (3,6), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Tail was (2,5) but removed, so body from index 1 to 13: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So 13 segments now.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves turn 71:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - (3,5) is the last body segment? After move, positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) is the 13th segment, which is the tail? Let's list: indices: 0 head (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (5,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (3,3), 12: (3,4), 13: (3,5). So (3,5) is tail.\n> \n> Moving D to (3,5): since (3,5) is tail, and head moves there, it should be ok because tail will move away. But if I move to (3,5), and there is no food, tail is removed, so no collision. But (3,5) has no food, I think. Food is at (3,4), (1,1), etc., not at (3,5).\n> \n> Food positions: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5), (3,2). No (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is safe, and since it's tail, no collision.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - what is (2,6)? Free? Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions. Snake has (3,6), (4,6), etc., no (2,6). So free.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) - but (4,6) is now the first body segment, occupied, and also moving right would be opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is tail, so moving there is safe, but no food, so snake shortens? When head moves to a cell, if no food, tail is removed, so length same? No, if no food eaten, tail is removed, so snake length decreases by 1? No.\n> \n> Standard: if head moves to empty cell, tail is removed, so length remains the same? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Initial length: 14 segments.\n> \n> After move to (3,6) no food, tail removed, so now 13 segments.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,5), which is tail, no food, then new head at (3,5), but (3,5) was tail, so it becomes head, and since no food, the new tail is the previous segment, but the snake shortens because tail was removed but head moved to where tail was, so effectively, the segment is kept? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, snake grows: head moves to food, food eaten, tail not removed, so length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length remains the same.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): (3,5) is currently tail, but when head moves there, it is a new position for head, and since no food, the tail (which was (3,5)) is removed, but head is now at (3,5), so it's like the tail position is vacated and head occupies it, but since it was the tail, no collision, and length decreases? No.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (3,6), body including tail (3,5).\n> \n> Head moves to (3,5). Since (3,5) was tail, and head moves there, it is not collision because tail moves away. After move, head is at (3,5), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (3,6) becomes the new first body segment, and the segment that was at (3,5) is no longer part of snake, so it is removed. So the new snake has head at (3,5), and body from (3,6) to the previous body except the tail is gone. So length decreases by 1? No.\n> \n> Previous positions: 14 segments? After turn 70, we have 13 segments.\n> \n> After turn 70: positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — that's 14 positions? Head and 13 body, total 14 segments.\n> \n> Turn 70: head moved to (3,6), so new head (3,6), then the previous head (4,6) becomes body, so positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (3,5) is tail. 14 segments? But I thought tail was removed.\n> \n> When head moves to (3,6) which is empty, no food, so tail is removed. Tail was (2,5) before move, but after move, (2,5) is removed, so the body segments are from (4,6) to (3,5), but (3,5) was not tail before.\n> \n> Before turn 70 move: positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). Tail (2,5).\n> \n> Head moves to (3,6) empty, no food. So new head (3,6), then body: the first body segment is the previous head position (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). The tail (2,5) is not included, so only 13 segments: head and 12 body segments.\n> \n> Positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (3,4) is tail? Let's list:\n> \n> Index 0: head (3,6)\n> \n> Index 1: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 3: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 6: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 7: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (5,2)\n> \n> Index 9: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 10: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 11: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 12: (3,4)  <-- tail\n> \n> (3,5) is not in the list because it was after (3,4) and before (2,5), but (2,5) was tail and removed, so (3,4) is now tail.\n> \n> Previous positions had (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). After move, head to (3,6), body from (4,6) to (3,4), and (3,5) and (2,5) removed, so tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Positions after turn 70: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So 13 segments, tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is under the tail now.\n> \n> Back to turn 71, head at (3,6), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - (3,5) is free? Not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle. Snake has (3,6), (4,6), etc., no (3,5). Food? No food at (3,5), so free.

Tail was (3,4), so (3,4) is now free. Food is at (3,4), but head is not moving to (3,4), it's moving to (3,5).

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls at x=0 and x=7 mean columns 1 to 6 are playable, and similarly for y. So grid is 6x6? No: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that's 6x6 cells. But positions given include (3,6), etc., so let's list all coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 3? Wait, format is (x,y, value, life_span) I think. Let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (3, 4, 1, 1) - (1, 1, 3, 1) - (6, 5, 6, 1) - (3, 2, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). So:\n> \n> - Food at (3,4): value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - Food at (1,1): value 3, life span 1? Wait, it says (1,1,3,1), so value=3? But earlier it says positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here value=3 for (1,1), but the core rules say \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", so maybe it's a typo or something? No, look: in the food list, it has values like 1,3,6,9, but core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. There might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\". But in the state, food has values like 1,3,6,9. Perhaps the value indicates the score gain? But core rules say +1 for positive. Maybe in this game, food can have different values? But the core rules don't specify that. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and in this case, for (1,1,3,1), value=3, which might mean it's worth 3 points? But core rules say positive food is +1. Inconsistency?\n> \n> Perhaps I misread the core rules. Core rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", but it doesn't say that all food has value +1; it might be that value can vary. But it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, implying that positive food always gives +1. But here in state, we have value=3, etc. Let's see the state input format.\n> \n> State input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and examples given: (3,4,1,1), (1,1,3,1), (6,5,6,1), (3,2,9,1). So value can be greater than 1. But core rules say for positive food, reward value is +1. This is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps \"Reward Value = +1\" is a default, but in specific instances, it can be different? But the core rules don't mention that. Let me read the core rules again.\n> \n> \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n> \n> It says Reward Value = +1, so I think for all positive food, it should be +1 point. But here values are 1,3,6,9, which are not all 1. Unless value here is not the reward, but something else? No, it says \"Value and Life Span\".\n> \n> Another possibility: \"value\" in the food list is the life span? No, it's listed as separate. Format: (x,y, value, life_span)\n> \n> For (3,4,1,1): x=3,y=4, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (1,1,3,1): x=1,y=1, value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> But core rules say positive food has reward value +1, so value=3 contradicts that.\n> \n> Perhaps \"value\" here is the life span? But no, it says \"Value and Life Span\" and lists two numbers.\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in the core rules or the state. But the core rules say: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\", so for positive food, it should always be +1 point, and for negative, -1 point.\n> \n> But in the state, we have values like 3,6,9, which suggest different points. Unless these are not the reward values, but I think it is.\n> \n> Perhaps the \"value\" in the food list is the reward value, and it can be different, but the core rules didn't specify that. This is ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me look at the special cases: it says \"Tail Reward Danger\", but no mention of varying values.\n> \n> I think for the sake of this problem, I should go by the state given. So food at (1,1) has value 3, meaning it gives +3 points if eaten, and similarly, (6,5) has value 6, (3,2) has value 9. But (3,4) has value 1, which is +1.\n> \n> Also, all have life span decreasing, and must be eaten before it disappears.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,4), life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 71, life span 1 means it will disappear at the end of turn 71 if not eaten. Similarly, (1,1) life span 3, so it has 3 turns left including turn 71, so it will disappear after turn 73? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N, countdown starts from N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — including current turn, so at the beginning of turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1. So if N=1, at turn t, if not eaten by the end of turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for N=3, at turn t, life span 3, after turn t it becomes 2, after turn t+1 it becomes 1, after turn t+2 it becomes 0 and disappears, so it lasts for turns t, t+1, t+2, disappearing at end of t+2.\n> \n> In this case, turn t1=71.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 1 — so if not eaten on turn 71, it disappears forever.\n> \n> - (1,1): value 3, life span 3 — so available for turns 71,72,73, disappears after turn 73.\n> \n> - (6,5): value 6, life span 6 — available for turns 71 to 76.\n> \n> - (3,2): value 9, life span 9 — available for turns 71 to 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,6), direction L, so moving left, which is decreasing x.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because of no instant reverse. Current direction L, so cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 71: L, U, or D.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except walls at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Also borders are walls, so cells like (1,1) is not wall, since x=1,y=1, borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,1) is playable, but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so (1,2) is wall.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But since play area is from (1,1) to (6,6), these are not accessible anyway.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: the snake occupies multiple cells. Head at (3,6), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is a food position, but also occupied by snake body? Food at (3,4) and snake has a segment at (3,4)? Let's see snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> So positions include (3,4), (3,3), etc. (3,4) is the 13th segment?

But (3,5) is before head in position, but in the list, it's last, so tail is (3,5)? The list is head first, so segment 0 is head, segment 13 is tail. Positions: from (3,6) to (3,5), with body in between.\n> \n> Specifically, (3,4) is occupied by segment 12, which is part of the body.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is on a cell occupied by the snake body. But according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for food at (3,4), it is currently under the snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (3,4), then head moves to (3,4).\n> \n> But life span is 1, so only on this turn, turn 71, it can be eaten, otherwise it disappears.\n> \n> But if the snake doesn't move to (3,4) on this turn, it can't be eaten later because life span 1, so only chance is now.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (3,6), and (3,4) is two steps away, so impossible to reach in one turn. Head at (3,6), to reach (3,4), it needs to move down? y decreases down? Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). Assuming y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, and snake at (3,6), which is near top if y=7 is top? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row.\n> \n> Define coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but walls, so playable x=1 to 6. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Or y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Since walls, the playable cells are y=1 to y=6, with y=1 being the bottom row if y=0 is below, but typically in such games, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is row above bottom, but since y=0 is wall, y=1 is the bottom playable row.\n> \n> Similarly, y=6 is top playable row.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — moving up, increasing y\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — moving down, decreasing y\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) — left, decreasing x\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) — right, increasing x\n> \n> Snake head at (3,6), which is x=3, y=6. Since y=6, moving U (up) would go to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. Similarly, moving D (down) to (3,5) or L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> But R to (4,6) is occupied by the body, segment 1: (4,6), so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (2,6): is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied or blocked.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,5) is the tail? List: segment 13 is (3,5), which is the tail. But when snake moves, the tail will move, so (3,5) might be free after move, but at the start of turn, before move, (3,5) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> When considering move, for collision, we need to see if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body after the move.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and after move, the tail moves, so it's ok, no collision. But if it moves to a body segment other than tail, collision.\n> \n> Also, walls.\n> \n> So from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) — wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — currently occupied by tail segment (3,5). Since it's the tail, after move, if snake doesn't eat, tail moves away, so head can move to (3,5) safely.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) — need to check if this cell is free. Is (2,6) occupied or blocked? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc. — no (2,6), so not occupied by snake. Walls: borders y=0,y=7,x=0,x=7, so (2,6) x=2,y=6, within 1-6, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so free. So L to (2,6) is possible.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) — currently occupied by segment 1, (4,6), which is body, not tail, so if head moves there, collision, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves at turn 71: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (3,5), that is towards the tail. (3,5) is tail, so moving there is safe, and since no food there, snake doesn't grow, tail moves away.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,6), new position.\n> \n> But there is food at (3,4) with life span 1, which is adjacent to current head? Head at (3,6), (3,4) is two cells down, so not reachable in one move. Only if I move D to (3,5), then next turn to (3,4).\n> \n> But food at (3,4) has life span 1, so only available this turn, turn 71. After turn 71, it disappears, so I cannot eat it on turn 72.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 71: if not eaten during turn 71, it disappears at the end of turn 71. So only chance to eat is on turn 71.\n> \n> But head is at (3,6), food at (3,4), which is not adjacent; it's two cells away. So impossible to eat on this turn. Therefore, food at (3,4) cannot be eaten and will disappear.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) value 3, life span 3, so available for 3 turns; (6,5) value 6, life span 6; (3,2) value 9, life span 9.\n> \n> But (3,2) is also occupied by snake body? Snake segment 10: (3,2), so food at (3,2) is under body.\n> \n> Similarly, to eat it, body must move away, then head move to it.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 71 actions.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Borders are walls but not playable.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  // (3,5) is tail\n> \n> Food: (3,4) but occupied, (1,1), (6,5), (3,2) occupied.\n> \n> (6,5): is it free? (6,5) not in snake positions, not in obstacles: obstacles (6,4), but (6,5) is different. (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) should be free unless wall. x=6, y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles list: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) not listed, so free. Similarly, (1,1) is free.\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied by snake.\n> \n> Now, for turn 71, possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> If I move D to (3,5), new head position (3,5), and since no food eaten, tail moves away. Tail is (3,5), so after move, head to (3,5), which was tail, so no growth, tail moves to the previous position? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> So after moving D to (3,5), new head at (3,5), but (3,5) was tail, so now head is there, and the segment that was at (3,5) is gone, and the new tail is the previous segment, which was (3,4)?

But walls are at the borders, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid, but coordinates from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> So walls are at:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> But since playable area is inside, walls are boundaries.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 72, it has 3 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 74? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if life_span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the start of turn t + N?\n> \n> Typically, it might be: at turn t, life_span is L, then after this turn, it becomes L-1, and when L=0, it disappears. But the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think: when food is spawned, it has life_span N. At the end of each turn, including the turn it's spawned, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value). For (1,1,3,1), at turn 72, life_span=3, so after turn 72, it becomes 2, after turn 73 it becomes 1, after turn 74 it becomes 0 and disappears.

Specifically, it's the 12th segment.\n> \n> Rule about food spawning under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So (3,2) has food, but since it's under the body, I can't eat it now.

Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) is not listed, so it should be free, except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): is it blocked? (6,5) not in obstacles, so free.\n> \n> (3,2): but occupied by snake body, so food is there but under body.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.

It's turn 73. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I have to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). That's 14 segments, so the snake is 14 units long. Head direction is D, which is down, meaning it was moving down to (2,5) from (2,6) I think? Let me list the positions in order: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), etc. Since head is first, and it was moving down, from where? Previous position before head was (2,6), and now head is at (2,5), so yes, moving down.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 73, life span is 2, so it will be gone after turn 74? Let me confirm: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If L=2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 2 → can be eaten on turn 73 or 74, disappears after turn 74.\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life span 4 → can be eaten on turns 73,74,75,76, disappears after turn 76.\n> \n> - (3,2): value 1, life span 7 → can be eaten on turns 73 to 79, disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> - (2,6): value 1, life span 10 → can be eaten on turns 73 to 82, disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> All foods have value 1, so all positive food.

Snake positions: (2,5) is head, (2,6) is next, which is above, so (2,4) is not occupied? Let's see snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n> \n> So (2,4) is not in the list. Walls: border walls, so y=0 and y=7 are walls. (2,4) y=4, x=2, not a border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Oh, so (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So down to (2,4) is blocked by wall.\n> \n> Left: (1,5) - x=1,y=5. Border walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is one, but (1,5) not listed. Snake positions: is (1,5) occupied? Snake: (2,5), (2,6), etc., no (1,5), so should be free? But let's check walls: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is wall, but (1,5) is not listed, so not a wall. But is it within bounds? x=1, y=5, between 0 and 7, so yes.\n> \n> Right: (3,5) - x=3,y=5. Not border, not in internal obstacles (internal are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2)), so not wall. Snake positions: head (2,5), next is (2,6), then (3,6), etc. (3,5) not in list, so free?

So (3,5) is not occupied, and not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> But (3,5) is not listed in snake, so yes.\n> \n> Also, up: but cannot move up because instant reverse. Current direction down, moving up would be opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - Down: (2,4) but wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (1,5)\n> \n> - Right: (3,5)\n> \n> - Up: not allowed.\n> \n> So only left or right.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n> \n> (2,6) is a food, but (2,6) is occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, it's the second segment. Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6) is the first body segment. And food at (2,6) with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So currently, (2,6) has food, but it's occupied by body, so cannot eat it now. Only if the snake moves such that the body leaves (2,6) and later head comes back.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) has food, and (3,2) is the 13th segment? Snake positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (4,4), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (3,3). So (3,2) is the 12th segment? Positions list: indices from 0 to 13, 14 segments. (3,2) is position 12, which is a body segment, so food is under it, but cannot eat now.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is position 1, body segment with food.\n> \n> Other foods: (1,1) and (6,5) are not occupied, I think.\n> \n> (1,1): x=1,y=1, not in snake positions? Snake: all positions have y from 2 to 6, x from 2 to 5, except (1,1) not there. Similarly (6,5): x=6,y=5, not in snake? Snake has (5,5), (5,6), etc., but not (6,5). (6,5) is free.\n> \n> (6,5) is not wall? Internal obstacle (6,4), but (6,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly (1,1): not wall except borders, but x=1,y=1 not border wall, and not internal obstacle listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, immediate choices: move left to (1,5) or right to (3,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (1,5), what happens?\n> \n> New head position (1,5), direction becomes L (since I moved left).\n> \n> Then snake moves: head to (1,5), tail moves away? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten ( (1,5) has no food, I think), so length remains 14, tail segment (3,3) is removed, and body shifts.\n> \n> Positions: new head (1,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,6), (3,6), etc., up to (3,3) is removed.\n> \n> After move to (1,5): positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). (3,3) is gone.\n> \n> (3,2) is still there, with food under it? (3,2) has food, and it's still occupied.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,5), new head (3,5), direction R.\n> \n> Then positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). (3,3) removed.\n> \n> (3,2) still occupied.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,6) is currently occupied, but if I move in a way that the snake body moves away from it, I can eat it later.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2).\n> \n> But (3,2) is near the tail.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> List all obstacles: border walls x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So grid is 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so accessible area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and cannot be entered. Internal cells can be entered unless obstacle.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also specific internal cells are walls.\n> \n> So accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except the internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are walls.\n> \n> So (1,2) is wall, (2,4) wall, (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), can go to (1,5) or (3,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is accessible.\n> \n> (3,5) accessible.\n> \n> Now, let's think about food.\n> \n> Food at (1,1): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 74, else disappears. Turn 73 now, so only two chances: turn 73 or 74.\n> \n> But to eat (1,1), I need to get head there.\n> \n> From (2,5), if I go left to (1,5), then to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall! Internal obstacle (1,2) is wall, so cannot go to (1,2). Therefore, from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), or left but x=0 is wall, or right to (2,5) but that's body now, or up to (1,6) but y=6, border? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is not border, but let's see.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are accessible except obstacles.\n> \n> (1,6): is it free? Not wall, not occupied? Snake after moving to (1,5), positions include (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,6) is at y=6, but (1,6) not occupied, not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> But to reach (1,1), I need to go down from (1,5) to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall, so impossible to reach (1,1). (1,1) is at (1,1), but (1,2) is adjacent but wall, so no path to (1,1). Is that right?\n> \n> (1,1) can be accessed from (1,2) or (2,1) or (0,1) but x=0 wall, or (1,0) y=0 wall. So only neighbors: up (1,2), down (1,0) wall, left (0,1) wall, right (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), but (2,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (1,1) can be reached from (2,1) or from (1,2), but (1,2) is wall, so only from (2,1).\n> \n> But (2,1) might be accessible.\n> \n> From current position, to reach (1,1), I need to go to (2,1) or something.\n> \n> But (1,1) is at (1,1), and (1,2) is wall, so to enter (1,1), I must come from (2,1), since (1,0) and (0,1) are walls.\n> \n> (1,1) neighbors: (x,y-1)=(1,0) wall, (x,y+1)=(1,2) wall, (x-1,y)=(0,1) wall, (x+1,y)=(2,1).

No.\n> \n> If head is at (2,1), and I move left to (1,1), then I eat it.\n> \n> But head direction matters for movement, but not for eating, I think.

It's turn 74. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).

No, the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So I cannot move left immediately. But for other directions, I can.\n> \n> The constraint: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from current state, since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are occupied or blocked.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are also walls, I assume, so snake cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake body: the positions are occupied except that when moving, the tail moves, so head can move to the current tail position only if it's safe after move.\n> \n> But in general, for collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, and even tail, only if after move it's not colliding.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away, so no collision. But if it moves to any other body cell, it collides and dies.\n> \n> Also, walls are deadly.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n> \n> (3,2) is listed as food, but (3,2) is also the tail position of the snake? Snake positions end with (3,2), so (3,2) is the tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But since the snake is on (3,2), it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.

Wait, the input says: (2,6,9,1) so position (2,6), value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> (2,6) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), ... so (2,6) is the third segment, which is a body part, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (3,2).\n> \n> So food at (2,6) is on a body segment.

Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) should be free, I think. But let's confirm.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): not in obstacles, not border? x=6,y=5, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) is not border, and not in internal obstacles list, so free.\n> \n> (3,2) is tail, occupied.\n> \n> (2,6) is body, occupied.\n> \n> Now, life span: (1,1) has life span 1, so after this turn (turn 74), if not eaten, it disappears. Since it's turn 74, and life span 1, it disappears after turn 74, meaning it's available only on turn 74? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1?

So to eat it, must be on turn 74.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 3, countdown 3, so available for 3 turns including current.\n> \n> (3,2) life span 6, available for 6 turns.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 9, available for 9 turns.\n> \n> But (2,6) and (3,2) are under snake, so not accessible immediately.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,5) head, then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so (3,6) is the fourth segment. So if I move up to (3,6), it's a body cell, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) – is this free? Let's see: not wall, not in snake positions? Snake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). So (3,4) not listed, should be free. Also, not wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), etc., not (3,4). So (3,4) is free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) – (4,5) is snake body? Snake: ... (5,5), (4,5), ... (4,5) is the eighth segment?

So if move right to (4,5), collision.\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) – but (2,5) is the first body segment, position 1, not tail. Also, moving left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, so moving left is instant reverse, which is not allowed.

The AI must think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,1) must be eaten this turn or it's gone, but (1,1) is at (1,1), head at (3,5), so impossible to reach in one turn. Distance: |3-1| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6, too far. So (1,1) cannot be eaten, it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, after moving down to (3,4), what happens.\n> \n> But I need to output an action sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should have action sequence for turn 74, 75, 76, etc., but since I don't know future, I need to plan based on current state and food.\n> \n> Food positions are fixed, but their life spans decrease.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food.\n> \n> In this move, if I move down to (3,4), is there food? Food at (3,4)? No, food is at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), (2,6). (3,4) not food, so no eat, snake length unchanged, tail moves forward.\n> \n> After move to (3,4), new head position (3,4), body: the previous head (3,5) becomes new body segment, and tail (3,2) moves? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n> \n> Snake positions: current: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> After moving down to (3,4):\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - New body: add (3,5) to the front, so body becomes: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)] and tail (3,2) is removed, since no growth.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: head (3,4), then segments: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Now tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Direction: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, at this point, food (1,1) is gone, since life span was 1 and not eaten on turn 74.\n> \n> Food left: (6,5) life span now 2 (since countdown decreased), (3,2) but (3,2) was tail, but now tail moved, so (3,2) is free? After move, (3,2) is vacated, so food at (3,2) is now accessible, since body moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is still occupied by body? In new positions, (2,6) is still there, index 3.\n> \n> Let's see new snake positions: indices: 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (4,4), 10: (5,4), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,2), 13: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> So (2,6) is position 3, occupied. (3,2) is not occupied now, since tail is at (4,2), so food at (3,2) is now on a free cell, and can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> (6,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple moves ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there might be tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But for now, let's see possible paths.\n> \n> First, from new position at turn 75, head at (3,4), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: (3,3) – is it free? Not wall, not in snake positions? Positions: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), etc., no (3,3), so free.\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) – but (3,5) is now the first body segment, so occupied, collision. Also, moving up is opposite to down? Current direction is D, so moving up is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – is it free? Not wall, not in snake: snake has (2,5), (2,6), not (2,4). Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an internal obstacle! From input, internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) – (4,4) is position 9 in the list, body segment, occupied. Also, moving right from (3,4) to (4,4), which is east, not opposite to down, so allowed direction, but cell occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,4) with direction D:\n> \n> - Down: (3,3) – free\n> \n> - Up: not allowed, opposite and occupied\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) – wall, cannot\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) – occupied, collision\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (3,3).\n> \n> Then, after that, head at (3,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) – now, (3,2) has food! And it's free, since not occupied now. So if move down to (3,2), eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new length increases.\n> \n> - But is it safe? (3,2) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2)? (3,2) and (4,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, the food is at (3,2), and if I move head to (3,2), the tail is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2). But the tail cell is (4,2), which does not have food; the food is at (3,2), which is where head is moving.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to (3,2), the tail is at (4,2), and (4,2) does not have food; food is at (3,2). So tail cell (4,2) has no food, so no danger. The danger is only if the tail cell itself has food and head eats that food while adjacent.\n> \n> But here, food is at a different cell.\n> \n> So moving to (3,2) should be safe and eat food.\n> \n> Other moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) – but (3,4) is previous head, now body, occupied, and moving up is opposite to current direction D? Current direction is D, so up is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) – not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: after previous move, we have head at (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,3) not in list, and not wall, so free? Internal obstacles not (2,3), so yes.\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) – similarly, not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> But from (3,3), with direction D, possible moves:\n> \n> - Down to (3,2): free and food\n> \n> - Left to (2,3): free\n> \n> - Right to (4,3): free\n> \n> - Up: not allowed, opposite and occupied.\n> \n> So I can choose to go down to eat food at (3,2).\n> \n> If I do that on turn 76 (let's sequence turns).\n> \n> Turn 74: move down to (3,4)\n> \n> Turn 75: from (3,4) only down to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 76: from (3,3) I can move down to (3,2) to eat food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new head at (3,2), body: previous positions, but tail stays, so positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) and tail was (4,2), but since ate, tail doesn't move, so (4,2) is still part, and new segment added? When eat, head moves to food, and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Current before eat: positions at turn 75: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail. So 14 segments? Original snake had 14 positions, after two moves without eating, should have 14 positions? Let's count.\n> \n> Initial positions: 14 segments including head.\n> \n> After move turn 74: moved to (3,4), no eat, so head new, tail removed, so still 14 positions? No: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so number of segments same.\n> \n> Initial: 14 positions.\n> \n> After move to (3,4): new head (3,4), added, and tail (3,2) removed, so positions: 14 segments still.\n> \n> Similarly, after move to (3,3) on turn 75: head to (3,3), tail removed, which was (4,2) in previous state? After turn 74, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) tail. 14 positions.\n> \n> After move down to (3,3): new head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) and tail (4,2) removed? Tail is (4,2), so removed, new tail is (5,2)? Positions: head (3,3), then segments: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) and since tail removed, (4,2) gone, so now 13 segments? No: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, the previous head becomes new body part, and the last segment (tail) is removed, so number of segments remains the same.\n> \n> Initial: 14 segments.\n> \n> After first move no eat: still 14 segments.\n> \n> After second move no eat: still 14 segments.\n> \n> After turn 74 move: positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)] so 14 positions, tail (4,2).\n> \n> After turn 75 move down to (3,3): new head (3,3), add previous head (3,4) to body, remove tail (4,2), so positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, at turn 76, if move down to (3,2): (3,2) has food, so eat it.

When eat, head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and new head position, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions after eat: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — 15 positions, tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Direction: moved down to (3,2), so new direction D.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Other food: (6,5) life span decreased to 1?

It's turn 75. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid internally. x from 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 cells, similarly y from 1 to 6, so yes, 6x6 playable area.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head is (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). That's 14 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is decreasing y, since (x,y-1) for D? Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases up, decreases down? In standard coordinates, y often increases upwards, but in grids, it might be different. Here, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y increases as we go up. D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y.\n> \n> Head is at (3,4), direction D, so moving down, meaning y is decreasing.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1 each.

So at turn 75, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 77? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, life span becomes N-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t. After the snake moves and eats or not, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for the next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, we need to know when it vanishes.\n> \n> For food at (6,5), life span 3 at turn 75.

It's turn 77, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. But x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are given as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid has walls on the borders and these internal obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,2), direction is D (down).

Let's count: positions from index 0 to 14, so 15 cells.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> 1. (6,5) with value 1, life span 1. So it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current. Current turn is 77, so if life span is 1, it will disappear after turn 77? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,5): life span 1, meaning it has 1 turn left, including current turn. Since current turn is 77, it will disappear after turn 77, so if not eaten on turn 77, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 77 + 5 = 82? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after t + N - 1 turns? Example: if food spawns at turn t with life span N, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Here, it's given at current turn, so for food at (6,5): life span 1, so it can be eaten only on turn 77, and disappears after.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 77 to 77 + 5 = 82? Turn 77 is current, so it has 6 turns including current: turns 77,78,79,80,81,82? But life span N means it lasts for N turns, so from spawn to disappear after N turns.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, food has life span L. After turn T, countdown decreases to L-1. If eaten on turn T, it's consumed. If not, at the end of turn T, if countdown reaches 0, it disappears? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will disappear after N full turns, so if N=1, it disappears after the current turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if N=6, it disappears after 6 turns from now.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn including current\" – so at turn T, with life span L, the countdown is L. After turn T, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For eating, it can be eaten on any turn when countdown >0.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,5): life span 1 at turn 77, so countdown=1 on turn 77. If not eaten on turn 77, after turn 77, countdown=0, and it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,6): life span 6, countdown=6 on turn 77, so can be eaten from turn 77 to 82, disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> Turn 77: countdown=6\n> \n> After turn 77: countdown=5 for turn 78\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 82: countdown=0, disappears.\n> \n> It can be eaten on turns 77 to 82 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4): life span 9, so can be eaten from turn 77 to 85.\n> \n> All food has value +1, since value is 1 for all, and it says positive food, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,2), direction D (down).

The current turn is 78. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, I should avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)]. So, the snake has 15 segments. The head direction is R, which means it's moving right, so last move was to the right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6. But (2,6) is also a part of the snake body? Let's see: snake positions include (2,6) as the 7th segment. Position 7 is (2,6). So food at (2,6) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,4) with value 1 and life span 8. (4,4) is the 13th segment in the snake positions? Positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (4,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (5,5), 11: (4,5), 12: (4,4), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,3). So (4,4) is index 12, which is part of the body. Similarly, (2,6) is index 6.\n> \n> Food mechanics: Food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Also, for (2,6), since it's the tail? Let's find the tail. The snake positions list has head first, so tail is the last element. Here, positions[14] is (5,3), so tail is at (5,3). (2,6) is not the tail; it's an intermediate segment.\n> \n> But for eating, if the head is adjacent to the tail and there's positive food on the tail, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and collides with the head. But in this case, the food is not on the tail; it's on (2,6) and (4,4), which are body segments, not tail.\n> \n> Now, life span: for food at (2,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn. So on turn 78, it has 6 turns left; on turn 79, it has 5, and so on, until turn 83 it has 1, and on turn 84 it disappears? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t to t+N-1. Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for L more turns. After turn t, it has L-1 left, and so on, until it has 0, it disappears. So for (2,6) at turn 78, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 83 (since 78 to 83 is 6 turns: 78,79,80,81,82,83 — that's 6 turns, disappears on turn 84?).\n> \n> Turn t: food present, life span L.\n> \n> After turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n> \n> When life span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next turn? Typically, it disappears when life span becomes 0.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to a cell with food on that turn, it eats it.\n> \n> So for (2,6) with life span 6 at turn 78, it will be present until the end of turn 83 (life span decreases to 0), and disappears at turn 84. Similarly for (4,4) with life span 8, present until turn 85.\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten immediately. The body needs to move away first.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider possible moves and outcomes.\n> \n> First, current head position: (4,2), direction R (right). So possible moves from here: since direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that's opposite direction, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn.\n> \n> So at turn 78, from (4,2), possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid. I should sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y in range are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Head: (4,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> Tail is (5,3)\n> \n> Food: (2,6) and (4,4), both with value +1, but currently under body.\n> \n> (2,6) is occupied by snake index 6, (4,4) by index 12.\n> \n> To eat (2,6), the body must move away from (2,6) first, then head moves there.

Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (4,3) not in list. Snake positions: look at the list, (4,3) not in the positions? Positions are: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3). So (4,3) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) — (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is different. (4,1) not in obstacles. Snake: not in positions, so free.\n> \n> (5,2): not border, obstacles? (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not. Snake: positions have (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), but not (5,2), so free.\n> \n> All three moves seem possible now, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, for (4,3), moving up, but what about the body?

Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (1,6) is not wall unless border, but y=6, not 7, so (1,6) is not wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) is not, so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is occupied by snake segment 7 in current, but after move, it might change.\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied.\n> \n> (2,7) wall.\n> \n> So from (2,6), the segment can only move to (1,6) or (3,6), but (3,6) is currently occupied?

In new positions after move to (4,3), the cells are: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)\n> \n> So (5,3) is not occupied, since tail was removed.

It's turn 79, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I must avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,1), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,2)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (2,5)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,4)  // This is the tail? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 14, so 15 segments? Snake length is 15.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> So head at (4,1), tail at (5,4). Current head direction is D, meaning down. Since it's moving down, from (4,2) to (4,1)? Positions are head first, so from head to tail. Head at (4,1), previous position was (4,2) since it moved down to (4,1). Direction is given as D, so it's facing down.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> Both (4,4) and (4,5) have food, but let's see where they are.\n> \n> First, (2,6) is a food position. But looking at snake positions, (2,6) is occupied by the snake! It's the 8th position: (2,6) is in the list, index 7 if 0-based: positions[7] is (2,6). And food is at (2,6), so it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is also in snake positions: positions[13] is (4,4), and (4,5) is positions[12] is (4,5). So all three food items are currently under the snake's body.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (2,6) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 79, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 83? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, it becomes L-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,6) at turn 79, life span 5, so countdown 5. After turn 79, countdown 4; after turn 80, countdown 3; ... after turn 83, countdown 0, so disappears after turn 83? After turn 83, it's gone for turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 7: at turn 79, countdown 7, disappears after turn 85 (since after 7 turns: turn 79 to 85, countdown 0 after turn 85).\n> \n> Turn 79: countdown 7\n> \n> Turn 80: countdown 6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 85: countdown 0, so after turn 85, it disappears, so not available on turn 86.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 10: countdown 10 at turn 79, disappears after turn 88.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,1), direction down. Since it's moving down, and head is at (4,1), y=1, and walls at y=0, so moving down to (4,0) is impossible, since y=0 is wall. So I can't move down; it's blocked.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, but I can choose a new direction, but with no instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on the next turn because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (4,1), so from (4,2) to (4,1). So possible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move U immediately. So I can move L, R, or D, but D is blocked by wall.\n> \n> Available moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,2)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,1)\n> \n> Now, (4,2) is the second position of the snake, so it's a body segment. But when I move, the snake moves, so if I move to (4,2), that's where the neck is, but after moving, the head will be there, and the body follows, so it might collide with itself.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions: head at (4,1), body at (4,2), (3,2), etc.\n> \n> If I move up to (4,2), that cell is currently occupied by the body. After the move, the head moves to (4,2), and then the body segments shift. The segment that was at (4,2) will move to where the head was? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment leaves its cell.\n> \n> So, if I move up to (4,2), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> After moving:\n> \n> - New head position: (4,2)\n> \n> - Then the body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where the head was, which is (4,1)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, say new_head.\n> \n> Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move in direction dir:\n> \n> - New_head = head + dir\n> \n> - New positions: [new_head, head, seg1, seg2, ..., all but tail] since tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,2), which is currently seg1 position.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,2)\n> \n> - Then seg1 (which was at (4,2)) moves to the old head position (4,1)\n> \n> - Then seg2 (at (3,2)) moves to old seg1 position (4,2)? No.\n> \n> Let's index:\n> \n> Let positions be P[0] = head = (4,1)\n> \n> P[1] = (4,2)\n> \n> P[2] = (3,2)\n> \n> P[3] = (3,3)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> If I move to (4,2), which is P[1].\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New P[0] = (4,2)  // new head\n> \n> - New P[1] = old P[0] = (4,1)  // this was head, now first body\n> \n> - New P[2] = old P[1] = (4,2)  // but (4,2) is now head, so P[2] is moving to (4,2), which is the new head position?

It's turn 80, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning that those are walls. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the snake can only be on (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But let's confirm the snake positions: head is at (3,1), which is x=3, y=1. y=1 is not y=0, so it should be playable. Similarly, (2,6) is given in food, and walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 should be fine. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable? But in snake positions, we have (2,6), and y=6 is not y=7, so it should be ok. Similarly, x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4). So all these have x from 2 to 5, y from 1 to 6, which are within 1 to 6 for x and y, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=1 is not a wall; walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 should be playable. But snake has positions like (3,1), x=3,y=1, and (2,6), x=2,y=6, etc., all seem fine.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which is left, so currently moving left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 4. But the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? In the input, it says (2,6,4,1) which I think means (x=2,y=6), life_span=4, value=1. Similarly, (4,4,6,1) is (x=4,y=4), life_span=6, value=1? Value=1 for all? Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 4, 1) - (4, 4, 6, 1) - (4, 5, 9, 1)\" and all have value 1, but one might be negative? No, it says value=1 for all, but in the core rules, there is negative food with value -1. Here all are value=1, so all positive food? But let's check: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the input it's written as (x,y, life_span, value), so for (2,6,4,1) it's x=2,y=6, life_span=4, value=1. Similarly, (4,4,6,1) value=1, (4,5,9,1) value=1. All have value=1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,6) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 80, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 83? Let's see: at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + N. But countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn t, countdown is N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1? For example, at turn t, life_span=N, it exists for N more turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (2,6): at turn 80, life_span=4, so it can be eaten on turns 80, 81, 82, 83? Turn 80: countdown=4, after turn 80, countdown=3, so at start of turn 81, countdown=3, and so on. It exists as long as countdown >0, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears, which is after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for turn t, with life_span N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1, and after N-1 more decreases, it reaches 0 and disappears. So it disappears at the beginning of turn t + N or end of turn t + N -1? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically in games, at turn t, the food is present, and after the turn, countdown decreases. So for eating, on turn t, if head moves to food, it eats it.\n> \n> After eating, the countdown decreases.\n> \n> For (2,6) at turn 80, life_span=4, so if not eaten, it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning at the end of turn 83 or start of turn 84? Let's assume that at the start of turn t, the food is there with countdown C, and after the turn, C decreases by 1. So for C=4 at turn 80, after turn 80, C=3; after turn 81, C=2; after turn 82, C=1; after turn 83, C=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 80,81,82,83.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,4) life_span=6, can be eaten from turn 80 to 85? Turn 80 C=6, after 80 C=5, ..., after 85 C=0 disappear? After turn 80: C=5, turn 81 C=4, ..., turn 85: at start C=1, after turn C=0 disappear. So can be eaten up to turn 85.\n> \n> Turn t with C=N: can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (2,6): N=4, turn 80, can be eaten turns 80-83.\n> \n> (4,4): N=6, turns 80-85.\n> \n> (4,5): N=9, turns 80-88.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list them in order.\n> \n> Head: (3,1), direction L (left), so last move was left to (3,1) from previous?

From (4,1) to (4,2) is south, but in positions, it's listed as (4,1) then (4,2), so the segment after head is (4,1), which was previous head, and (4,2) is next, so from (4,1) to (4,2) is down, then to (3,2) left, etc.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,1) — directly right of head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,2) — down from (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,2) — left from (4,2)?

For (2,1): not in snake positions, not in obstacles? Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) is not listed, so should be free?

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think at least 5 turns ahead. That means considering moves for turns 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, and beyond, but I should plan a sequence for a few turns.\n> \n> Current head position is (2,1), and direction is L (left). Since the head direction is L, I cannot move right on the next turn because of the no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (2,1) are up (U), down (D), or left (L), but not right (R).\n> \n> Let me list possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,2) – is this safe?\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,0) – but y=0 is a wall, so (2,0) is out of bounds. y=0 is a border wall, so I can't go there. The walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,0) is invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,1) – is this safe?\n> \n> - Right (R): but since current direction is L, moving R would be instant reverse, not allowed. So only U or L are possible? Down to (2,0) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Current position: (2,1). Possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (2,2)\n> \n> - Down: (2,0) – y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left: (1,1)\n> \n> - Right: (3,1) – but (3,1) is occupied by the second segment of the snake. Let's see the snake positions: head (2,1), then (3,1) is the next segment. So moving right to (3,1) would cause a body collision because the head would touch the body segment before it moves.\n> \n> Rule: body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception for the tail: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail because the tail will move forward, so it might be safe if that cell is the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving right to (3,1): (3,1) is occupied by the body, specifically the second segment. Since the snake moves, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail also moves, so the cell that was occupied might be free, but only if it's the tail.\n> \n> General movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail leaves its cell, making it free except for when new tail is grown after eating.\n> \n> But for collision: during the move, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment at that time, it collides, except if that cell is the current tail position and no food is eaten, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe only if you don't eat food, I think, because if you eat, the tail doesn't move, and you grow, so head and tail would be adjacent or something.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \" **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> But for movement, the collision rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" This implies that if you move to the tail cell and don't eat food, it's safe because the tail moves away, so no collision. If you do eat food, and it's the tail cell, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,1), is it the tail? Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,1) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 2: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 7: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 8: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 9: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 10: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 11: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 12: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 14: (4,5)  <-- this is the tail, since it's the last in the list.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> So tail is at (4,5). (3,1) is the second segment, not the tail.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (3,1) would cause a collision with the body segment at (3,1), since it's not the tail and the segment is still there when the head moves.\n> \n> After moving, the body segments shift, but at the moment of movement, if head moves to a cell occupied by any body part except the tail (which is about to move), it collides.\n> \n> Specifically, for cells that are not the tail, moving there causes collision because that body part is still there.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is safe to move to, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,1) is not the tail; it's a body segment. So moving right to (3,1) is invalid and causes death.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (2,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (2,2)\n> \n> - Left to (1,1)\n> \n> Now, is (1,1) safe? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, check if it's a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (1,1) is not listed as wall or obstacle. x=1, y=1, not on border, and not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,1) is not.\n> \n> (5,1) is obstacle, but (1,1) is different.\n> \n> So (1,1) should be free, but is it occupied by snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (1,1) is not in this list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): is it occupied? Not in the list, so empty.\n> \n> But (1,2) is an obstacle, so (1,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now for (2,2): (2,2) is not listed as snake position or obstacle. Snake has (2,1), (2,5), (2,6), but not (2,2). Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not mentioned, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): not snake, not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> So both (2,2) and (1,1) are possible moves from (2,1).\n> \n> But I need to think about the food and long-term.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (2,6): but (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake, at index 9: (2,6)\n> \n> Food at (2,6) with value 1, life span 3. But it's under the snake body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can *only be eaten* if:\n> 1. The body moves away, *and*\n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So since (2,6) is occupied by snake body, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is also occupied by the snake, tail at (4,5). Food at (4,5) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is food, not occupied? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), etc., not (4,4). So (4,4) is free and has food.\n> \n> Now, life spans: turn 81, so:\n> \n> - Food at (2,6): life span 3, disappears after 3 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 83? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t+N it is gone.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 81, life span 3, so after 3 turns: turn 81,82,83 it is present, gone at turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): life span 5, present turns 81 to 85, gone at 86.\n> \n> (4,5): life span 8, present turns 81 to 88, gone at 89.\n> \n> But (4,5) is currently occupied by the tail, so it can't be eaten until the tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,6), occupied by body segment.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (2,1), I can go up to (2,2) or left to (1,1).\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the head direction is L, so after moving, the new direction will affect next moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up to (2,2).\n> \n> Then head to (2,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then from (2,2), possible moves: up to (2,3), down to (2,1) but (2,1) is now the previous head position, but after move, the snake body: when head moves to (2,2), the tail might move or not, but since no food eaten, tail moves from (4,5) to the previous position, which is (5,5)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move up to (2,2), no food eaten, so new head is (2,2), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at (2,1) moves to where? When head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,2)\n> \n> Then body: the first body segment was at (3,1), but now it should be at the old head position (2,1)? Let's index.\n> \n> After move: head to (2,2)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (was at index 1, (3,1)) moves to old head position (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was (4,1)) moves to old segment 1 position (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 (was (4,2)) moves to old segment 2 position (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 (was (3,2)) moves to old segment 3 position (4,2)\n> \n> And so on, down to tail.\n> \n> Specifically, tail was at (4,5), moves to the position of the second last segment, which is (5,5), since (5,5) is index 13, tail index 14 moves to (5,5).\n> \n> So new tail at (5,5), and (4,5) is now empty? But food at (4,5) is still there, but not eaten since head didn't move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) still has food under it, but occupied? In new positions, (2,6) is still occupied by segment, let's see: from the list, after move, the segment that was at (2,6) might have moved.\n> \n> Old positions: index 9: (2,6)\n> \n> After move, segment that was index 8 (2,5) moves to? Index 8 was (2,5), it moves to the position of index 7? Better to list new positions.\n> \n> New snake after moving U to (2,2):\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Then: (2,1)  // old head, now body\n> \n> - Then: (3,1)  // old index1\n> \n> - Then: (4,1)  // old index2\n> \n> - Then: (4,2)  // old index3\n> \n> - Then: (3,2)  // old index4\n> \n> - Then: (3,3)  // old index5\n> \n> - Then: (3,4)  // old index6\n> \n> - Then: (3,5)  // old index7\n> \n> - Then: (2,5)  // old index8\n> \n> - Then: (2,6)  // old index9, but moved? Index 9 was (2,6), it moves to position of index 8, which is (2,5)? No.\n> \n> The positions shift: each segment i moves to the position that segment i-1 was at, for i from 1 to last.\n> \n> Segment 0 (head) moves to new position.\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was.\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment k moves to where segment k-1 was.\n> \n> For k segments, there are k+1 positions?

No, the snake keeps the same length if no food, but when moving, it grows only if eats food.\n> \n> Rule: when snake moves to a cell without food, it does not grow, so the tail is removed, so length decreases? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food, snake moves, head to new position, tail leaves its position, so the snake occupies a new set of cells, but the length remains the same because the tail moves forward, but in terms of grid, the cell count is the same unless it eats food.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> From the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" only when eating positive food.\n> \n> Otherwise, length unchanged.\n> \n> So when snake moves to a cell with no food, length unchanged, so the tail is removed, and head is added, so the set of cells changes, but the number of cells is the same.\n> \n> In this case, original snake has 15 cells.\n> \n> After moving to (2,3) with no food, the new snake has cells: new head (2,3), and the cells from old head to the penultimate segment, i.e., old positions 0 to 13, but old position 0 is (2,2), which is now the first body segment, and old position 14 is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (2,3) , (2,2) , (2,1) , (3,1) , (4,1) , (4,2) , (3,2) , (3,3) , (3,4) , (3,5) , (2,5) , (2,6) , (3,6) , (4,6) , (5,6) ] — that's 15 cells, but (5,6) was old position 13, and old position 14 (5,5) is removed, so the cells are from old 0 to 13 and new head, but old 0 to 13 is 14 cells, plus new head, 15 cells, but old position 13 is (5,6), which is now the tail, and it was not the tail before.\n> \n> Original tail was (5,5), now tail is (5,6), so the snake has moved, length unchanged at 15.\n> \n> Similarly, in new positions, (2,6) is still occupied, at index 11.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) is under the body.\n> \n> Now, for turn 83, head at (2,3), direction was U, so from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since last move was U, cannot move D.\n> \n> Last action was U, so for turn 83, cannot move D.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,4)\n> \n> - D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, and D is reverse, invalid anyway\n> \n> - L to (1,3)\n> \n> - R to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, (2,4): is it free?

No.\n> \n> Standard: when moving to a cell, if it's the tail, and no food, the tail moves away, so the cell is vacated, and head moves to it, but since it's the same cell, it might be a special case.\n> \n> Rule: \"the tail will also move forward\", so when head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves to the next position, but in this case, since it's the tail, and head moves to it, the tail cell is vacated, and head occupies it, so the snake has one less cell? But that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think there's confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: when snake moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, eat it, do not move tail, so snake grows.\n> \n> - If no food, move tail (remove it), and head moves to new cell.\n> \n> If the new cell is the current tail cell, then moving to it means that after move, the head is there, and the tail was there but is removed, so the cell is occupied by head now, and the previous tail is gone, so the snake has the same cells except the tail is replaced by head in that position, but it's the same position, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> For example, suppose tail at T, head moves to T, no food.

But that can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps in this implementation, moving to the tail cell is allowed only because the tail will move, but since the head is moving to it, the tail moves first or something.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when you move to the tail cell, the tail \"moves forward\" meaning it leaves that cell, and then head moves in, so no collision.\n> \n> But in terms of position, the tail cell is vacated, and head occupies it, but since it's the same cell, the snake effectively has one less segment because the tail is removed and head is at the same spot, but that would mean the snake disappears or something. That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps it's that the tail moves to the next segment's position, but in snake, the tail only moves when the head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify with an example.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head at H, body B, tail at T.\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell N, not food, then new head at N, body includes old H, and tail is removed, so new tail is the previous second last.\n> \n> If head moves to T, and T is tail, no food, then new head at T, and the old tail T is removed, but since new head is at T, it's occupied, and the previous position of T is gone, so the snake has lost a segment. But the length should remain the same if no food eaten.\n> \n> Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps when moving to tail, since tail moves, it's not there anymore, so head can move in without issue, and the snake length decreases by one? But the rule says \"length unchanged\" when no food, so it should not decrease.\n> \n> I think there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n> \n> Another way: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is not food, the tail is removed from its current position. If the new cell is the current tail position, then moving to it means that after the move, the head is at that position, and the tail has been removed, so the position is occupied by head, and since the tail was removed, the snake has one less segment. But the rule says \"length unchanged\" when no food, so length should stay the same, so this can't happen.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to the tail cell must be only possible if the tail is moving away, but in practice, for the head to move to the tail cell, it means that the snake is turning back on itself, which might be allowed only if it's the tail.\n> \n> But in terms of position, if head moves to tail, and no food, then new head at old tail position, and old tail is removed, so the cell is still occupied, but the snake has the same cells except the old tail is gone and head is there, but it's the same cell, so the set of cells has one less cell, so length decreases.\n> \n> But that contradicts \"length unchanged\".\n> \n> Perhaps the rule means that when no food is eaten, the length is unchanged, but the tail moves, so the number of segments is the same.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to tail, it's like the head and tail swap or something, but it's messy.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, in this game, moving to the tail cell is allowed and does not cause collision, and after the move, the tail is removed, and head is at that cell, so the snake has one less segment, but that can't be right because the rule says length unchanged.\n> \n> I think I should look for the core rules.\n> \n> \"Length of snake +1\" only when eating positive food.\n> \n> Otherwise, \"length of snake unchanged\".\n> \n> So when no food eaten, length unchanged.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell with no food, tail is removed, so the snake occupies the new head cell and all body cells except the tail is removed, so the number of cells is the same as before, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If the new cell is the current tail cell, then moving to it means that the new head position is the same as old tail position, so after move, that cell is occupied by head, and the old tail is gone, but since it was the same cell, the snake now has the cells from old head to penultimate, and the new head at old tail, so it's like the snake shifted, but the old tail position is now head, and the new tail is the penultimate, so length unchanged.\n> \n> For example, positions: ... A, B, T where T tail.\n> \n> Head at H, move to T.\n> \n> New head at T, body: H, A, B, ... up to the segment before T.\n> \n> T was tail, so the body is from old head to the segment before tail.\n> \n> Then new positions: new head at T, then old head H, then the rest of body except tail.\n> \n> So the new tail is the segment that was before T.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 87, from (1,6) to (2,6), (2,6) is tail.\n> \n> After move, new head at (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) and (2,5) is new tail.\n> \n> Length 16?

That means the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Current turn is 83. Snake positions: head at (2,3), then body segments down to (5,6). The head direction is Up, which means the snake was moving upwards to get to (2,3). From the positions: (2,2) to (2,3) is up, so direction U makes sense.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 3. Disappears in 3 turns, including this one.\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 6. Disappears in 6 turns.\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 9. Disappears in 9 turns.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them for clarity:\n> \n> Head: (2,3)\n> \n> Then: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,3) and direction is U. Since it's moving up, from (2,2) to (2,3), so for the next move, I can choose to go Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is U, so I cannot go D on the next turn. Possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, look at the food:\n> \n> - (2,6) is at position (2,6) with life span 1. It will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake! From the positions, (2,6) is the 12th segment? Let's count:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (2,6) is the 11th segment, which is part of the body. Food at (2,6) is under the body. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. But since this food has life span 1, it will disappear after this turn. So to eat it, I need to move the body away from (2,6) and then move the head to (2,6) on this turn, but that's impossible because the head is at (2,3), and (2,6) is three cells away; I can't reach it in one turn.\n> \n> The head moves one cell per turn. From (2,3) to (2,6) would require three moves: up, up, up. But life span is 1, so after this turn, it disappears. So I can't eat (2,6) this turn because I can't reach it in time. Moreover, it's under the body, so even if I could reach it, I need the body to move away first, which takes time.\n> \n> Specifically, to eat food under the body: the body must move away, freeing the cell, and then head moves to it. But here, life span 1 means it must happen this turn. But the head can't reach (2,6) from (2,3) in one move; it's too far. So (2,6) food is impossible to eat; it will disappear after this turn. So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Next food: (4,4) with life span 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns, meaning after turn 85? Let's see: current turn 83, life span 3, so it decreases each turn including current, so after turn 83, life span becomes 2; after turn 84, life span 1; after turn 85, it disappears. So I have until turn 85 to eat it, meaning I can eat it on turn 83, 84, or 85.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life span 6: disappears after turn 88? Current turn 83, life span 6: after turn 83, 5 left; after 84, 4; ... after 88, 0, so gone after turn 88. Can eat on turns 83 to 88.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 9: disappears after turn 91.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves this turn (turn 83): since direction U, I can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> - Up: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right: to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to check for collisions or dangers.\n> \n> First, what is at (2,4)? From snake positions, (2,4) is not listed. Positions: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), etc. (3,3) is segment 7, (3,4) segment 8. (2,4) is not occupied by snake; let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So (2,4) is empty. Similarly, (1,3) and (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> (3,3) is part of the body, so moving right to (3,3) would cause collision, since head touches body segment.\n> \n> Moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except for the tail, but the tail is at (5,6), so (3,3) is not tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But you can move into the tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,3), which is occupied, it's not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3): is it occupied? From positions, no (1,3) listed. Walls: internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) not mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> (1,3) is not a border wall? Borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (1,3) is within bounds.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (1,2) is an obstacle, so (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is one of them. \"Internal Obstacles: [(6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2)]\"\n> \n> Yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is wall.\n> \n> So for head at (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall (internal obstacle), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left to (1,3): (1,3) is not wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all listed, no (1,3), so free. But (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) is above it, should be ok.\n> \n> - Right to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by snake body segment 7, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Left to (1,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), move U to (2,4): (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move D: but current direction is U, and moving D would be instant reverse, not allowed. So D is not an option.\n> \n> Move L to (1,3): (1,3) is not wall, not snake body (snake is at (2,2), (2,1), etc., not (1,3)), so should be safe.\n> \n> Move R to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by snake segment, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible action this turn is L to (1,3).\n> \n> But that seems forced. I should think if it's safe.\n> \n> Moreover, after moving, the direction changes.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, turn 83: only choice is L to (1,3).\n> \n> Then snake head moves to (1,3), and direction becomes L (since I moved left).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: after moving, the head is at (1,3), and the body follows. The tail will move away from (5,6), so the new tail will be (4,6) or something, but the segments shift.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. Since no food eaten yet, length remains, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, since I'm moving to (1,3), not eating food, so snake grows? No, only if I eat food. When I eat positive food, length increases, meaning tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added. If no food, tail moves, so length same.\n> \n> Here, no food at (1,3), I assume. Food is at (2,6), (4,4), (4,5), (1,6). (1,3) has no food, so no eat, so tail moves.\n> \n> So after turn 83: head at (1,3), then body: the previous head position (2,3) becomes new neck, so positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) and tail was (5,6) but since no eat, tail moves to previous position of segment before, which is (4,6) was 13th, tail 14th moves to where 13th was, but it's a shift.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake was [H: (2,3), B1: (2,2), B2: (2,1), B3: (3,1), B4: (4,1), B5: (4,2), B6: (3,2), B7: (3,3), B8: (3,4), B9: (3,5), B10: (2,5), B11: (2,6), B12: (3,6), B13: (4,6), T: (5,6)]\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), no food, so tail is removed. New positions: head (1,3), then B1: old head (2,3), then B2: old B1 (2,2), B3: old B2 (2,1), B4: old B3 (3,1), B5: old B4 (4,1), B6: old B5 (4,2), B7: old B6 (3,2), B8: old B7 (3,3), B9: old B8 (3,4), B10: old B9 (3,5), B11: old B10 (2,5), B12: old B11 (2,6), B13: old B12 (3,6), and tail: old B13 (4,6). Old tail (5,6) is gone.\n> \n> So new snake: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, direction is L.\n> \n> Food: (2,6) food was not eaten, and life span 1, so after this turn, it disappears.

Let me list these out to visualize:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), I assume.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for (4,4), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, so on turn 87 or something? Let's see: current turn is 84, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N turns including this one.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is L, it starts at L and decreases by 1 each turn. When it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after L turns, meaning it can be eaten during the next L moves? Let's think.\n> \n> For example, at turn 84, food at (4,4) has life span 3. So:\n> \n> - Turn 84: life span 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 85: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 86: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 87: life span 0, disappears, cannot be eaten\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 84.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> Also, snake body occupies several cells. Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> That's 15 segments. So snake length is 15.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (4,4) – but (4,4) is occupied by snake? Snake has (3,4), (3,5), etc., but (4,4) is not listed. Snake positions: (3,4) is there, but (4,4) is not. Let's check:\n> \n> Snake: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So (4,4) is not occupied by snake; it's free. Similarly, (4,5) is not occupied; (3,5) is snake, but (4,5) is food. And (1,6) is food.\n> \n> (1,6) is also not in snake positions; snake has (2,6) and (3,6), but (1,6) is different.\n> \n> Now, current head at (1,3), direction L, so moving left. From (1,3), moving left would go to (0,3), but x=0 is wall, so that's invalid. Can't move left because it's wall.\n> \n> Head at (1,3), direction L, but x=1, so moving left to (0,3) is wall, so I need to change direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,3): adjacent cells.\n> \n> - Up: (1,4)\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) – but (1,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), so blocked.\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) – wall, blocked.\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by snake body, the second segment.\n> \n> (2,3) is the second segment of the snake. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because the body doesn't move away immediately.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, from (1,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) – is this free? Let's see what's at (1,4). Not in obstacles, not in snake? Snake positions: (1,3), (2,3), etc., no (1,4). So (1,4) should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) – but (1,2) is internal obstacle, so blocked, can't move there.\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) – wall, blocked.\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) – occupied by snake body (second segment). Since it's not the tail, moving there would collide and die.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,6), so (2,3) is not tail; it's the neck or something. So moving to (2,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Up to (1,4).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Grid: y increases up? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume.\n> \n> In coordinates, typically y=0 at bottom or top? But in this case, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> But for movement, U (x,y+1) means increasing y, which might be up or down depending on convention. But since it's grid, I'll assume y increases upward for simplicity, as per the movement definition.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – so y+1 is upward.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) – downward.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y)\n> \n> From (1,3):\n> \n> - U: (1,4)\n> \n> - D: (1,2) – obstacle\n> \n> - L: (0,3) – wall\n> \n> - R: (2,3) – snake body, not tail\n> \n> So only U is possible? But that seems risky if I have no choice, but let's see.\n> \n> (1,4) is free? Snake positions: no (1,4). Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) not listed. Food: not food. So yes, (1,4) is empty and free.\n> \n> So for turn 84, I must move Up to (1,4), since no other choice.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Current direction is L, but since I can't move L, I have to change, but the no instant reverse only applies to not moving opposite immediately after, but here I'm not moving, so I can choose any direction except possibly opposite, but since current is L, opposite is R, but R is not possible anyway.\n> \n> No instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So if current head direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn? Let me read.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> The phrasing: \"on next turn\" – I think it means that when I choose the action for the current turn, I cannot choose the opposite direction to the current movement direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as L, meaning the snake was moving left to reach (1,3), so current direction is left.\n> \n> Therefore, for the next move (turn 84), I cannot move right, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> But in this case, moving right is not possible anyway, so it's fine.\n> \n> I cannot move opposite, so for turn 84, since current direction is L, I cannot move R.\n> \n> But R is already invalid, so only U is possible.\n> \n> D is down, which is not opposite to L; opposite to L is R.\n> \n> L and R are horizontal opposites, U and D vertical.\n> \n> So current direction L, so I cannot move R.\n> \n> But R is invalid, so I move U.\n> \n> Then head moves to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake body will shift: head is now at (1,4), and the tail will move forward, so the segment at (4,6) will be removed, and a new segment added at head, but since no food eaten, length same.\n> \n> I didn't eat food, so tail moves, no growth.\n> \n> So new snake positions: after moving to (1,4), the body follows: the old head (1,3) becomes new first body segment, then (2,3), (2,2), etc., up to (4,6), but since no growth, the last segment (4,6) is removed.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: head (1,3), then body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — that's 15 positions.\n> \n> After moving U to (1,4):\n> \n> - New head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Then the previous head (1,3) becomes part of body\n> \n> - Then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> - The tail (4,6) is removed, so new positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> Now, (3,6) is the new tail.\n> \n> And direction is now U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Now, it's turn 85? No, turn 84 action is U, so after turn 84, state is as above.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to think from turn 84 onwards.\n> \n> Since at turn 84, only possible move is U, I must do that.\n> \n> Then for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n> \n> Also, food life spans decrease.\n> \n> At turn 84:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,4): life span 3, so after this turn, it will have life span 2?

It's turn 87, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, these cells are blocked and I must avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,6), and the body segments follow: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). The head direction is U, which is up. Since the head is at (1,6) and moving up, that would be to (1,7), but y=7 is a wall, so moving up is impossible because it's the border. y=7 is the top row, so from (1,6), moving up to (1,7) is invalid. That means I must change direction immediately.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, but since moving up is into a wall, I have to choose a different direction for this turn. The rules say I can choose to move in U, D, L, or R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse would be D. So I cannot move down immediately. Possible moves from (1,6) are: left to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Right to (2,6), is that possible? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Grid is from x=0 to x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. From (1,6):\n> \n> - Up: (1,7) - y=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (1,5) - but (1,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), etc. So (1,5) is the second segment, which is part of the body. Moving down to (1,5) would cause a collision with the body.\n> \n> Snake positions are a list: index 0 is head (1,6), index 1 is (1,5), which is directly below the head. So if I move down to (1,5), that's where the next segment is, so head would hit the body, collision, dead.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (0,6) is x=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> Right to (2,6). Is (2,6) occupied? Looking at snake positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). (2,6) is the last position listed. Snake positions end with (2,6), which is the tail? Let's list all positions in order:\n> \n> 1. (1,6) - head\n> \n> 2. (1,5)\n> \n> 3. (1,4)\n> \n> 4. (1,3)\n> \n> 5. (2,3)\n> \n> 6. (2,2)\n> \n> 7. (2,1)\n> \n> 8. (3,1)\n> \n> 9. (4,1)\n> \n> 10. (4,2)\n> \n> 11. (3,2)\n> \n> 12. (3,3)\n> \n> 13. (3,4)\n> \n> 14. (3,5)\n> \n> 15. (2,5)\n> \n> 16. (2,6) - this is the tail? Positions are from head to tail, so (2,6) is the last one, meaning tail is at (2,6).\n> \n> From head (1,6), moving right to (2,6). But (2,6) is occupied by the tail. However, the rule says: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward when I eat food or not. If I don't eat food, tail stays, but when I move, the tail moves.\n> \n> General snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But specifically, about moving to tail: the rules say \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail position is safe because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is the tail, so moving to (2,6) should be safe because after movement, the tail will be gone or moved.\n> \n> Let me confirm the snake length. Positions: 16 segments, so length 16.\n> \n> If I move right to (2,6), which is currently the tail, then after move, head is at (2,6), and since I didn't eat food, the tail is removed, so the new tail would be what was (1,5)?

No.\n> \n> Standard: new head goes to (2,6), then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (2,6)  // but (2,6) was the old tail\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at index 1, (1,5), moves to where? The segment at index 1 should go to the old position of index 0, which is (1,6)\n> \n> Similarly, index 2 goes to old index 1 position (1,5), and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> Since we moved to a position that was occupied, but it was the tail, and we didn't eat food, so the last position (the old tail position) is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to (2,6), which was the tail, now head is there. Then the body segment that was at (1,5) moves to (1,6), which was the old head. (1,4) moves to (1,5), and so on, down to the segment that was at (2,5) moves to (2,6)? Let's list indices.\n> \n> Assume positions indexed 0 to 15: pos[0] = (1,6), pos[1] = (1,5), pos[2] = (1,4), pos[3] = (1,3), pos[4] = (2,3), pos[5] = (2,2), pos[6] = (2,1), pos[7] = (3,1), pos[8] = (4,1), pos[9] = (4,2), pos[10] = (3,2), pos[11] = (3,3), pos[12] = (3,4), pos[13] = (3,5), pos[14] = (2,5), pos[15] = (2,6)\n> \n> After moving right to (2,6):\n> \n> - New head: (2,6)  // same as old pos[15]\n> \n> - Then new pos[1] = old pos[0] = (1,6)\n> \n> - New pos[2] = old pos[1] = (1,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - New pos[15] = old pos[14] = (2,5)\n> \n> But since no food eaten, the snake does not grow, so the last segment is removed.

Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,6), and the body follows: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5).

Head direction is given as R, but the position before head is (1,6), which is left of head (2,6), so the snake was moving left to reach (2,6)? I think I'm confusing the direction.\n> \n> The head direction is the current moving direction. It says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", meaning that on the previous move, it was moving right, so to (2,6). But the positions are listed with head first, so from turn 87 to 88, it moved to (2,6) with direction R.\n> \n> Now, for turn 88, I need to choose a new direction: U, D, L, or R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (2,6) are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or R (right, x+1). L is not allowed since reverse.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are occupied by snake and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

Let's see: snake positions include (2,5), which is the 15th in the list? Positions: index 0: (2,6), 1: (1,6), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (4,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,5), 15: (2,5)?

So snake length is 16.\n> \n> (2,5) is the last position, which is the tail. When the snake moves, the tail will move away if not eating, so moving to (2,5) might be possible if the tail moves first.\n> \n> General rule: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, and tail is removed unless eating food. So if not eating, the tail cell becomes empty.\n> \n> Therefore, from head at (2,6), moving to (2,5) is where the tail is. But after move, tail moves away, so (2,5) will be vacated, so it should be safe to move there, as long as no other body is there, but since tail moves, it's only occupied by tail, which leaves, so head can move to where tail was.\n> \n> Similarly, for other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, (2,5) is the tail, so moving down to (2,5) should be safe because after the move, the tail moves, and head is at (2,5), with new tail elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, other options:\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,6).

So these are walls that I can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). That's 16 segments. So the snake is pretty long.\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,5), life span 1, that means after turn 89, it will disappear. Since current turn is 89, if I don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 1: on turn 89, it has life span 1. After turn 89, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So to eat it, I need to move to (4,5) on turn 89.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) with value 1, life span 6. So it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 95 or something. Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 89, life span 6; after turn 89, it becomes 5; ... after turn 94, it becomes 0 and disappears before turn 95. So it can be eaten from turn 89 to 94.\n> \n> Another food: (4,6) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? Value is given, for (4,5) it's 1, (2,1) is 1, (4,6) is 1. But the description says \"Positive Food\" and \"Negative Food\", but here all have value 1, which should be positive. Negative food would have value -1, I think. But in this state, all food has value 1, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Food positions: (4,5,1,1) – I think this means (x,y,value,life_span), so (4,5) with value 1, life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1,6,1) – (2,1) with value 1? It says \"value2, life_span2\", but in the input it's written as ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (2,1) it's value 6? No, let's read:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\n> - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> - ( (x2,y2), value2, life_span2 )\"\n> \n> But in the text: for (2,1) it says \" (2, 1, 6, 1) \" – that might be a typo or misformatting. Looking back:\n> \n> \" - (4, 5, 1, 1)\n> - (2, 1, 6, 1)\n> - (4, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's meant to be: for (2,1), value is 1, life span is 6? But it says \"6,1\", which might be value 6 and life span 1? That doesn't make sense because food should have small values, and life span should be larger.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span). So (4,5) with value 1, life span 1; (2,1) with value 1, life span 6? But it says \"6,1\" – let's see the punctuation.\n> \n> It's written as: \" - (4, 5, 1, 1) \" so comma-separated, so (4,5,1,1) means x=4,y=5,value=1,life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1,6,1) – x=2,y=1,value=6,life_span=1? But value 6 for food? That seems odd, but possible. Or is it value 1 and life span 6? The format is ambiguous.\n> \n> Look at the first one: (4,5,1,1) – since value and life span are both numbers, and for (4,5) it's 1,1, which matches value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> For (2,1,6,1) – if it's (x,y,value,life_span), then value=6, life_span=1.\n> \n> But the description says \"value\" for food, and positive food is +1, negative is -1, but here it could be different values? The core rules say for positive food, reward value +1, for negative -1, but it doesn't say it can't have other values. In the input, it might have different values.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6,9,1) – value=9, life_span=1? That seems high.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a mistake in the input. Let me read the state again.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (4, 5, 1, 1)\n> - (2, 1, 6, 1)\n> - (4, 6, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> And it says \"Value and Life Span\", so I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) for each.\n> \n> But for (2,1), it's value=6, life_span=1; for (4,6), value=9, life_span=1.\n> \n> But that means both (2,1) and (4,6) have life span 1, so they disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> (2,1,6,1) – value=6, life_span=1; (4,6,9,1) value=9, life_span=1; and (4,5,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> All have life span 1, so they must be eaten this turn or they're gone.\n> \n> But the snake is at (3,6), head direction right.\n> \n> Current position: head at (3,6), moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction R, so I cannot move left (opposite) on the next turn. So possible moves from (3,6): up to (3,7), down to (3,5), right to (4,6), left to (2,6) but left is opposite to R, so not allowed because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is R, I cannot move L on this turn. So for turn t1=89, from (3,6), I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,6) is one cell right, so I can move right to (4,6) to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is at (4,5), which is down-right from head, but I can only move to adjacent cells. From (3,6), (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,7) up, (3,5) down, (4,6) right, (2,6) left but left not allowed.\n> \n> (4,5) is at x=4,y=5, head at (3,6), so not adjacent; to reach (4,5), I need to go to (4,6) or (3,5) first, but (4,5) is below (4,6) or right of (3,5), but not directly reachable from (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is far away.\n> \n> But all food has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, they disappear.\n> \n> (4,6) is directly reachable by moving right.\n> \n> (4,5) is not adjacent; (2,1) is far.\n> \n> So only (4,6) can be eaten this turn by moving right.\n> \n> But (4,6) has value 9, which is high, so eating it gives +9 score and snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has value 1, life span 1, but I can't reach it this turn from (3,6), so it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> (2,1) with value 6, also can't reach this turn.\n> \n> So only possible food to eat this turn is (4,6) by moving right.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks and plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls? Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: list of coordinates, head at (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> (2,1) is part of the snake body, but there is food at (2,1)? Food at (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1), it is under the snake body, so I need to have the body move away from (2,1) so it's free, then head can move to it to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> But for now, on turn 89, head at (3,6), moving to (4,6) would eat the food there, since (4,6) is not under body; let's see if (4,6) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: from the list, (4,6) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). No (4,6), so (4,6) is empty, and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is not in snake positions, so it's free with food.\n> \n> (2,1) is in snake positions; it's the 9th segment, counting from head: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,1), 9: (3,1), etc.\n> \n> So (2,1) is occupied by the snake body, and food is there, so it's under the body.\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Now, for turn 89, I can move to (4,6) to eat the food with value 9.\n> \n> But let's think about the consequences.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows to 17 segments. New head at (4,6), and the tail will move forward, so the last segment (3,5) will be removed, but since I ate food, a new segment is added, so the tail stays where it was before moving? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving, the head is at new position, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and if no food eaten, tail cell is vacated. If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,6) and eat, head now at (4,6), the body segments: the previous head (3,6) becomes body, so positions: new head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) and since I ate, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail was at (3,5), but after moving, the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where the next segment was, but since tail was (3,5), and it moves to (3,4)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Initial positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (2,6)\n> \n> 2: (1,6)\n> \n> 3: (1,5)\n> \n> 4: (1,4)\n> \n> 5: (1,3)\n> \n> 6: (2,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,2)\n> \n> 8: (2,1)\n> \n> 9: (3,1)\n> \n> 10: (4,1)\n> \n> 11: (4,2)\n> \n> 12: (3,2)\n> \n> 13: (3,3)\n> \n> 14: (3,4)\n> \n> 15: (3,5) tail\n> \n> After moving right to (4,6):\n> \n> New head at (4,6)\n> \n> Then the body segments: segment 0 moves to where head was, but since head moves, segment 1 moves to position of segment 0, segment 2 to segment 1, and so on, up to segment 15 moves to position of segment 14.\n> \n> Specifically: new position 0: (4,6)  // new head\n> \n> Position 1: (3,6)  // old head\n> \n> Position 2: (2,6)  // old pos 1\n> \n> Position 3: (1,6)  // old pos 2\n> \n> Position 4: (1,5)  // old pos 3\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position 15: (3,4)  // old pos 14\n> \n> Position 16: (3,5)  // new tail, since we ate food, so tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, after moving, the tail position is not removed, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So after moving without eating, positions would be: head at (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) and tail at (3,4), since the last segment (3,5) moved to (3,4).\n> \n> But since we eat food at (4,6), we add a new segment, so the tail stays at (3,5)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves by adding a new head position and removing the tail position, unless food is eaten, in which case we don't remove the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - If no eat: new head position, and remove tail position; body shifts.\n> \n> - If eat: new head position, body shifts, but tail position not removed, so new tail is the old second-to-last or something.\n> \n> After moving to (4,6) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Then the previous positions: the first body segment is at (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and since we ate, we keep the tail at (3,5), so now positions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — 17 segments.\n> \n> Old tail was (3,5), and it remains because we didn't remove it.\n> \n> In the shift, when head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the segment that was at index 15 (tail) would be removed if no eat, but with eat, it is not removed, so the new snake has the same segments plus the new head.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat:\n> \n> - New head at (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 (2,6)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Segment 15: old seg14 (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 16: old seg15 (3,5)  // not removed\n> \n> So yes, positions include (3,5) still.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) and (2,1) have life span 1, so after turn 89, if not eaten, they disappear.

Positions: index 0: (4,6) head, index 1: (3,6), index 2: (2,6), index 3: (1,6), index 4: (1,5), index 5: (1,4), index 6: (1,3), index 7: (2,3), index 8: (2,2), index 9: (2,1), index 10: (3,1), index 11: (4,1), index 12: (4,2), index 13: (3,2), index 14: (3,3), index 15: (3,4), index 16: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Tail is (3,5), and head is (4,6).\n> \n> Direction is R, so last move was right, from (3,6) to (4,6).\n> \n> Now food: only one food item: (2,1) with value 6 and life span 1? Let's see the input: \" (2, 1, 6, 1) \" – I think this means (x,y) = (2,1), value=6, life_span=1.\n> \n> In the food positions it says: \" (2, 1, 6, 1) \" – so (x,y) = (2,1), value=6, life_span=1.\n> \n> Value 6? That's unusual; usually food is +1 or -1, but here it says value=6. Let me check the core rules.\n> \n> Core rules say: Positive Food: Reward Value = +1, Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1. But here it's 6, which might be a mistake or special?\n> \n> In the state input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and here it's (2,1,6,1), so value=6, life_span=1.\n> \n> But core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. Perhaps this is a high-value food? Or maybe it's a typo. I should go with the input.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span=1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten, since countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (2,1). Looking at snake positions, (2,1) is occupied by the snake! Index 9: (2,1) is part of the snake body.\n> \n> Specifically, it's the 10th segment? Index 9: (2,1).\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, food is at (2,1), which is currently occupied by snake body at position index 9.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,1), and then head moves to (2,1).\n> \n> But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 90). That means if not eaten on this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> But can it be eaten on this turn?\n> \n> Currently, head is at (4,6), direction R. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction R, so moving left would be opposite, so not allowed. So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,6), so:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (4,7) is out of bounds or wall, deadly.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – is this playable? y=5, x=4. Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,5) should be ok, but internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – (4,5) not in that list, so yes, free.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) – x=5,y=6. x=5 between 1-6, y=6, but y=6 is not border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is playable. Internal obstacles? (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,6) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> y=6 is not border; border is y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is inside.\n> \n> Similarly, x=5 is inside.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,5) or R to (5,6). U is invalid, L is invalid due to reverse.\n> \n> L would be to (3,6), but (3,6) is the body, index 1, which is adjacent to head? Head at (4,6), body at (3,6), which is the neck, so moving left to (3,6) would cause collision because the body is there and it won't move away instantly? Rule: moving into body segment is deadly, except for the tail if it moves.\n> \n> Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but other body segments, not.\n> \n> Here, (3,6) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). (3,6) is index 1, which is the second segment. So moving to (3,6) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> Back to possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - seems free, but need to check if occupied. Snake positions: (4,5) not in list? Positions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc. No (4,5), so should be empty except possibly food, but food is at (2,1).\n> \n> Food at (2,1), not (4,5).\n> \n> - R: (5,6) - not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) - occupied by snake body, index 1, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D or R.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,1) with life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn. To eat it, head must move to (2,1) this turn, but head is at (4,6), too far. Impossible to eat this turn. So the food will disappear after turn 90, uneaten.\n> \n> Since life_span=1, and this is turn 90, after turn 90 it disappears. So no chance to eat it.\n> \n> But let's confirm life_span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so at turn t, if life_span=k, it will disappear after k turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+k-1, and gone at turn t+k.\n> \n> Standard countdown: if life_span=N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so at turn t, life_span=N; turn t+1, life_span=N-1; ... turn t+N-1, life_span=1; then after that, gone.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 90, food has life_span=1, so it is present only for turn 90. After turn 90, it disappears, so cannot be eaten later.\n> \n> Therefore, since head cannot reach (2,1) this turn, it will not be eaten. So we can ignore this food for now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan the next moves to maximize score, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells: all borders and these points.\n> \n> Playable cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Let me list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Now, tail is (3,5), and head is (4,6).\n> \n> Available moves from head: to (4,5) or (5,6)\n> \n> (4,5): down from (4,6)\n> \n> (5,6): right from (4,6)\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving down to (4,5).\n> \n> If move D to (4,5): new head position (4,5), then tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, and tail is removed if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten, so snake moves: new head at (4,5), body segments shift, so the tail (3,5) is removed, and new tail is the previous second last, which is (3,4)? Positions: after move, head at (4,5), then the body: the old head becomes new neck, so positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] and tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,6) head, after moving to (4,5), new head is (4,5), and the segment that was index 0 is now part of body, so new positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] so tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (5,6): new head (5,6), positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ] tail still (3,5)?

Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (1,6), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (4,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,4), 16: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving right to (5,6), new head at (5,6), then the body segments are the old positions from index 0 to 15, but shifted: new position 0: (5,6), position 1: old head (4,6), position 2: old index 1 (3,6), position 3: old index 2 (2,6), ..., up to position 16: old index 15 (3,4), and old tail (3,5) is removed.

It's turn 91, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, but there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,6), and it's moving right (direction R). The body segments follow: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> List of positions in order: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). That's 17 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 5. But (2,1) is occupied by the snake's body. Snake positions include (2,1), which is the 11th segment. So food at (2,1) is under the snake body.\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> Food at (2,1): position (2,1), value 1, life span 5. Since it's under the snake body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. But (2,1) is currently occupied by the snake, so it's covered.\n> \n> Food at (5,4): position (5,4), value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for food at (2,1), life span 5 at turn 91, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 96 it will be gone. Similarly, (5,4) has life span 10, disappears on turn 101.\n> \n> Current head direction is R (right), so from (5,6), moving right would go to (6,6). But (6,6) is not a wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, y=6 is playable. But let's check internal obstacles: (6,4) is an obstacle, but (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (6,6) is not an obstacle, so it should be movable.\n> \n> But (6,6) might be a border? No, borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is within 1 to 6, y=6 is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, since y=0 bottom, I assume.\n> \n> Coordinate system: typically in grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left? But here, walls are given as x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's a 8x8 grid with borders. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think? Let's see snake positions: (5,6) is head, which is x=5, y=6. Since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the top row. Similarly, (1,6) is top-left, etc.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, so y=1 to y=6 are rows 1 to 6, with y=6 being the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right, so x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head position (5,6) with direction R (right).\n> \n> Since direction is R, possible moves: not opposite, so cannot go L (left). Can go U (up), D (down), R (right). But U from (5,6) would be (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. D would be (5,5), which is down. R would be (6,6), which is right.\n> \n> y=6 is the top row, so U to y=7 is out of bounds, wall. D to y=5 is down, within bounds. R to x=6, y=6, which is within bounds.\n> \n> So from (5,6), possible actions: D (down to (5,5)), R (right to (6,6)).\n> \n> Cannot go U or L because U is wall, L is opposite direction? Direction is R, so L is opposite, which is not allowed. Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> But U is not opposite, but it's invalid because wall. So only D and R are possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves and their immediate safety.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (6,6)\n> \n> (6,6) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: head at (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> (6,6) is not in the list, and not a wall, so it's free. But after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food, otherwise, the tail moves.\n> \n> Currently no food at (6,6), so moving to (6,6) doesn't eat food, so snake moves, head to (6,6), and tail moves away from the last segment. Last segment is (3,4), so tail moves from there, so the cell (3,4) is vacated, but food might be there or not.\n> \n> After move, the new positions: head to (6,6), then body: previous head (5,6) becomes new body part, and so on, up to the second last, and tail (3,4) is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them. Head: index 0: (5,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,2), 10: (2,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (4,1), 13: (4,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (3,3), 16: (3,4)  // tail\n> \n> After moving to (6,6) without eating, new head: (6,6), new body: (5,6), (4,6), ..., up to (3,3), and tail becomes (3,3)? Let's see: the segment that was index 0 moves to (6,6), index 1 (4,6) becomes the new position for what was index 0, but since no growth, the tail is removed.\n> \n> After move, the new snake: head at new position, then the previous head, then previous body segments except the tail is removed. So positions: new head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // now (3,3) is the new tail, since (3,4) is removed.\n> \n> Previous tail was (3,4), removed.

Snake positions: no (5,5), not a wall.

But (2,1) is currently occupied by the snake body at position 10, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> The snake is long, 17 segments, so it might take time to uncover that food.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (3,4), and head at (5,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,4) and (5,6) are not adjacent; (3,4) to (4,4) or (3,5) etc would be adjacent, but (5,6) is two away.\n> \n> Distance: |5-3|=2, |6-4|=2, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should aim to eat the positive food.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is at (5,4), which is below (5,5) or left of (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,4), so (5,4) is accessible from (5,5) or (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n> \n> From current head (5,6), if I move down to (5,5), then from there I can go to (5,4) to eat the food, since (5,4) has food.\n> \n> (5,4) has food with value 1, and if I eat it, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving down to (5,5) at turn 91.\n> \n> Then at turn 92, head at (5,5), direction D.\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves: not opposite, so cannot go U (up, opposite to D), so can go D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (5,4) - which has food!

Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) should be free.\n> \n> But if I go to (5,4) at turn 92, I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (5,4), and since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (5,4), then previous head (5,5) becomes new body, then the previous body segments, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Current positions before turn 92: after turn 91 move to (5,5), positions are [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (3,3)] as above, with tail at (3,3).\n> \n> If I eat at (5,4) at turn 92, new head at (5,4), then (5,5) as new body part, then (5,6), (4,6), ..., up to (3,3), and the tail (3,3) remains, so the new tail is still (3,3) but now it's part of the body, and the segment before it is the new end? Let's think.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the tail stays, so the new snake has the head at food, the previous head becomes neck, and all body segments, with tail unchanged, so length +1.\n> \n> Positions: new head at food (5,4), then the previous positions from head to tail are kept, so body is now longer.\n> \n> After turn 91, if I moved to (5,5), positions: let's call S: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> At turn 92, if I move D to (5,4) and eat food, new head at (5,4), and the body remains, so new positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] with 18 segments, tail at (3,3)? The last is (3,3), but (3,2) is before it.\n> \n> In the list, (3,2) is at index 14 old, but after growth, tail should be the last, which is (3,3) in this case? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> New positions: head: (5,4), then previous head (5,5), then previous body (5,6), (4,6), ..., up to (3,2), and then the previous tail (3,3) is still there, so yes, tail is (3,3).\n> \n> But (3,3) was the tail before, and it stays, so now it's not tail anymore, the new tail is the one that was before, but in terms of position, (3,3) is occupied and is the last segment.\n> \n> In the list above, (3,3) is the 17th position in the new snake, so tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, after eating, I have the food at (5,4) consumed, so it disappears.\n> \n> Then I need to think further.\n> \n> But let's see the other option: if I move right to (6,6) at turn 91.\n> \n> Then at turn 92, head at (6,6), direction R.\n> \n> From (6,6), possible moves: cannot go L (opposite to R), can go U, D, R.\n> \n> U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.

But since the food has life span 10, from turn 91 to 101, so both are fine, but earlier is better? But not necessarily, since I need to think about risks and other food.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,1) has short life, only 5 turns, disappears at turn 96.\n> \n> But it's under the snake body at (2,1), which is a body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to move away so that (2,1) is vacated, then the head must move onto it.\n> \n> Currently at turn 91, (2,1) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (2,1) is index 10 in the list.\n> \n> When does (2,1) get vacated?

It's turn 92. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these as well.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,5), then body segments: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, so moving towards decreasing y. Since it's down, from (5,5) to (5,6) would be up? Let's clarify the coordinate system. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement U is (x,y+1), which might be up if y=0 is bottom, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,5), next is (5,6). Since head is at (5,5) and moving to (5,6), but head direction is D, which is down, so down should decrease y? I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – if y increases upwards, U is up; if y increases downwards, U is down. But in the state, head direction is D, and from the positions, head (5,5) to (5,6). If head was moving down to (5,5), previous head was at (5,6)? Let's see the positions: snake positions are listed as [(5,5), (5,6), ...] with (5,5) being head, so (5,6) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (5,6) on previous turn and moved down to (5,5). Head direction is the current direction it's facing, which is D, down.\n> \n> But movement U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1).

Walls at borders, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells? Let's see: x=0 wall, x=1 to x=6 are free, x=7 wall, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacles are present.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).

Walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (5,4) is within bounds, y=4>0, x=5<7. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle but (5,4) is different, so not obstacle. Snake body: is (5,4) occupied? Snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), etc., no (5,4), so it's free. And food is there.\n> \n> But moving to (5,4) would eat the food, since head moves onto it, and it's not under body currently.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is on a free cell, so eating it is straightforward.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (4,5): (4,5) is not in snake positions? Snake: (4,6), (4,1), (4,2), not (4,5). Obstacles: not listed, so free. No food there.\n> \n> Move R to (6,5): (6,5) — walls: x=6 is not x=7, so ok. y=5 ok. Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1) are obstacles, but (6,5) is not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (6,5), so free. No food.\n> \n> But (6,5) is adjacent to obstacle? (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different cell, so it should be accessible unless specified.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are specific cells, so (6,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,1) is under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away and head move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,1) is occupied by the snake body; it's the 12th segment or something.

When snake moves, depending on the direction, the tail moves to the next segment.\n> \n> But the food life span is 4, so it disappears after turn 92+4-1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 92, life span 4, then turn 93:3, turn 94:2, turn 95:1, turn 96:0, gone. So it can be eaten on turns 92 to 95 inclusive? When life span decreases to 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten while life span >0.\n> \n> Life span decreases at the end of turn or beginning? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn, if life span is L, it decreases during the turn, and after the turn, if L=1, it disappears, or something.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: when we say \"life span N\", it means it will disappear after N more turns. So on turn t, if life span is N, it can be eaten on turn t, and after that, life span becomes N-1 for next turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before or after the turn.\n> \n> The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that on turn t, with life span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1, and if L=1 before decrease, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, the food is present during the turn if L >0.\n> \n> So for food at (2,1), L=4 on turn 92, so it can be eaten on turn 92,93,94,95. On turn 96 it would be gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,4), L=9, so until turn 100.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate choice.\n> \n> From (5,5), I can move D to (5,4) to eat the food there immediately.\n> \n> But is it safe? Moving to (5,4) with food: since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new head at (5,4), and tail stays, so snake positions grow.\n> \n> Currently snake has 17 segments, after eating, 18 segments.\n> \n> Then I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5) without eating.\n> \n> But eating (5,4) gives +1 score and makes snake longer, which might be good, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), head at (5,4), and since I ate food, tail stays at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), possible moves: U (up to (5,5)), but (5,5) is where the neck was, but after move, the body will have moved?

Since it's turn 93, it will disappear after turn 95? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 3 at turn 93, it will be gone after turn 95. Let me clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

(2,1) is listed as a body segment. But there's also food at (2,1). Food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, (2,1) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, from the list, (2,1) is the 13th segment?

Snake positions: look at the list, (3,5) not in snake positions. Walls: not a border, and not internal obstacle.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Position of segments: seg0: (4,4), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (5,5), ..., seg12: (2,2), seg13: (2,1), seg14: (3,1), seg15: (4,1), seg16: (4,2)\n> \n> After a move, say head moves to new cell, say (4,3) if Down.\n> \n> Then new positions: head (new) at (4,3), then seg1 at old head (4,4), seg2 at old seg1 (4,5), seg3 at old seg2 (5,5), ..., and so on, up to seg16 at old seg15 (4,1).\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by seg13 (2,1) is now occupied by seg14? After move, seg14 is at old seg13 position (2,1), because seg14 moves to where seg13 was.\n> \n> Similarly, seg13 moves to where seg12 was, (2,2).\n> \n> So the cell (2,1) is still occupied by the snake, now by seg14.\n> \n> In fact, since the segments shift, the only cell that becomes free is the old tail position, (4,2) in this case, when the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for a body segment, when the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the food cell under a body segment remains occupied unless that segment is the tail and the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell with food under a non-tail segment, after the snake moves, that cell is now occupied by the next segment, so it's still under the body, not free.\n> \n> Only when the tail moves away and no segment is there, it becomes free.\n> \n> But for (2,1), it's not tail; tail is (4,2).\n> \n> To free (2,1), the snake needs to move so that the segment on (2,1) is the tail, and when it moves, (2,1) is freed.\n> \n> But currently, (2,1) is seg13, and there are segments after it: seg14,15,16.\n> \n> So it will take several moves for (2,1) to be the tail position.\n> \n> Let's see the tail part: the tail is at (4,2), and the path to (2,1) is from (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,2).\n> \n> So to make (2,1) the tail, the snake needs to move in a way that the tail shortens or something, but snake only shortens if not eating, but tail moves.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the segment at (2,1) will eventually be closer to tail.\n> \n> But to free the food at (2,1), we need the snake to move so that the body leaves that cell, which only happens when that cell is the tail cell and the snake moves without eating, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it's not tail, when snake moves, another segment takes its place.\n> \n> So for (2,1) to be eatable, it must be that at some point, the tail is at (2,1), and when the snake moves without eating, the tail leaves, freeing the cell, and then head can move to it later.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,2), and (2,1) is occupied by seg13.\n> \n> The distance from seg13 to tail is 3 segments (seg14,15,16), so it will take at least 3 moves for (2,1) to be the tail position, if the snake moves towards the tail or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose the snake moves without eating for several turns.\n> \n> Each move, the tail position changes.\n> \n> The segment that is at (2,1) will move to the next position each turn.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i-k, but since the list shifts, the cell (2,1) will be occupied by different segments.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move, seg14 is at (2,1)\n> \n> After two moves, seg15 is at (2,1)\n> \n> After three moves, seg16 (tail) is at (2,1)\n> \n> After four moves, if no eat, tail moves away, (2,1) is free.\n> \n> But life_span is short.\n> \n> Turn 94: countdown for (2,1) is 2, so after turn 94, countdown=1, after turn 95, countdown=0, disappears.

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,4) and (4,2) are two cells apart vertically, not adjacent. Adjacent would be (4,3) or (4,5), etc. So not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, let's consider possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Down to (4,3)\n> \n> - Left to (3,4)\n> \n> - Right to (5,4) which has food.\n> \n> If we move right to (5,4), we eat the food, so snake grows, length increases by 1. So after eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (5,4), then the previous segments: seg1 at (4,4), seg2 at (4,5), and so on, up to tail still at (4,2), but since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail stays, and we have one more segment.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the new position list: head at new position, then the previous positions, with tail unchanged, so length increases.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (5,4) and eating, positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (4,2), and now the tail is still (4,2), but since we grew, the segment that was tail is still there, and we add a new segment at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, after moving to food, the head is on food, it eats, so the tail does not move on this turn; the snake grows by one cell, so the new tail is the old tail, and we add a new segment at the position where tail was, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it consumes the food, and the tail remains in place, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, and all previous segments, with the tail not moving.\n> \n> So in this case, after eating at (5,4), positions become: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — now, since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so (4,2) is still there, and we have 18 segments: from (5,4) to (4,2) with 17 old segments but we add one, so 18 positions.\n> \n> Old positions had 17 cells, after moving, if no eat, we add new head and remove tail, so 17 cells. If eat, add new head, keep tail, so 18 cells.\n> \n> So here, after eating at (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), and direction was to Right, so new direction Right.\n> \n> But we have to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> If we don't eat now, we can go elsewhere.\n> \n> But (5,4) has life_span 7, so not urgent, but it's close.\n> \n> (6,6) has life_span 10, also not urgent.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (6,4) is an obstacle, which is adjacent to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, if we move right to (5,4), we eat, but then we are at (5,4), with obstacle at (6,4) to the right, so we cannot move right from there.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (5,4): after eating, head at (5,4), direction Right.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right?

It's turn 95, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there are internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). That's 18 segments. Let me count: positions from index 0 to 17, so 18 cells. Snake length is 18.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1, and (6,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1), it disappears after 1 turn, meaning if not eaten by turn 96, it's gone. Since current turn is 95, after this turn, on turn 96, if not eaten, it disappears. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 95, life span is 1, so it will be gone after turn 95 if not eaten? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1) with life span 1 at turn 95: after turn 95, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears. That means it must be eaten on turn 95 to be consumed, otherwise it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) has life span 9, so it will last until turn 95 + 9 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 95, life span is 9. After turn 95, it becomes 8, then 7, etc., so it disappears after turn 95 + 9 = 104? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. If N-1 > 0, it remains; if N-1 = 0, it disappears after turn t. So for (2,1), life span 1 at turn 95: after turn 95, countdown to 0, so it disappears. Must be eaten on turn 95 to get it.\n> \n> For (6,6), life span 9 at turn 95: after turn 95, it becomes 8, so it lasts until after turn 95 + 8 = 103? Disappears after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span given. Since countdown includes current turn, it will be present for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> For example, if N=1, it is only present on the current turn and disappears immediately after.\n> \n> If N=2, present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> So for (2,1): N=1, so only on turn 95, must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> For (6,6): N=9, so present from turn 95 to 103 (since after turn 103, countdown reaches 0), so can be eaten any turn from 95 to 103.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,4), direction R (right).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).

It's turn 96, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

The body segments follow: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). Let me list all positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Next: (5,4)  // since direction is down, this is the segment behind the head\n> \n> - Then: (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (2,6)\n> \n> - (1,6)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (1,3)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)  // tail\n> \n> The snake has 18 segments.\n> \n> Food: There's one food item at (6,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Since it's turn 96, and life span decreases each turn, including the current one, this food will disappear after 9 turns, so by turn 105.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The food is positive, +1, so eating it would increase length by 1. But I have to be careful about the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide. But in this case, the food is at (6,6), not on the tail.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,1), which is far from (6,6). So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

But cannot do instant reverse. Since current direction is down, reverse would be up. So I cannot move up immediately because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so moving down is forward, up is reverse, left and right are perpendicular.\n> \n> So allowed moves: Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). Not Up (U).\n> \n> Now, check the cells:\n> \n> - Down to (5,2): y=2, x=5. Is this within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is fine, x=5 is between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Check if (5,2) is occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so (5,2) is not a border cell. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is an obstacle, but (5,2) is not listed, so it should be free except for snake or food.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all snake cells: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> (2,2) is there, but (5,2) is not in the list, so (5,2) is empty.\n> \n> Food at (6,6), not (5,2).\n> \n> So (5,2) is free.\n> \n> - Left to (4,3): x=4, y=3. Not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), etc., not (4,3). Snake: (4,4) is snake, but (4,3) not listed. (1,3) is snake, but different cell. So (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Right to (6,3): x=6, y=3. Not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so should be free? (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is different. Snake positions: no (6,3), so free.\n> \n> But (6,3) might be near the obstacle.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (6,6). It's at (6,6), and head at (5,3). I need to get to (6,6) to eat it, but it has life span 9, so I have until turn 96+9=105 to eat it, which is 9 turns from now, including turn 96? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 96, life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 more turns, so on turn 105 it will be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life_span L, it will be present for L turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t+L or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically: at turn t, if life_span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases each turn, at turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1 it is L-1, ..., turn t+L-1 it is 1, and on turn t+L it is gone.\n> \n> So for food at (6,6) at turn 96 with life span 9: it will be there from turn 96 to 104, and disappear at turn 105.\n> \n> Turn 96: life span 9\n> \n> Turn 97: 8\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 104: 1\n> \n> Turn 105: gone.\n> \n> So I have until turn 104 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, distance from head (5,3) to food (6,6): Δx=1, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance |1| + |3| = 4. But since I need to move the head there, and the snake body moves, it's not direct.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to (6,6) without colliding and considering the body.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the tail grows, so I need space.\n> \n> Moreover, I should think about survival beyond that.\n> \n> But first, let's see possible moves now.\n> \n> Current position: head at (5,3), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down to (5,2)\n> \n> - Left to (4,3)\n> \n> - Right to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, check safety:\n> \n> (5,2): is it safe? Not a wall, not obstacle. Snake positions: (5,2) is not occupied now. But after moving, the tail will move, so I need to see if moving to (5,2) causes collision.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. The tail segment moves away, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, except if food is there, but no food there.\n> \n> Specifically, when snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - The last segment (tail) is removed, unless food is eaten, then tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But for collision: head should not collide with any body segment except the tail, but only if the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that will still be there after the move, it collides.\n> \n> After move, the new body positions: the segment that was behind head is now at head's old position, and so on, tail is gone.\n> \n> So for a move to be safe, the new head position should not be in the set of positions that will be occupied by the body after the move.\n> \n> The body after move: all segments except the tail will be in the positions from head old to one before tail.\n> \n> Let S be the snake positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to a new cell N:\n> \n> - New head: N\n> \n> - New body: [H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] where k is length, so if no food eaten, new body is [H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-2}], since tail T is removed.\n> \n> Positions: new positions are: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-2}]\n> \n> So the cells occupied after move are: N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-2}\n> \n> The head moves to N, which should not be equal to any of H, B1, ..., B_{k-2}, and also not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (5,2):\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> Length 18, so after move to (5,2), new positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,2)\n> \n> Then: (5,3) [old head], (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)  // tail (4,1) is removed, so last is (3,1)\n> \n> New body: from index 1 to 17 of current, which are (5,4) to (3,1), but (4,1) is tail, removed, so positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)\n> \n> (3,1) is the last now.\n> \n> Is (5,2) in the new body positions?

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 97 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 6, 8, 1)\n\t- (4, 1, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 97 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 97, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 8x8 since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list from head to tail: head is at (4,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> The snake head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,3) from the previous position. Since the previous position before head was (5,3), and it moved left from there to (4,3), that makes sense with direction L.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - One at (6,6) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - Another at (4,1) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and gives +1 score. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,6), it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn, so by turn 97 + 8 = 105 it's gone. Similarly, (4,1) disappears after 10 turns, by turn 107.\n> \n> I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and deadly.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are also deadly to touch.\n> \n> Snake body positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) — that's 18 segments, including head? Positions list has 18 elements: index 0 is head, 1 to 17 are body/tail.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> So, head at (4,3), tail at (3,1). Length 18.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,6) and (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is interesting because it's near the tail. Tail is at (3,1), so (4,1) is adjacent to tail? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> (3,1) is tail, (4,1) is food. Are they adjacent? (3,1) and (4,1) differ by x=1, y same, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But (4,1) is also an internal obstacle? No, obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) and (6,1) are obstacles, but (4,1) is not listed as obstacle, it's food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is food, not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,3), direction left. So from (4,3), possible moves: since direction is L, I can't instantly reverse to R, so I can go U, D, or L? No instant reverse means I can't go opposite to current direction, so current direction L, opposite is R, so I cannot move right on this turn. But I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,3)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): (x,y+1) = (4,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (4,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (3,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (5,3) but since current direction is L, moving R would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot move right.\n> \n> So valid moves from (4,3) are U to (4,4), D to (4,2), or L to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these cells are safe.\n> \n> First, (4,4): is this occupied by snake body? Looking at positions, (4,4) is the fourth position, which is a body segment. Specifically, after head (4,3), then (5,3), then (5,4), then (4,4). So (4,4) is occupied by snake body. Moving to (4,4) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3): let's see if (3,3) is occupied. Positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), ... (1,3) is the 13th position, (2,3) is 15th, let's list all positions to see.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> 0: (4,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (4,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,5)\n> \n> 6: (5,6)\n> \n> 7: (4,6)\n> \n> 8: (3,6)\n> \n> 9: (2,6)\n> \n> 10: (1,6)\n> \n> 11: (1,5)\n> \n> 12: (1,4)\n> \n> 13: (1,3)\n> \n> 14: (2,3)  // (2,3) is position 14? Let's count indices.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (1,6), 11: (1,5), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,3), 14: (2,3), 15: (2,2), 16: (2,1), 17: (3,1)\n> \n> So (3,3) is not in the list. (3,3) might be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is not in the list.\n> \n> (4,4) is index 3, occupied.\n> \n> (5,3) is index 1, occupied, but we're not moving there since right is invalid.\n> \n> So from (4,3):\n> \n> - U to (4,4): occupied by body, deadly.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): let's check if wall or obstacle. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. (4,2) x=4 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) not among them, so should be free? But is it occupied by snake? Positions don't have (4,2), so yes, free and safe to move, as long as not wall or body.\n> \n> - L to (3,3): similarly, (3,3) not border, not internal obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible safe moves: D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> I need to choose one and plan sequence for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> But I have to think about food and long-term survival.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) and (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is food, but it's near the tail. Tail is at (3,1), and (4,1) is adjacent.\n> \n> There's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,1), food at (4,1). Head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to tail (3,1). Distance: (4,3) to (3,1) is dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differing by 1.\n> \n> So head not adjacent to tail now.\n> \n> But if I move towards (4,1), I might become adjacent.\n> \n> (4,1) is food, so if I eat it, when I move to (4,1), the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn, but since I eat food, length increases, so new tail is the old tail, which was at (3,1), but after eating, the tail stays until next move? Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, so the new segment is added at head position, but since head moved, it occupies the food cell, and the body extends, so tail remains where it was.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: when head moves to food cell, the snake grows, so the new position list will have the food cell as new head, and the previous head becomes body, but tail doesn't move, so the tail segment stays, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position, freeing the cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the position where tail was or something? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail stays, and the snake grows by one. Then on subsequent moves, tail moves.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a non-food cell: new positions [new H, old H, B1, ..., up to second last, T is removed? No.\n> \n> Better: the head moves to a new position. If not food, the tail moves off its current position, so the new positions are [new head position, previous head, previous body1, ..., previous bodyN-1], so tail is removed.\n> \n> If it eats food, tail does not move, so new positions are [new head (food), previous head, previous body1, ..., previous bodyN-1, previous tail], so length increases by one, and tail is still there.\n> \n> In this case, when eating, the cell where tail was remains occupied because tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Now, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the head is on the food, and the new tail (which was the old tail) is adjacent, so they collide.\n> \n> But in this scenario, the food is on the tail cell? No, the food is at (4,1), tail is at (3,1). Different cells.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> The tail cell has food? But food is on a different cell.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> \"the tail cell has positive food\" — meaning, the cell where the tail is located has food on it? But food is a separate entity; it can be on a cell, but the tail might be there or not.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,1), tail at (3,1), so tail cell (3,1) does not have food; food is on (4,1).\n> \n> So for (4,1), if head moves there, it eats food, and since tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent, but the food is not on the tail cell, so it should be fine? The danger is only if the tail cell itself has food, meaning the food is under the tail.\n> \n> But here, food at (4,1) is not under tail; tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is food.\n> \n> Also, food can spawn under snake body, but only eaten when body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> But currently, (4,1) is not under snake; let's see if occupied.\n> \n> (4,1): is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: from list, (2,1) is there, (3,1), but not (4,1). So (4,1) is free and has food.\n> \n> (6,6) is also free, I think.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From head (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> I need to think about getting to food.\n> \n> First, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is directly below (4,2), so from (4,3), moving D to (4,2), then next turn I can move D to (4,1) to eat it, but I have to check if that's safe.\n> \n> (4,1) is food, and tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (4,1).\n> \n> If I move to (4,1), I eat the food, so snake grows. Head moves to (4,1), and since I ate, tail does not move, so tail remains at (3,1). Now, head at (4,1) and tail at (3,1) are adjacent, but since I just ate, the new length means that after this move, the positions include head at (4,1), previous head at (4,2)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current turn 97: head at (4,3)\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2): that's turn 97 action.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,2), but since no food, tail moves? Positions: new head at (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, and tail (3,1) moves off? Let's see the position list.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) ]\n> \n> After moving D to (4,2): since not food, head moves to (4,2), then the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,3), then (5,3) moves to (5,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard: the head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (4,2), then the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, (4,3), segment index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (5,3), and so on, down to the tail: the segment that was at index 17 (tail) moves to where index 16 was, (2,1).\n> \n> Let's list:\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then new body0 (previously head): (4,3)\n> \n> New body1 (previously index1): (5,3)  // moves to (4,3)? No.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: previous head position (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: previous segment 1 position (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 3: previous segment 2 position (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 4: previous segment 3 position (4,4)\n> \n> - New segment 5: previous segment 4 position (4,5)\n> \n> - New segment 6: previous segment 5 position (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment 7: previous segment 6 position (5,6)\n> \n> - New segment 8: previous segment 7 position (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 9: previous segment 8 position (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 10: previous segment 9 position (2,6)\n> \n> - New segment 11: previous segment 10 position (1,6)\n> \n> - New segment 12: previous segment 11 position (1,5)\n> \n> - New segment 13: previous segment 12 position (1,4)\n> \n> - New segment 14: previous segment 13 position (1,3)\n> \n> - New segment 15: previous segment 14 position (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 16: previous segment 15 position (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 17 (tail): previous segment 16 position (2,1)  // since segment 16 was at (2,1), and segment 17 was at (3,1), but segment 17 moves to where segment 16 was, (2,1).\n> \n> Previous segment 16 is at (2,1), so new segment 17 moves to (2,1), and the old tail at (3,1) is freed.\n> \n> So tail is now at (2,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,3): new head at (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), etc., tail to (2,1) or something.\n> \n> But back to food.\n> \n> If on turn 97 I move D to (4,2), then on turn 98, I can move D to (4,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> On turn 98, head at (4,2), I move D to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> Then after eating: head moves to (4,1), and since food eaten, no tail movement, so the new positions are: head at (4,1), then previous head (4,2), then all previous body segments as they were, and the tail remains, so previous tail at (2,1) is still there.\n> \n> Previous positions before move: after turn 97, positions are [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) ]  // tail at (2,1)\n> \n> Then move to (4,1) with food: new head at (4,1), then new body0: (4,2), new body1: (4,3), ..., up to new body17: (2,1), and since eating, add a new segment at the end, but where? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added, meaning the tail position is retained, so new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) ]  // length 19, tail at (2,1)\n> \n> Now, head at (4,1), tail at (2,1). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (2,1) are not adjacent; they are two apart. So no issue.\n> \n> But (4,1) is adjacent to (3,1)? (3,1) is not occupied now; in previous positions, (3,1) was tail but after turn 97 move, it moved to (2,1), so (3,1) is free.\n> \n> In the positions above, after eating at (4,1), the cells include (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., but not (3,1).

(5,1) is obstacle, which is adjacent to (4,1)? (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, (4,1) is x=4,y=1, so yes, adjacent, but that doesn't matter; the obstacle is at (5,1), not (4,1), so (4,1) is safe.\n> \n> (5,1) is an obstacle, so if I go to (5,1), I die, but (4,1) is fine.\n> \n> So eating (4,1) seems safe and gives +1 score.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (6,6), which has life span 8, so must be eaten by turn 105 (since turn 97 + 8 = 105, but life span decreases each turn including current, so after 8 turns it disappears.

(2,1) and (4,1) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart in x-direction.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,1) and (3,1), (5,1), (4,2), (4,0) but y=0 wall, so only (3,1), (5,1), (4,2).\n> \n> (5,1) is obstacle, so adjacent cells to (4,1) are: (3,1), (4,2) (since (5,1) wall, (4,0) wall).\n> \n> Now tail is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (4,1). (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1), (3,1), (2,2), (2,0) wall.\n> \n> (3,1) is adjacent to both, but tail is at (2,1), not at (3,1).\n> \n> So no issue with Tail Reward Danger here.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Food life span: (4,1) has life span 9, meaning it disappears after 9 turns, including this one, so if not eaten by turn 98+9=107, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 7, disappears after 7 turns, by turn 98+7=105.\n> \n> But turn 98 current, so if I eat now, it's fine.\n> \n> But I should consider the path.\n> \n> Also, moving down to (4,1) eats the food, but then what? After eating, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move this turn? No, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail stays in place; it doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Snake mechanics: normally, when you move, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from last cell if no food eaten. If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,1) and eat food, the new head is at (4,1), and the tail remains at (2,1) for this turn.\n> \n> Then next turn, the tail will move when we move again.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,1), the snake positions would be: head at (4,1), then the old head (4,2) becomes body, and so on, down to tail (2,1). But since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (2,1) with 19 segments.\n> \n> List: new head (4,1), then previous positions except tail stays: so the body segments from turn 98: positions 1 to 17 become positions 2 to 18, and position 18 (tail) stays, but since we add a new head, the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but tail doesn't move that step. So the tail cell remains occupied until the next move.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, the new position list is: [new head] + old positions except the tail is not removed.\n> \n> Old positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), ..., (2,1) ] 18 segments.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,1) and eating: new head at (4,1), so positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) ] that's 19 positions, with tail still at (2,1).\n> \n> Then next move, when we move, the tail will move away from (2,1) if we don't eat again.\n> \n> But for now, let's think about the immediate move.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,6) which is far away.\n> \n> But (4,1) is close and about to be eaten if I go down.\n> \n> But is it safe to go down?\n> \n> (4,1) is free, and moving there eats food.\n> \n> But let's see what happens after.\n> \n> After head at (4,1), direction is down? After moving, the head direction will be the direction I moved, so if I move down, new direction is D.\n> \n> Then from (4,1), possible moves: L, R, U, but not D? No, I can move to adjacent cells except reverse, but current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) to (4,2), because that would be reverse.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1), direction is D, so from there, I can move L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so not possible, or D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so impossible. Or U to (4,2) but that is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (4,1) has only three possible adjacent cells: (3,1), (5,1), (4,2). (5,1) is obstacle, (4,2) is body and also reverse direction, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,2) is now part of the body, so even if I could, it's collision, but since it's the first body segment, it might be ok if tail moves, but in this case, moving to (4,2) is reverse and also body collision.\n> \n> But specifically, since direction is D, moving U is reverse, forbidden.\n> \n> So from (4,1), only possible move is L to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is not occupied? Snake positions after eating: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., and (3,1) not in list. Obstacles: (1,2) but not (3,1), so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> So from (4,1), I must move left to (3,1), no choice.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), direction would be L, since I moved left.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), possible moves: U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,0) wall, (2,1), (4,1) but (4,1) is body, and moving right is reverse.\n> \n> (3,2): not in snake positions?

That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food: Only one food mentioned: (6,6) with value 6 and life span 1.

So if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 1: on turn 99, it will disappear after turn 99, meaning if not eaten on turn 99, it vanishes. Since we're at turn 99, we can eat it this turn if we move to (6,6).\n> \n> But the head is at (4,1), and (6,6) is far away. Current position: head (4,1), food at (6,6).
