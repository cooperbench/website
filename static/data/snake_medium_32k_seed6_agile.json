(1,6), value +1, life_span 1 (disappears after turn 10)\n2. (1,2), value +1, life_span 1 (disappears after turn 10)\n3. (1,1), value +1, life_span 7 (disappears after turn 16)\n4. (2,6), value +1, life_span 10 (disappears after turn 19)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 10\nFrom the head position (3,5) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (3,6) → Wall (internal obstacle at (3,6)) → Invalid\n- **D (Down)**: (3,4) → Free (no wall or body)\n- **R (Right)**: (4,5) → Wall (internal obstacle at (4,5)) → Invalid\n- **L (Left)**: (2,5) → Body segment → Collision → Invalid\n\n**Only valid move**: D (Down) to (3,4).\n\n### Consequences of Moving Down to (3,4)\n- **New Snake Positions**: Head at (3,4), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5)\n- **Direction**: Now D (Down)\n- **Food Update**: \n  - (1,6) and (1,2) disappear after turn 10 (not eaten).\n  - Remaining food: (1,1) and (2,6).\n\n### Next Moves (Planning Ahead)\nAfter moving to (3,4), the goal is to maximize score by safely eating food. The food at (2,6) is reachable and safer than (1,1), which is in a dead-end.\n\n**Plan to Eat (2,6)**:\n1. **Turn 11**: From (3,4), move L (Left) to (2,4). \n   - New positions: Head at (2,4), body at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n   - Direction: L (Left).\n2. **Turn 12**: From (2,4), move U (Up) to (2,5).\n   - New positions: Head at (2,5), body at (2,4), tail at (3,4).\n   - Direction: U (Up).\n3. **Turn 13**: From (2,5), move U (Up) to (2,6) and eat the food.\n   - New positions: Head at (2,6), body at (2,5), body at (2,4), tail at (3,4).\n   - Snake length increases by 1 (now 4 segments).\n   - Direction: U (Up).\n\n**Post-Eating Moves**:\n4. **Turn 14**: From (2,6), move L (Left) to (1,6).\n   - Only valid move (U: wall, D: body, R: wall).\n5. **Turn 15**: From (1,6), move D (Down) to (1,5).\n   - Only valid move (U: wall, L: wall, R: body).\n\n### Risks\n- After eating (2,6), the snake is forced into the top-left corner and will eventually get stuck (no escape after (1,1)). However, this is the only viable path to score points given the constraints.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven the immediate constraints and the need to maximize score, the best action is to move Down (D) at turn 10, initiating the sequence to eat (2,6). \n\n\\boxed{D}",

Moving Down allows the snake to reach it on turn 49.\n2. **Avoiding Traps**: Moving Up (U) risks trapping the snake near \\((5, 5)\\), leading to inevitable collisions. Down is safer for short-term survival.\n3. **Future Flexibility**: After eating \\((6, 2)\\), the snake can navigate leftward to open spaces, though long-term survival remains constrained by the snake's length and obstacles.\n\n### Action Sequence (Next Steps):\n- **Turn 49**: Move Down (D) to \\((6, 2)\\) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows).\n- Subsequent turns will involve left/down movements to avoid collisions (e.g., Left to \\((5, 2)\\) on turn 50).  \n\nThis choice balances immediate reward and survival, as other options lead to faster termination or missed opportunities.",
