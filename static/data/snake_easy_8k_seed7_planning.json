        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state:\n\n- Turn: t1 = 0\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n- Snake positions: Only one segment at (3,3). Since it's just one segment, the head and tail are the same.\n\n- Head direction: Left (L), so it's facing left.\n\n- Food:\n  - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n  - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n  - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1. Life span is 10 for all, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, it's just the head. Moving will grow the snake when it eats food.\n\nImportant rules:\n\n- Eating positive food: +1 score, length increases by 1.\n\n- Eating negative food: -1 score, length unchanged. But here all food is positive, so no issue.\n\n- Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. But currently, no food under snake since snake is at (3,3) and food at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6). (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, snake is at (3,3), so different positions.\n\n- Tail reward danger: If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But currently, tail is same as head, so after eating, if I eat, the tail will be where I ate, but since it's growing, let's see.\n\nSince snake is length 1, after eating, it will become length 2, with head at new position and tail at (3,3) or something. I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, I need to decide where to move on turn 0.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is L (left), I can move left, but I have to consider the no instant reverse rule. Current direction is L, so I cannot move right on the next turn, but since it's the first move, I can choose any except possibly opposite, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Let me read.\n\n\"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo on turn t, after moving, the direction changes, and I cannot move opposite to that on turn t+1.\n\nBut for turn 0, current direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, or R? But moving opposite would be R, since L is left, opposite is right.\n\nThe rule: \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R\"\n\nBut with constraint: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\n\"on next turn\" might be ambiguous. Let me read carefully.\n\n\" - **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nI think it means that from one turn to the next, you can't do a 180. So, after moving in a direction, the next move cannot be opposite to that direction.\n\nFor example, if I move left on turn t, then on turn t+1, I cannot move right.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up, I cannot move down next, etc.\n\nBut for the very first turn, I need to choose a move based on current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, or R? But moving R would be opposite to current direction, but since no move has been made yet, I think I can choose any direction, but the constraint applies after the move.\n\nThe state says \"Snake Head Direction: L\", which is the current direction before moving.\n\nWhen I choose to move, I can choose a direction, and after moving, that becomes the new direction for the next turn.\n\nThe no reverse constraint is for the next turn relative to the current turn after moving.\n\nFor turn 0, I can choose any move: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut if I choose R, that would be opposite to current L, but since it's the first move, it might be allowed, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", which might imply that for the current turn, I can choose, but let's see the wording.\n\n\"on next turn\" – this is confusing.\n\nI think it's better to interpret as: after each move, the direction is updated, and for the subsequent move, you cannot choose the opposite direction.\n\nSo for turn t, based on current direction, you choose a move, and after that, the new direction is set, and for turn t+1, you cannot choose opposite to that new direction.\n\nFor turn 0, current direction is L, so I can choose to move U, D, L, or R. If I move R, that is opposite to current, but since it's the choice for this turn, it should be fine, and then the new direction is R, so next turn I cannot move L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L, new direction L, cannot move R next.\n\nIf I move U or D, new direction U or D, cannot move D or U respectively next.\n\nBut moving opposite on the same turn might be allowed; the constraint is for the next turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nThe phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let me read exactly.\n\n\" - **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nI think \"on next turn\" refers to the action taken on the next turn.\n\nSo, on turn t, after moving, direction is D_t.\n\nThen on turn t+1, you cannot move opposite to D_t.\n\nFor turn t, when you choose the move, it can be any, including opposite to previous direction, but after that, for t+1, you cannot go back.\n\nIn this case, for turn 0, since no previous move, I can choose any direction.\n\nBut the current direction is given as L, so if I choose R, it's instant reverse, which might be forbidden.\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nLooking at the core rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\n\"on next turn\" – I think it means that the move on the next turn cannot be opposite to the current direction (which is the direction after the previous move).\n\nBut for the first turn, current direction is given, so if I move opposite on turn 0, it might be allowed, but let's assume that \"current direction\" is the direction before the move.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to assume that on any turn, you cannot choose a move that is opposite to the current head direction, to prevent instant reverse.\n\nBut the rule says \"on next turn\", which suggests the constraint is for the subsequent turn.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look for similar situations or think logically.\n\nIn Snake games, usually, you can't turn 180 instantly, so from current direction, you can only go left, right, or straight, not back.\n\nI think that's the intention.\n\nIn the rule, it says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", but \"on next turn\" might be a misnomer.\n\nPerhaps it's: you cannot make a move that is opposite to the current direction of the head.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll assume that on each turn, the possible moves are those that are not opposite to the current head direction.\n\nSo for turn 0, current direction L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R, because R is opposite to L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U, then new direction U, I can move L, R, or U, but not D, etc.\n\nYes, that makes sense with the \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n\nSo for now, current direction L, so possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right).\n\nNow, grid size: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are free, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake at (3,3), head direction L.\n\nFood at:\n- (1,1) value 1, life 10\n- (5,3) value 1, life 10\n- (5,6) value 1, life 10\n\nSince life span 10, and turn 0, so after 10 turns, they disappear, but since countdown decreases every turn including current, after turn 9, they might disappear? Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo for example, at turn t, food has life span L, at turn t+1, it has L-1, and so on, until L=1 at turn t, then after that turn, it disappears, I think. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t, and if L-1 = 0, it disappears before next turn.\n\nBut for eating, if I move onto it on turn t, I eat it before it disappears if L>0.\n\nLet's not worry about that for now, since life span is 10, plenty of time.\n\nFirst, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating any food will make it length 2.\n\nI should aim to eat food that is safe and leads to more opportunities.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3) with current direction L: U, D, L.\n\n- Move U (up): to (3,4)\n\n- Move D (down): to (3,2)\n\n- Move L (left): to (2,3)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the risks and rewards.\n\nFirst, where are the foods:\n\n- (1,1) is at top-left, but y=1, x=1, grid from y=0 to 7, so y=0 bottom? Usually in coordinates, y increases up or down?\n\nThe movement: U (x,y+1) , D (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the walls.\n\nBorder cells: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall.\n\nSo (1,1) is near bottom-left corner, since y=1 is just above bottom wall y=0.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, and (5,6) is x=5,y=6 near top.\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), that's towards (1,1) but not directly.\n\n(2,3) to (1,1) is not adjacent; (1,1) is two steps down and left, but I can only move one step at a time.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving L to (2,3), then I could go to (1,3) or (2,4) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), so from (2,3), I need to go down to (2,2) then left to (1,2) or something.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,3) is directly to the right at x=5,y=3, but I cannot move right because current direction L, and moving R is opposite, not allowed. So I cannot go directly to (5,3) now.\n\nFood at (5,6) is up-right.\n\nSince I can only move U, D, L from (3,3).\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nAssume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nFree cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (5,2).\n\nBut (1,1) is free, etc.\n\nNow snake at (3,3), head L.\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)\n\nAll value 1, life 10.\n\nI need to think about paths.\n\nAlso, since snake is short, I have space, but I need to avoid dead ends and plan for multiple eats.\n\nFirst, if I move L to (2,3), then I am closer to (1,1), but (1,1) is at (1,1), which is corner, so I need to go there carefully to not trap myself.\n\n(1,1) is adjacent to walls: west and south walls, so if I go there, I might have limited moves.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which has internal obstacle at (5,2) below it, but (5,2) is blocked, so from (5,3) I can move U, D, L, R, but D to (5,2) is wall, so only U, L, R possible, but R is to (6,3) which is near wall, x=6, not wall yet, x=7 is wall.\n\nx=6 is free, but adjacent to x=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is at y=6, near top wall y=7.\n\nNow, let's consider each move option for turn 0.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen new position: head at (2,3), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen snake length still 1.\n\nThen for next turn, I can move U, D, L from (2,3).\n\nIf I move L again, to (1,3), then from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2), or L but x=0 wall, so cannot move L.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3), I can go to (1,2), then to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut if I eat at (1,1), since it's positive, I grow to length 2, with head at (1,1), tail at (2,3) or something? Let's sequence.\n\nStart: turn 0, snake at (3,3), move L to (2,3). Now snake at [(2,3)], head direction L.\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), move D to (2,2). Snake at [(2,2)], direction D.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2). Snake at [(1,2)], direction L.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1). Now at (1,1), which has food, so eat it. Since value +1, score +1, snake grows to length 2. So after eating, head at (1,1), tail at (1,2)? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so positions: before move, snake at [(1,2)], move to (1,1), which has food, so after move, head at (1,1), and since it grew, the tail remains where it was, but before move, it was length 1, at (1,2), so after growing, segments: head at (1,1), and body at (1,2). So snake positions: [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nNow, head at (1,1), direction D (since I moved down to get there).\n\nNow from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, so collision, cannot. D to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot. L to (0,1), x=0 wall, cannot. R to (2,1), which is free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,1), tail moves from (1,2) to? When no eat, tail moves forward.\n\nAfter eating at turn 3, snake is [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move to (2,1). No food at (2,1), so head moves to (2,1), tail moves from (1,2) to... since it moved, the tail segment is removed, so new positions: head at (2,1), and the body segment was at (1,2), but since head moved, the tail is gone, so now snake at [(2,1)], length 1 again? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves off its position, so the body follows.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and body grows.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn 3, after moving to (1,1) and eating, snake positions: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), so two segments.\n\nTurn 4: I move to (2,1). (2,1) has no food, so head moves to (2,1), and the body segment at (1,2) moves to where the head was, (1,1). So now snake at [(2,1), (1,1)]\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (1,1).\n\nDirection: I moved R to (2,1), so direction R.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) which is tail, but tail is at (1,1), and moving there would be collision, or is it allowed?\n\nCollision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAh, important: you can move to the tail cell because when you move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSo from (2,1), head at (2,1), tail at (1,1).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), free. D to (2,0) wall, no. L to (1,1), which is tail, but since tail will move, it's ok, no collision. R to (3,1), free.\n\nSo I can move U, L, or R.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then head moves to (1,1), but (1,1) is currently occupied by tail. When I move, head goes to (1,1), and tail moves to... where? Positions: before move, snake at [(2,1), (1,1)]\n\nMove head to (1,1). Since (1,1) is where tail is, but after head moves to (1,1), the tail should move to the previous position of the body segment ahead, but there is only one body segment. The tail was at (1,1), and head moves to (1,1), but that would be same cell, collision.\n\nLet's think: the segments: index 0: head at (2,1), index 1: tail at (1,1)\n\nWhen moving, new head position: to (1,1) if move L.\n\nBut (1,1) is currently occupied by tail. After head moves to (1,1), the tail needs to move to where the head was? No.\n\nIn snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if head moves from (2,1) to (1,1), then the body segment that was at (1,1) must move, but to where? It should move to the previous head position, (2,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is the target, and it's occupied.\n\nTypically, if head moves to tail position, since tail moves away at the same time, it might be ok, but in terms of collision, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by tail, no collision.\n\nIn this case, head moving to (1,1), and tail moving from (1,1) to (2,1), so at the same time, head enters (1,1) and tail leaves, so no issue, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, the rule says you can move to tail cell.\n\nSo from (2,1), moving L to (1,1) is allowed, and after move, head at (1,1), tail at (2,1), since the body segment moves to (2,1).\n\nPositions: new head at (1,1), and the previous head position (2,1) becomes the new body, so snake at [(1,1), (2,1)]\n\nBut (1,1) had food earlier, but we ate it, so no food now.\n\nIn this path, I ended up back, but with snake length 2.\n\nBut in the process, I ate the food at (1,1) and got +1, but then I moved away, and now I'm at (1,1) again but with tail at (2,1), so I can move to (2,1) or other.\n\nBut this is messy, and I used several turns to eat one food and ended up in a corner.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then to reach (1,1), it takes multiple turns, and I risk getting stuck.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (3,4) from (3,3)\n\nThen new position (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nFood at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is up.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut there's food at (5,3) and (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is at same y, but x=5, I need to go right, but I cannot now because to go right from (3,4), but current direction U, so I can move U, D, L, R? Current direction after move is U, so for next turn, I can move U, L, R, but not D (down).\n\nBut to go to (5,3), I need to go right and down or something.\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, x=5, I am at (3,4), so I need to go right and down.\n\nBut down might not be immediately available.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (3,2) from (3,3)\n\nThen to (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,1), (4,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nFood at (5,3) is close, but (5,3) is at y=3, I am at y=2, so I can go up to (3,3) but that's where I came from, or right to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) has food, and I can reach it.\n\nLet's think about the food at (5,3). It's at (5,3), and there's an obstacle at (5,2), so from (5,3), moving down is blocked.\n\nAlso, snake is at (3,3), so to eat (5,3), I need to move right, but I cannot because current direction L, and moving R is opposite, not allowed on this turn.\n\nSo for turn 0, I cannot move to (4,3) or (5,3) directly.\n\nI need to change direction first.\n\nFor example, if I move U or D, then next turn I can move right.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,6), I need to go up.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to eat multiple foods.\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6).\n\n(5,3) and (5,6) are both at x=5, so I can eat both if I go there.\n\nBut (5,3) has obstacle below at (5,2), so it's a bit constrained.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is near top.\n\nAnother thing: life span 10, so I have time, but I should eat soon to grow and have more flexibility.\n\nBut with length 1, I can go anywhere.\n\nLet's list possible actions for turn 0:\n\n- Move L to (2,3)\n\n- Move U to (3,4)\n\n- Move D to (3,2)\n\nNow, I need to simulate each for 5 turns.\n\nFirst, suppose I move L to (2,3) on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), snake at [(2,3)], direction L.\n\nNow turn 1: from (2,3), direction L, can move U, D, L.\n\nIf I want to go to (1,1), I could move D to (2,2), as before.\n\nBut let's assume I go directly to food.\n\nTo eat (1,1), from (2,3), move D to (2,2) on turn 1.\n\nSnake at [(2,2)], direction D.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2). Snake at [(1,2)], direction L.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1). Eat food, grow to length 2. Snake at [(1,1), (1,2)] head direction D.\n\nNow turn 4: from (1,1), as before, only can move R to (2,1). Snake moves to [(2,1), (1,1)] head at (2,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1), can move U to (2,2), L to (1,1) but (1,1) is tail, can move to it, or R to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut now I'm in bottom-left, far from other foods at (5,3) and (5,6).\n\nTo reach them, I need to go right and up, which takes many turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move R to (3,1) on turn 5, then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is free, then to (5,1), but (5,1) is above obstacle? Obstacle at (5,2), so (5,1) is free, then to (5,2) is wall, cannot, so to (5,3), I need to go from (5,1) to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot, so from (4,1) I can go to (4,2), then to (5,2) obstacle, no, (5,2) is wall, so I cannot go directly to (5,3) from below because (5,2) blocked.\n\nFrom left or above.\n\n(5,3) can be accessed from (4,3), (5,4), or (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom my position at (2,1) after turn 5, I am at (2,1), to go to (5,3), I need to go to (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), then (5,3), for example.\n\n(4,2) is free? Walls: border and (5,2) obstacle, so (4,2) is free.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,3), then to (5,3).\n\nBut each move takes a turn, so from turn 5 at (2,1), turn 6 to (3,1), turn 7 to (4,1), turn 8 to (4,2), turn 9 to (4,3), turn 10 to (5,3) to eat, but food at (5,3) has life span 10, countdown from turn 0.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10, so at turn 1, life span 9, ..., at turn 10, life span 0, so it disappears after turn 10 or before?\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, before move, food has life span L, after move, if not eaten, L decreases by 1.\n\nIf L=1 at turn t, after move, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nIf eaten on turn t when L>0, it is eaten.\n\nFor (5,3), life span 10 at turn 0.\n\nAt turn 10, before move, life span=1, if I move onto it on turn 10, I eat it, then it is consumed.\n\nIf I move on turn 10, life span=1, I eat it, good.\n\nIf I move on turn 11, but after turn 10, if not eaten, it disappears, so on turn 11 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, life span=2, etc.\n\nIn this path, if I eat at turn 10, it's possible, but life span decreases, so on turn 10 it has 1 left, I can eat.\n\nBut I have to reach by turn 10.\n\nFrom above, at turn 5 I am at (2,1), to (5,3) is 3 steps right and 2 up, but not direct, need path.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (5,3), that's 4 moves, so from turn 5, turn 6: (3,1), turn 7: (4,1), turn 8: (4,2), turn 9: (4,3), turn 10: (5,3) eat.\n\nYes, on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,6) has same life, so at turn 10, it also has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nBut after eating (5,3) on turn 10, I am at (5,3) with snake grown, then I can go up to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) to eat on turn 13 or something, but (5,6) may disappear before.\n\nLife span 10 at turn 0, so at turn 10, (5,6) has life span 1, can be eaten on turn 10, but I'm not there.\n\nAt turn 10, (5,6) has life span 1, if I eat on turn 10, good, but I am at (5,3) on turn 10, not at (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, (5,3) at y=3, so I need to go up from (5,3) to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut from (5,3), moving up: U to (5,4), then U to (5,5), U to (5,6).\n\nTurn 10: at (5,3) after eating, snake positions, say length 2 or more.\n\nBut to reach (5,6) on turn 10, I need to be there on turn 10, but on turn 10 I am at (5,3), so I can move to (5,4) on turn 11, (5,5) turn 12, (5,6) turn 13, but on turn 13, (5,6) has life span 0? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span at turn 0: 10\n\nTurn 1:9\n\n...\n\nTurn 10:0? Countdown: at turn t, after the turn, life span decreases.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, food has life span L.\n\nAfter the snake moves on turn t, if the head is on food, it is eaten.\n\nThen, after the move, for all food not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0, if not eaten, L=9.\n\nAfter turn 1, L=8, and so on.\n\nAfter turn 9, L=1.\n\nAfter turn 10, if not eaten on turn 10, L=0, disappears.\n\nIf eaten on turn 10, when L=1 before decrease, it is eaten before decrease.\n\nSo for (5,6), to eat it, I must be on it on or before turn 10, because on turn 10, L=1, I can eat; on turn 11, it would be gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the path where I ate (1,1) on turn 3, then on turn 10 I can eat (5,3), as above.\n\nBut (5,6) on turn 10 I am at (5,3), so I can only reach (5,6) on turn 13, which is after turn 10, so (5,6) disappears after turn 10, cannot eat on turn 11 or later.\n\nSo I miss (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,1) first, I can only eat one food by turn 10, and miss the other two or one.\n\n(5,3) I can eat on turn 10, but (5,6) not.\n\nAnd (1,1) eaten early.\n\nSo only two foods eaten, but with many turns.\n\nNot optimal.\n\nNow, alternative: from turn 0, move D to (3,2).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), snake at [(3,2)], direction D.\n\nNow, food at (5,3) is close, at (5,3), which is east and north from (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), direction D, so I can move U, L, R, but not D (since D is down, opposite is U, but I can move U, L, R).\n\nCurrent direction after move is D, so for next turn, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nTo go to (5,3), I need to move right or up.\n\nSay on turn 1, move R to (4,2). Snake at [(4,2)], direction R.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3). (4,3) is free, no food, snake at [(4,3)], direction U.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3). (5,3) has food, eat it, grow to length 2. Snake at [(5,3), (4,3)] head direction R.\n\nNow, from (5,3), direction R, can move U, D, L, R? But D to (5,2) is wall, cannot. L to (4,3) is body, but (4,3) is body, so if I move L, head to (4,3) which is body, collision, cannot. R to (6,3), free. U to (5,4), free.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nSay move U to (5,4) on turn 4. Snake moves: head to (5,4), tail from (4,3) to where? When no eat, head to (5,4), body to (5,3), so snake at [(5,4), (5,3)].\n\nHead at (5,4), tail at (5,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4), not D (down).\n\nFood at (5,6) is at (5,6), so I can go up to (5,5), then (5,6).\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5), no food, snake to [(5,5), (5,4)] head U.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6), has food, eat, grow to length 3. Snake positions: head at (5,6), and since ate, tail stays, so body at (5,5), and tail at (5,4)? Before move, snake at [(5,5), (5,4)], head at (5,5).\n\nMove to (5,6), eat, so head to (5,6), new segment added, so positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (5,4).\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, (5,3) on turn 3 and (5,6) on turn 6, both within life span.\n\nLife span 10, turn 6 < 10, good.\n\nNow, I am at (5,6) with snake length 3.\n\nI can go for other food or explore.\n\nBut there is food at (1,1), which I can try to eat.\n\nFrom (5,6), I need to go to (1,1), which is far, but life span 10, on turn 6, (1,1) has life span 10 - 6 = 4? At turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0, L=9\n\nAfter turn 1, L=8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 5, L=5\n\nAfter turn 6, L=4, so before turn 7, L=4.\n\nI can reach (1,1) by moving left and down.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) head U, I can move L or R or U, but U to (5,7) is wall y=7, cannot, so move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, cannot move to body except tail.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nMove D to (5,5) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nMove L to (4,6), free.\n\nMove R to (6,6), free but near wall.\n\nSay move L to (4,6) on turn 7.\n\nSnake to [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? Head to (4,6), body to (5,6), tail to (5,5), but tail was (5,4), moves to (5,5).\n\nPositions: new head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, and tail moves to previous body (5,5), but (5,5) was body, now tail.\n\nSnake: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)] head at (4,6), tail at (5,5).\n\nThen continue to go left and down to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) life span: at turn 7, before move, L=4 for (1,1)? Life span decreases after each turn.\n\nAfter turn 6, L=4 for (1,1).\n\nAfter turn 7, if not eaten, L=3.\n\nTo reach (1,1) from (4,6) on turn 7, need to go to (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), then down to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). That's many moves, at least 7 moves (left 3, down 5, but not direct, min steps: from (4,6) to (1,1) is |4-1|=3 left, |6-1|=5 down, so 8 moves? Manhattan distance 8, but with obstacles, but no, so 8 moves.\n\nTurn 7 at (4,6), after move.\n\nTurn 8 to (3,6), turn 9 to (2,6), turn 10 to (1,6), turn 11 to (1,5), turn 12 to (1,4), turn 13 to (1,3), turn 14 to (1,2), turn 15 to (1,1). But on turn 15, (1,1) has life span: after turn 10, L=0 for (1,1)? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 0: L=10\n\nAfter turn 0: L=9\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9: L=1\n\nAfter turn 10: if not eaten on turn 10, L=0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 10, if I am on (1,1), I can eat, but I am at (1,6) on turn 10, not at (1,1).\n\nI reach (1,1) on turn 15, long after it disappeared.\n\nSo cannot eat (1,1) in this path.\n\nBut I ate two foods by turn 6.\n\nNow, back to turn 0, I moved D to (3,2).\n\nBut I could go for (5,6) first or something.\n\nAnother option: move U from (3,3) to (3,4).\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), snake at [(3,4)], direction U.\n\nThen from here, I can go to (5,6).\n\nFor example, turn 1: move R to (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), direction R.\n\n(5,4) no food, snake at [(5,4)].\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (5,5), no food.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,6), eat food, grow to length 2. Snake at [(5,6), (5,5)] head U.\n\nNow, I ate (5,6) on turn 4.\n\nThen I can go for (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,6), head U, can move L to (4,6), R to (6,6), D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, cannot, or U but y=7 wall, cannot U.\n\nSo move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nSay move L to (4,6) on turn 5. Snake to [(4,6), (5,6)] head L.\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (4,5), no food, snake to [(4,5), (4,6)] head D.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (4,4), no food.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,3), no food? (4,3) is free.\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (5,3), eat food, grow to length 3. Snake at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]? Before move, snake at [(4,3), (4,4)] head at (4,3) direction? When moving to (5,3), from (4,3) move R to (5,3), eat.\n\nBefore move, positions [(4,3), (4,4)] head (4,3) direction R (since moved right).\n\nAfter move to (5,3) eat, head (5,3), new segment, so body (4,3), tail (4,4)? Segments: head was (4,3), moves to (5,3), body was (4,4) moves to (4,3), but since ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), and tail remains (4,4)? No.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to new cell, new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays.\n\nBefore move: snake segments: index 0: head at (4,3), index 1: tail at (4,4)\n\nMove head to (5,3), which is food, so head now at (5,3), and a new segment is added at the tail position, so new segments: head (5,3), then the previous head becomes body: (4,3), and the tail remains (4,4), but now it's body, and new tail at (4,4)? No.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail position stays, and a new segment is added there.\n\nSo positions: the new head is at (5,3), the previous positions are all shifted, with a new segment at the previous tail position.\n\nSo before move: segments: [A, B] where A=(4,3), B=(4,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3) and eating: new head at (5,3), the body becomes A at (4,3), and since grew, a new segment is added at B, so tail at (4,4) still, but now there are three segments: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nFrom here, similar to before, I can move U or R, etc.\n\nBut I ate both (5,6) and (5,3) by turn 9.\n\nAnd (1,1) is still there, but far, and life span short.\n\nAfter turn 9, (1,1) has life span: after turn 9, L=1, so on turn 10, before move L=1, if I move to (1,1) I can eat, but I am at (5,3), too far, cannot reach in one turn.\n\nAfter turn 9, L=1, on turn 10 I can eat if I am there, but I can't, so it disappears after turn 10.\n\nSo I miss (1,1).\n\nBut in both cases, by going down or up first, I can eat two of the three foods.\n\nNow, if I move left first, I might only eat one or two if I go to (5,3) later.\n\nBut with move left, I ate (1,1) early and (5,3) on turn 10, but missed (5,6).\n\nWith move down or up, I eat the two at (5,3) and (5,6).\n\nBut (1,1) is missed.\n\nIs there a way to eat all three?\n\n(1,1) is far from the others, and life span 10, so from (3,3), to (1,1) takes min 4 moves: e.g., L to (2,3), D to (2,2), L to (1,2), D to (1,1) on turn 3 as before.\n\nThen from (1,1), to go to (5,3), min moves: from (1,1) to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) that's 6 moves, so from turn 3, turn 4 to (2,1), turn 5 to (3,1), turn 6 to (4,1), turn 7 to (4,2), turn 8 to (4,3), turn 9 to (5,3), eat on turn 9.\n\nLife span: (5,3) at turn 9, L=1 (since after turn 8, L=2? At turn 0 L=10, after turn 0 L=9, ..., after turn 8 L=2, before turn 9 L=2, after move on turn 9, if eaten, good, then L decreases to 1 but eaten so gone.\n\nOn turn 9, before move, L=2 for (5,3), I move to it, eat, then after move, L decreases to 1 but food is eaten, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) on turn 9, L=2, but I am at (5,3), to go to (5,6) need three moves up, turn 10 to (5,4), turn 11 to (5,5), turn 12 to (5,6), but on turn 12, (5,6) L=0? After turn 10, L=0 for (5,6), disappears, so on turn 11 or 12 not available. Cannot eat.\n\nSo I can eat (1,1) and (5,3), but not (5,6).\n\nIf I go to (5,6) first from start.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nThen to (5,6) as before, eat on turn 4.\n\nThen from there to (5,3), eat on turn 9 as above.\n\nThen (1,1) on turn 9, I am at (5,3), to (1,1) min 8 moves as before, cannot reach by turn 10.\n\nSo impossible to eat all three foods because they are on opposite sides and life span short.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat two of them.\n\nNow, which two? (5,3) and (5,6) are closer, I can eat both by turn 6 or so, as in the move D or U first.\n\n(1,1) is isolated.\n\nSo better to eat (5,3) and (5,6).\n\nNow, in the move D to (3,2) on turn 0, I can eat (5,3) on turn 3 and (5,6) on turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, move U to (3,4), eat (5,6) on turn 4 and (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nSlightly faster to eat (5,3) first then (5,6).\n\nBut with move U, I eat (5,6) faster.\n\nBut both ok.\n\nNow, with move D to (3,2), I start down, then right, then up to (5,3), then up to (5,6).\n\nWith move U to (3,4), I go up, then right to (5,4), then up to (5,6), then down to (5,3), but down from (5,6) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3), but (5,4) and (5,5) may be occupied when I go down.\n\nIn the U first path, after eating (5,6) on turn 4, I go to (4,6) or something, then down to (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), then to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nWhereas with D first, I go directly to (5,3) then up.\n\nShorter path for both with D first? With D first: turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 R to (4,2), turn 2 U to (4,3)? Earlier I did turn 1 R to (4,2), turn 2 U to (4,3), turn 3 R to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 4 U to (5,4), turn 5 U to (5,5), turn 6 U to (5,6) eat.\n\n6 turns for both.\n\nWith U first: turn 0 U to (3,4), turn 1 R to (4,4), turn 2 R to (5,4), turn 3 U to (5,5), turn 4 U to (5,6) eat. 4 turns for (5,6).\n\nThen to (5,3): from (5,6), say turn 5 L to (4,6), turn 6 D to (4,5), turn 7 D to (4,4), turn 8 D to (4,3), turn 9 R to (5,3) eat. 5 turns after, total 9 turns.\n\nWhereas with D first, both in 6 turns.\n\nSo D first is more efficient to eat both.\n\nMoreover, with D first, I start by moving down, which might be safer or something.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat two.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions from turn t1=0 to some turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions, I should output for, say, 5 turns or until I eat or something.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, back to the move: on turn 0, move D to (3,2).\n\nThen subsequent moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the direction for no reverse.\n\nAlso, in the path, when I am at (5,3) after eating, with body at (4,3), I move U to (5,4), etc., no issue.\n\nBut to output the actions, I should define the sequence.\n\nSince the food at (1,1) will expire, I might ignore it and after eating the two, I can explore or stay safe.\n\nBut for now, let's plan turn 0 to turn 5 or 6.\n\nIn the D move path:\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)  // from (3,3) to (3,2), direction D\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2)  // now at (4,2), direction R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3)  // to (4,3), direction U\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3)  // eat food, grow to length 2, positions head (5,3), body (4,3), direction R\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4)  // no food, head to (5,4), body to (5,3), tail gone? Snake to [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5)  // no food, to [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)  // eat food, grow to length 3\n\nBut the output should be actions, not states.\n\nAnd I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions from turn t1.\n\nt1=0, so output Turn 0: action, Turn 1: action, etc.\n\nHow many turns? At least 5, but since I have a plan, I can output until I eat both or something.\n\nBut to be concise, maybe 5 turns.\n\nIn 5 turns, with this, by turn 3 I eat first food, turn 6 second, but turn 6 is beyond 5.\n\nTurn 0 to 5 is 6 actions? Turn t1=0, then turn 0,1,2,3,4,5 for 6 turns.\n\nBut thinking 5+ turns ahead, outputting 5 actions might be fine, but let's see.\n\nI could choose to move U or D, but D seems better.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which is below (5,3), but in the path, I don't go there, so fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nBut on turn 0, moving D to (3,2), current direction was L, I move D, which is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed, new direction D.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2) move R to (4,2), current direction D, moving R is not opposite (opposite is U), so allowed, new direction R.\n\nTurn 2, move U to (4,3), current direction R, moving U is not opposite (opposite is L), so allowed, new direction U.\n\nTurn 3, move R to (5,3), current direction U, moving R is not opposite, allowed.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue, but for output, I think outputting 5 actions is sufficient, but since turn 3 I eat, turn 4 and 5 I move up.\n\nIn turn 3 I eat, so by turn 5 I am at (5,5), going to (5,6).\n\nBut to output, let's list from turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nBut on turn 5, I move U to (5,5), which is not eating, but moving towards food.\n\nPerhaps I can output until the actions are clear.\n\nSince the state has food with life 10, and I think ahead, but for answer, I need to specify actions.\n\nAnother move: what if I move L on turn 0? But that seems worse, as I might only eat one food.\n\nSo better to move D.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nSnake at (3,3), move D to (3,2): is (3,2) free? Walls: borders and (5,2) obstacle, so (3,2) is free, yes.\n\nThen to (4,2), free.\n\n(4,3) free, (5,3) has food.\n\nThen up to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nAll free except (5,2) wall, but not going there.\n\n(5,5) is free, etc.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIf I move U first to (3,4), then to (4,4), but (4,4) is free, then (5,4), then to (5,5), (5,6), eat on turn 4, then to go to (5,3), I need to go down, but from (5,6) I have to go around because (5,5) might be body if I go directly, but in the sequence, after eating at (5,6), if I go directly down, but (5,5) is body, so I cannot move D to (5,5), so I have to go left or right first.\n\nAs I did earlier, to (4,6) then down to (4,5), etc., longer.\n\nWhereas with D first, I can go directly up to (5,6) after (5,3).\n\nSo D first is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, move D.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 2: U (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 3: R (to (5,3), eat)\n\nThen turn 4: U (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (5,5))\n\nAnd then I can go to (5,6) on turn 6.\n\nBut for output, since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions (turns 0 to 4) or 6 actions (turns 0 to 5).\n\nTurn 0 to 5 is 6 turns.\n\nPerhaps output from turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, need to consider if there is risk, but in this path, no immediate risk.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here since no food under tail.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nBut turn 5: U to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nSince on turn 3 I eat, and turn 4 and 5 I move up.\n\nTo think ahead, after turn 5, I move U to (5,6) on turn 6 to eat.\n\nBut for output, I can do 5 turns or more.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify how many.\n\nIn the example, it might be open, but I think outputting for 5 steps is reasonable.\n\nSince turn 0 to turn 4 is 5 actions? Turn 0,1,2,3,4: 5 actions.\n\nTurn 0 to 5: 6 actions.\n\nBut let's see the state: current turn t1=0.\n\nOutput: Turn 0: action, Turn 1: action, ..., up to say Turn 5.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nTo be safe, I can output until the sequence is clear.\n\nBut in this case, with the actions above.\n\nPerhaps start with move D.\n\nBut is there a reason to move U? If I move U to (3,4), then I can go to (5,6) faster, but slower to (5,3).\n\nBut since I need to eat both, the D path is better.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,3) and (5,6) both at x=5, so by going to x=5, I can eat both vertically.\n\nWhereas (1,1) is out of way.\n\nSo I think D is best.\n\nTherefore, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves from the current state (turn 0) by simulating at least 5 turns ahead. The snake starts at (3,3) with direction left (L), and the goal is to eat the positive food at (5,3) and (5,6) efficiently, as they are closer and can both be eaten within the life span of 10 turns. The food at (1,1) is too far to reach safely without risking its expiration or missing the other foods, so it is deprioritized.\n\nMoving down (D) on turn 0 allows for a direct path to (5,3) by turn 3 and then to (5,6) by turn 6, eating both foods. This path avoids collisions, walls, and internal obstacles, and adheres to the no-instant-reverse rule. Moving up (U) or left (L) on turn 0 leads to suboptimal outcomes, such as missing one food or taking longer routes.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 0 to 5)\n- **Turn 0**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This moves towards (5,3) and positions the snake for efficient food collection. New direction: D.\n- **Turn 1**: Move right (R) to (4,2). Current direction D allows R (not opposite). Continues path to (5,3). New direction: R.\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (4,3). Current direction R allows U (not opposite). Approaches (5,3). New direction: U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (5,3). Current direction U allows R (not opposite). Eat food: +1 score, snake grows to length 2. New direction: R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to (5,4). Current direction R allows U (not opposite). No food, move towards (5,6). New direction: U.\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (5,5). Current direction U allows U. No food, continue to (5,6). New direction: U.\n\n### Reasoning and 5+ Turn Outlook\n- **By turn 6**: Move up (U) to (5,6) to eat the second food (+1 score, snake grows to length 3). This is achievable within the food life span (life span 10 at turn 0, eaten by turn 6).\n- **Risks avoided**: \n  - No wall or obstacle collisions: Path avoids x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n  - No body collisions: Snake segments do not overlap during movement (e.g., at (5,3), moving up avoids the body segment).\n  - Tail reward danger not applicable: No food under the tail during this sequence.\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 5, the snake can explore the grid (e.g., move left or right from (5,5)) to find new food or avoid dead ends. The priority is to stay in open areas and avoid corners.\n- **Why not other moves?**\n  - Moving left (L) on turn 0 leads to (1,1) by turn 3, but (5,6) expires before it can be reached.\n  - Moving up (U) on turn 0 reaches (5,6) by turn 4 but takes longer to reach (5,3) (turn 9), risking lower efficiency.\n\nThis sequence scores +2 by turn 6 and sets up for further growth with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 1: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 2: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",
