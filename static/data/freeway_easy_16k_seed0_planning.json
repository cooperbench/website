        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0, and I need to get to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we only care if x=0 is covered by a car on the same y-level at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you are only considered on the new y-level at the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you are on y at turn T, and then at turn T+1, you are on y+1. So you don't get hit by cars on y+1 at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t1=0. I need to find where the cars are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\n- First car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 12. Since direction is right, span is [tail, head] = [37,48] at t=0? No, let's read the car update.\n\nFor right-moving cars: at time t1, span is [τ, h], and at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nI think the format is (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut for right-moving, head is greater than tail, I assume.\n\nIn the first one: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12. Since direction right, at t=0, span is [tail, head] = [37,48]? But the update says for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ=37, h=48, so [37,48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12(T-0), 48 + 12T]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12. Span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T: [-11 + 12T, 0 + 12T] = [-11 + 12T, 12T]\n\nNow, collision on freeway 1 at time T if player is on y=1 and 0 is in the span of either car.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): one car (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? head=-48, tail=-95? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nτ is tail, h is head. So if direction right, head should be greater than tail, but here h=-48, τ=-95, and since -48 > -95, yes, head is right of tail.\n\nSpan at t=0: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): (48, 71, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t=1 is [h, τ], I think.\n\nUpdate says: left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head=48, tail=71? 71 is greater than 48, but if left-moving, head should be left, tail right? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the table, it's (head, tail, direction, speed) = (48, 71, left, 24)\n\nIf direction left, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ, but typically for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so if moving left, head should be less than tail? But here head=48, tail=71, so 48 < 71, so if moving left, head at 48, tail at 71, so span [48,71], and as it moves left, positions decrease.\n\nYes, so at t=0, span [h, τ] = [48,71] for this car.\n\nThen at time T: [48 - 24T, 71 - 24T]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): three cars\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12) — head=-48, tail=-59? -48 > -59, so for right-moving, span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12T, -48 + 12T]\n\nSecond: (-12, -23, right, 12) — head=-12, tail=-23, right, so span [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at t=0\n\nAt T: [-23 + 12T, -12 + 12T]\n\nThird: (24, 13, right, 12) — head=24, tail=13, right, span [13,24] at t=0? [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12T, 24 + 12T]\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): one car (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, right, span [37,48] at t=0\n\nAt T: [37 + 4T, 48 + 4T]\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): three cars\n\nFirst: (48, 37, right, 4) — same as above, span [37,48] at t0, [37+4T,48+4T] at T\n\nSecond: (12, 1, right, 4) — head=12, tail=1, right, span [1,12] at t0, [1+4T,12+4T] at T\n\nThird: (-24, -35, right, 4) — head=-24, tail=-35, right, span [-35,-24] at t0, [-35+4T,-24+4T] at T\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12) — same as freeway 1\n\nSpan for first: [37,48] at t0, [37+12T,48+12T] at T\n\nSecond: [-11,0] at t0, [-11+12T,12T] at T\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as freeway 1 and 7: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), so spans same as above.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=0. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. But we need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once we are at y=9, we are safe, and we need to be there at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), meaning when y=9, and since no freeway at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, to move up, we need to go to y=1, but we can only move at each turn.\n\nActions: at each turn, we choose U, D, or S, which changes y for the next position.\n\nLet me denote the turn: let t be the turn number, starting from t=0.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if player is on freeway y_t (so y_t between 1 and 8) and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at time t.\n\nNow, since we start at t=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since we need to move up 9 times, but we can move down or stay, so it might be more if we need to avoid cars.\n\nBut we can go directly up if possible, but likely there are cars blocking.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway is safe at position x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each time t, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at time t.\n\nOtherwise, unsafe.\n\nThen, the player must be on a freeway only when it is safe for that time.\n\nAlso, since we can move up or down, we might need to wait or change levels to avoid collisions.\n\nThe player path is a sequence of y positions over time.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nThen t=1, y1 = y0 + Δy0, etc.\n\nAt each t, for the position y_t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, it must be safe at time t.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t, so y_t =9 for some t.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach, so from t=0 to t=H-1, actions a_0 to a_{H-2}, and position at t=H-1 is y_{H-1} =9.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is updated after the action.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars at time t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nIf we are not on freeway, i.e., y_T=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need actions from t=t1=0 onwards.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and want to go to y=9, minimal actions would be 9 Ups, but we might need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time when x=0 is occupied.\n\nI need to find for each k and t, if there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nThen, the freeway k is unsafe at time t if occupied, safe otherwise.\n\nThen the player must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nNow, since the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when each freeway is blocked.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: \n\nCar A: (48,37,right,12), span at t: [37+12t, 48+12t]\n\n0 in span if 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t\n\nBut 37+12t <=0 and 0<=48+12t\n\nSince 37+12t <=0 implies t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but t>=0, so 37+12t >=37>0, so 0 < 37+12t, so 0 not in [37+12t, 48+12t] for t>=0. Similarly, 48+12t >0 always, but lower bound >0, so 0 not in this interval. So car A never covers x=0 for t>=0.\n\nCar B: (0,-11,right,12), span at t: [-11+12t, 0+12t] = [-11+12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span if -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\nWhich is -11+12t <=0 and 0<=12t\n\n0<=12t implies t>=0, always true for t>=0.\n\n-11+12t <=0 implies 12t <=11, t<=11/12 ≈0.9167\n\nSo for t=0: -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, -11<=0 true, so at t=0, 0 is in [-11,0], yes.\n\nFor t=1: -11+12=1, 12*1=12, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSo car B covers x=0 only at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, span [-11,0], and 0 is included, so yes.\n\nFor t>=1, not covered.\n\nSo on freeway 1, unsafe only at t=0?

Freeway y=1 at time t=1: we said safe for t>=1, yes.\n\nNow, from here, we can choose action for t=1.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=3 is unsafe?

Earlier: y=2 unsafe only at t=1.\n\nAt t=2, for freeway 2, span was [1,48] or something, not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, if we are on y=3, unsafe.\n\nBut if we are on y=2 at t=2, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 at time t=2: car span [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=2: unsafe, as span [0,23] covers 0.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nAt t=1, y=1.\n\nWe can choose to go to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAction at t=1: U, then y2=2.\n\nAt t=2, position y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=2: safe, as above.\n\nThen from here, if we go up to y=3 at t=3.\n\nAction at t=2: U, then y3=3.\n\nAt t=3, position y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=3: car span [48-24*3, 71-24*3] = [48-72, 71-72] = [-24,-1], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen go up to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAction at t=3: U, then y4=4.\n\nAt t=4, position y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=4: unsafe, because of first car, span [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], covers 0. Also, other cars not at issue, but this one does.\n\nSo unsafe at t=4.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=3.\n\nInstead of going up to y=4 at t=4, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nWe could delay going to y=4.\n\nFor example, at t=3, action S: stay, then y4=3.\n\nAt t=4, position y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=4: span [48-24*4, 71-24*4] = [48-96, 71-96] = [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut we are still at y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, action U to go to y=4 at t=5.\n\nAction at t=4: U, then y5=4.\n\nAt t=5, position y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=5: is it safe?\n\nEarlier, y=4 unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nAt t=5: first car span [-59+12*5, -48+12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car not at t=5, only t=1.\n\nThird car never.\n\nSo safe at t=5.\n\nGood.\n\nThen from here, we can go up to y=5 at t=6.\n\nAction at t=5: U, then y6=5.\n\nAt t=6, position y=5.\n\ny=5 always safe, good.\n\nThen go to y=6 at t=7? Action at t=6: U, then y7=6.\n\nAt t=7, position y=6.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=7, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nNeed to avoid y=6 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, we are at y=5.\n\nIf we go to y=6 at t=7, but at t=7, y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=5, action S at t=6, then y7=5.\n\nAt t=7, position y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, action? If we go to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAction at t=7: U, then y8=6.\n\nAt t=8, position y=6.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=8? At t=8, span [-3,8] or something, covers 0, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6,7,8 all unsafe.\n\nSo if we go to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay longer at y=5.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if we stay, y8=5.\n\nAt t=8, position y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action U to y=9? But y=6 to y=7? Let's see.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, so to move up, we go to next y.\n\nFrom y=5, if we go up, to y=6.\n\nBut at t=8, if we are at y=5, and action U, then y9=6.\n\nAt t=9, position y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 at t=9: is it safe?\n\nEarlier, for freeway 6, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=9: third car span [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=7 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list the path we have so far.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\na0: U → t=1, y=1\n\na1: U → t=2, y=2\n\na2: U → t=3, y=3\n\nBut at t=3, we need to avoid going to y=4 at t=4.\n\nIn my earlier plan, at t=3, I stayed: a3: S → t=4, y=3\n\nThen a4: U → t=5, y=4\n\nThen a5: U → t=6, y=5\n\nNow at t=6, y=5\n\nIf we go up: a6: U → t=7, y=6 but unsafe at t=7\n\nSo instead, a6: S → t=7, y=5\n\nThen a7: S or U? If a7: U → t=8, y=6 but unsafe at t=8\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo a7: S → t=8, y=5\n\nThen a8: U → t=9, y=6 (since y6=5? Positions: at t=6, y=5; t=7, if S, y=5; t=8, if S, y=5; then a8: U → t=9, y=6)\n\nAt t=9, y=6, which is safe as above.\n\nThen from here, go to y=7 at t=10: a9: U → t=10, y=7\n\nAt t=10, y=7, freeway 7 safe for t>=1, yes.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=11: a10: U → t=11, y=8\n\nAt t=11, y=8, freeway 8 safe for t>=1, yes.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12: a11: U → t=12, y=9\n\nReached at t=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? We have delays.\n\nWe could go to y=5 earlier and wait less.\n\nIn the path above, we reached y=5 at t=6, but we stayed at y=5 for t=6,7,8, and moved to y=6 at t=9.\n\ny=6 is unsafe from t=6 to t=8, so we have to be at y=6 only from t=9 onwards.\n\nt=9 is the first safe time for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, we were at t=5, which is after t=4 unsafe.\n\nBut we could have gone faster to y=5.\n\nFrom start, we went to y=1 at t=1, y=2 at t=2, y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen instead of staying at t=3, we could go directly to y=4 but at t=4 unsafe, so we stayed.\n\nBut at t=3, we are at y=3, and we need to be at y=4 not at t=4.\n\nThe next safe time for y=4 is t=5, since unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nt=1 is past, so t=5 is next safe.\n\nSimilarly, we could go from y=3 to y=4 at t=5 directly? But to be at y=4 at t=5, we need to arrive at t=5.\n\nIf at t=3, we are at y=3, and we want to be at y=4 at time t=5.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAt t=3, if we go up, we are at y=4 at t=4, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at t=3, we are at y=3 at t=4, then go up to y=4 at t=5.\n\nWe could go down, but that might not help.\n\nSo we have to stay or move, but moving down delays more.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nSimilarly, at y=5, we have to wait until t=9 to go to y=6, since before that unsafe.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so we can be at y=6 only from t=9 onwards.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=9, we need to be at y=5 at some point before.\n\nSince we move one step, if we are at y=5 at t=8, then action U at t=8 to y=6 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be at y=5 at t=8.\n\nBut y=5 is always safe, so we can be there.\n\nIn the earlier path, we were at y=5 from t=6 onwards, but we stayed until t=8.\n\nWe could reach y=5 earlier.\n\nHow early can we reach y=5?\n\nFrom start, minimal to y=5 is 5 turns: U,U,U,U,U to t=5 y=5.\n\nBut let's see if we can.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, a0:U → t=1 y=1\n\na1:U → t=2 y=2\n\nBut at t=2, if we go to y=3? a2:U → t=3 y=3\n\nThen a3:U → t=4 y=4, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=4 at t=4.\n\nThus, at t=3, we cannot go up, must stay or down.\n\nIf stay, a3:S → t=4 y=3\n\nThen a4:U → t=5 y=4 safe.\n\nThen a5:U → t=6 y=5.\n\nNow, at t=6, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=6, but not at t=6,7,8.\n\nFirst safe at t=9.\n\nSo we must be at y=5 or lower until we can go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=6 at t=9, we need to be at y=5 at t=8 or earlier, and take action U at t=8.\n\nSince y=5 safe, we can stay at y=5 from t=6 to t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, action U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=7, y=8, y=9.\n\nBut we can go directly.\n\nNow, the path:\n\nt=0, y=0\n\na0: U → t=1, y=1\n\na1: U → t=2, y=2\n\na2: U → t=3, y=3\n\na3: S → t=4, y=3  (avoid y=4 at t=4)\n\na4: U → t=5, y=4\n\na5: U → t=6, y=5\n\nNow, at t=6, y=5\n\na6: S → t=7, y=5  (stay to avoid y=6)\n\na7: S → t=8, y=5  (stay)\n\na8: U → t=9, y=6  (now safe)\n\na9: U → t=10, y=7\n\na10: U → t=11, y=8\n\na11: U → t=12, y=9\n\nReached at t=12.\n\nBut we have two stays: at t=3 and t=6,t=7? a6 and a7 are both S, so two stays at y=5.\n\na3 is one stay at y=3.\n\nNow, is there a way to save time?\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=3, can we go to y=5 faster?\n\nBut y=4 must be avoided at t=4, so we have to delay.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 via different path.\n\nFor example, go to y=1, then stay or something, but y=1 is safe after t=0.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is always safe, we can go directly to y=5, but we have to pass through y=1,2,3,4.\n\nWe cannot skip levels.\n\nMust move step by step.\n\nPerhaps at t=2, instead of going to y=3, we could go down or stay, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=1, if we stay: a1:S → t=2 y=1\n\nThen at t=2, we can go to y=2? a2:U → t=3 y=2\n\nBut at t=3, y=2 is safe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at t=1, at t=3: span [-95+48*3, -48+48*3] = [-95+144, -48+144] = [49,96], no 0, safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=3, we can go to y=3 at t=4.\n\na3:U → t=4 y=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3: freeway 3 at t=4: span [48-96,71-96]=[-48,-25], safe.\n\nThen go to y=4 at t=5: a4:U → t=5 y=4, safe as before.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=6: a5:U → t=6 y=5.\n\nSame as before, reached y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen same issue with y=6.\n\nIn this path, we have:\n\nt=0 y=0\n\na0:U → t=1 y=1\n\na1:S → t=2 y=1 (stayed at y=1)\n\na2:U → t=3 y=2\n\na3:U → t=4 y=3\n\na4:U → t=5 y=4\n\na5:U → t=6 y=5\n\nNow at t=6 y=5, same as before.\n\nWe reached y=5 at t=6, same as previous path.\n\nIn the first path, we had y=3 at t=3 and stayed, then y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6.\n\nHere, we have y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6, so y=5 at same time.\n\nBut in this case, we used a stay at y=1 instead of going directly.\n\nBut we still need to deal with y=6.\n\nNow, with y=6 unsafe from t=6 to t=8, we have to be at y=6 at t=9 or later.\n\nSo we need to be at y=5 at least until t=8 to go up at t=8.\n\nSince we are at y=5 at t=6, we stay at t=6,7,8: a6:S, a7:S, a8:U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut we can go to y=6 earlier? No, because t=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6 at t=5 or earlier, but t=5: y=6 at t=5, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 at t=5: earlier, for third car: at t=5, span [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.

So safe at t=5.\n\nt=5 is safe for y=6?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=6,7,8, but at t=5?\n\nAt t=5: third car span [-35+4*5, -24+4*5] = [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car: [37+4*5,48+20] = [37+20=57,48+20=68]? span [37+4t,48+4t] at t=5: [37+20,48+20]=[57,68], no.\n\nSecond: [1+20,12+20]=[21,32], no.\n\nSo at t=5, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: freeway 6 at t=4.\n\nThird car: [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], no.\n\nFirst: [37+16,48+16]=[53,64], no\n\nSecond: [1+16,12+16]=[17,28], no\n\nSafe.\n\nt=3: similarly safe.\n\nt=2,1,0 all safe except t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6: unsafe, as we saw.\n\nBut at t=5, safe.\n\nWe can be on y=6 at t=5.\n\nThen why not go to y=6 earlier?\n\nIn the path, we can reach y=6 at t=5 or t=6, but t=6 unsafe, so t=5 is good.\n\nHow to reach y=6 by t=5?\n\ny=6 at t=5 means position at turn t=5 is y=5? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTo have y_t =6 at some t.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y_5=6.\n\nThen we need to have moved accordingly.\n\nStart t=0 y=0\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=5, need 6 steps up, but with actions.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=5, 5 actions: a0 to a4, determining y1 to y5.\n\ny5 depends on a0 to a4.\n\ny1 = y0 + Δa0\n\ny2 = y1 + Δa1\n\n...\n\ny5 = y4 + Δa4\n\nBut y0=0.\n\nTo have y5=6, we need the sum of Δy from t=0 to t=4 to be +6.\n\nEach Δy is +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nSo we need exactly 6 Ups in 5 actions? Impossible, since only 5 actions, can have at most +5.\n\ny5 is after 5 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=0, position y0=0\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δa0\n\nAt turn t=1, position y1\n\nAfter a1, y2 = y1 + Δa1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δa_k\n\nFor position at turn T, it is y_T.\n\nTo have y_T = Y, we need after T actions, but actions from t=0 to t=T-1 determine y_T.\n\ny_T is determined by actions a_0 to a_{T-1}.\n\nSpecifically, y_T = y0 + sum_{t=0}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\nSince y0=0, y_T = sum of Δy from t=0 to t=T-1.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so to have y_T =6, we need at least 6 Ups, and the number of actions must be at least 6.\n\nFor example, minimal to y=6 is 6 actions: all U, reaching at t=6.\n\nWith 5 actions, y5 <=5, since max +5.\n\nSimilarly, y_T = sum of first T deltas.\n\nSo to be at y=6 at turn T, we need T >=6, and the sum of first T deltas to be 6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=9, T>=9.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe can be at y=6 at t=5? y5 at t=5.\n\nTo have y5=6, need sum of a0 to a4: 5 actions, max sum +5, so y5 <=5, cannot be 6.\n\ny5 is at turn t=5, after 5 actions from t=0 to t=4.\n\ny1 after a0, y2 after a1, ..., y5 after a4.\n\nSo y5 = 0 + Δa0 + Δa1 + Δa2 + Δa3 + Δa4\n\nEach Δ <=1, so y5 <=5.\n\nThus cannot be at y=6 before t=6.\n\nEarliest at t=6 with all U.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 and t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at t=6,7,8.\n\nFirst possible is t=9.\n\nWith y=6 at t=9.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=9, we need to have y9=6.\n\nWhich requires at least 6 Ups in first 9 actions.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=5 earlier.\n\nIn our path, we have to wait at y=5 until t=8 to go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nBut we could reach y=5 earlier.\n\nMinimal to y=5 is 5 turns: with 5 Ups, reach at t=5 y=5.\n\nBut can we?\n\nAs before: if we try a0:U t=1 y=1\n\na1:U t=2 y=2\n\na2:U t=3 y=3\n\nBut a3:U would go to y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we delay earlier.\n\nFor example, start at t=0 y=0\n\na0:U → t=1 y=1\n\nNow at t=1, instead of U, we stay: a1:S → t=2 y=1\n\nThen a2:U → t=3 y=2\n\na3:U → t=4 y=3\n\na4:U → t=5 y=4\n\nNow at t=5 y=4, safe.\n\nThen a5:U → t=6 y=5\n\nReached y=5 at t=6, same as before.\n\nIf we go down or something, worse.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=5 before t=6? In this, t=6 y=5.\n\nBut with the stay at t=1, we have y=1 at t=2, then y=2 at t=3, y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6.\n\nSame as first path without the early stay.\n\nFirst path: y=1 t=1, y=2 t=2, y=3 t=3, then stay t=4 y=3, then y=4 t=5, y=5 t=6.\n\nSame time.\n\nSo y=5 at t=6 is earliest possible, given the constraint at y=4.\n\nNow, from y=5 at t=6, we need to go to y=6, but not until t=9.\n\nSo we must stay at y=5 for turns t=6,7,8.\n\nThen at t=8, action U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen from y=6, go up to y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are safe after t=0, so no issue.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=0: action a0 = U  (to y=1 at t=1)\n\nTurn t=1: action a1 = U  (to y=2 at t=2)\n\nTurn t=2: action a2 = U  (to y=3 at t=3)\n\nTurn t=3: action a3 = S  (stay, y=3 at t=4)\n\nTurn t=4: action a4 = U  (to y=4 at t=5)\n\nTurn t=5: action a5 = U  (to y=5 at t=6)\n\nNow at t=6, y=5\n\nTurn t=6: action a6 = S  (stay, y=5 at t=7)\n\nTurn t=7: action a7 = S  (stay, y=5 at t=8)\n\nTurn t=8: action a8 = U  (to y=6 at t=9)\n\nTurn t=9: action a9 = U  (to y=7 at t=10)\n\nTurn t=10: action a10 = U  (to y=8 at t=11)\n\nTurn t=11: action a11 = U  (to y=9 at t=12)\n\nAt t=12, y=9, reached.\n\nH=12 turns? From t=0 to t=11 actions, position at t=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but with constraints, 12 is best?\n\nWe could go to y=7 or y=8 earlier, but since y=6 blocks, we have to wait.\n\nAnother idea: go down to avoid, but going down would take more time, probably worse.\n\nFor example, from y=5, if we go down to y=4, but y=4 might be unsafe at other times, but at t=6, y=4: freeway 4 at t=6.\n\nCars: first car span [-59+12*6, -48+12*6] = [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], no 0\n\nSecond car not, third [13+72? wait no, third car at y=4: (24,13,right,12) span [13+12t,24+12t] at t=6 [13+72,24+72]=[85,96], no\n\nSo safe, but if we go to y=4, we are lower, then need to come back up, which takes more actions, so not better.\n\nSimilarly, staying at y=5 is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly from y=5 to y=6 at a safe time, but no direct, must go through.\n\nAnother thought: at t=5, we are at y=4 or y=5.\n\nIn our path, at t=5, y=4.\n\nBut if we can be at y=5 at t=5, but earlier we saw not possible, since to reach y=5 at t=5 need 5 Ups in 5 actions, but with the y=4 constraint, we cannot have the fourth up at t=3 without being at y=4 at t=4 unsafe.\n\nUnless we do something else.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we are at y=2 (after a0:U, a1:U)\n\nThen instead of going up, we go down: a2:D → t=3 y=1\n\nThen at t=3 y=1, safe.\n\nThen a3:U → t=4 y=2\n\na4:U → t=5 y=3\n\na5:U → t=6 y=4\n\nBut at t=6 y=4, safe? y=4 at t=6: as above, safe.\n\nThen a6:U → t=7 y=5\n\nNow at t=7 y=5, later than before.\n\nThen we need to go to y=6 at t=9, so stay at y=5 for t=7 and t=8? At t=7 y=5, a7:S → t=8 y=5, a8:U → t=9 y=6, etc., but reached y=5 later, so worse.\n\nThus not better.\n\nSo the first path seems best.\n\nNow, about y=7 and y=8, in the sequence, we go through them, but they are safe, so no issue.\n\nIn the actions, we have to specify for each turn.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be actions from turn t1=0 onwards.\n\nAlso, H=12, with actions up to t=11.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point collision.\n\nFor example, at t=4, we are at y=3, freeway 3 at t=4: span [48-24*4,71-24*4]=[48-96,71-96]=[-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=5, y=4, freeway 4 at t=5: as before, safe.\n\nt=6, y=5, safe.\n\nt=7, y=5, safe.\n\nt=8, y=5, safe.\n\nt=9, y=6, freeway 6 at t=9: third car span [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10, y=7, freeway 7 at t=10: cars, first [37+120,48+120]=[157,168] no, second [-11+120,120]=[109,120] no, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=11, y=8, similar, safe.\n\nt=12, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we can be at y=6 at t=9 with fewer actions, but since we need to be at high y, and delays, probably not.\n\nFor example, if we could skip waiting, but we have to wait for y=6 to be safe.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe from t=6 to t=8, and we must be on it only from t=9, we need to arrive at t=9.\n\nTo arrive at y=6 at t=9, we must start from y=5 at t=8 with U.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be at y=5 at t=8, which we can be earlier, but since we reached y=5 at t=6, we stay.\n\nIf we can reach y=5 later, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose we spend less time at lower levels, but we are constrained by y=4 at t=4.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 or something, but that takes more actions.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nH=12 turns: from start to end, 12 actions? From t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, and position at t=12 is y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t=12.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: I think H is the number of actions or the turns?\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nHere t1=0, so y_{0 + H -1} = y_{H-1} =9\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to t=H-2? The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1? Indexing.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nSince t1=0, actions at time 0 to H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, position at time t1 + H, but the position is at turn after actions.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter actions a_0 to a_{k-1}, we have y_k.\n\nTo have y_{H-1} =9, with actions a_0 to a_{H-2}.\n\nFor example, with H actions from a0 to a_{H-1}, we have positions up to y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn 0, y0=0\n\nAfter a0, y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1}\n\nSo at turn T, y_T.\n\ny_T =9 at some T.\n\nH is the number of turns? \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo for t1=0, reach at turn H-1.\n\nAnd actions from turn t1=0 to turn H-1? The sequence is actions for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for turn 0 to turn H-1, actions a_0 to a_{H-1}.\n\nThen position at turn H is y_H, but we need position at turn H-1 to be 9.\n\ny_{H-1} is position at turn H-1.\n\nAfter actions up to a_{H-2}, we have y_{H-1}.\n\nAction a_{H-1} is taken at turn H-1, which sets y_H.\n\nBut we don't care about y_H, as long as y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn H-1, we might have an action, but if y_{H-1}=9, we can have S or something, but since we reached, it doesn't matter, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn this case, to reach at turn H-1, with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn our path, we have y_{12}=9, so H-1=12, so H=13? Let's see.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nAt turn t=0, y0=0\n\nAfter a0:U, y1=1 at t=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a11:U, y12=9 at t=12\n\nSo y12=9 at turn 12.\n\nThus we reached at turn 12.\n\nNow, H-1=12, so H=13.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=12? No.\n\nThe sequence: actions {a_t for t=0 to H-1} such that after these actions, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=0, so y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nWe have y_{12}=9, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=H-1 = t=0 to 12.\n\nBut at turn 12, if we take action a12, it would set y13, but since we already reached at y12=9, we don't need to take action at turn 12, I think.\n\nThe sequence should be until we reach.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turns when we are not yet at goal.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H, but position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9? Confusion.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd the actions are performed at turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter performing action at turn t, we get position at turn t+1.\n\nBut the position at turn T is y_T, before any action at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is based on y_T at turn T.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor t1=0, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe actions are for turns from t1 to t1 + H -1, i.e., from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn H-1, we have y_H, but we need y_{H-1}=9, which is before action at turn H-1.\n\ny_{H-1} is the position at the start of turn H-1.\n\nThen at turn H-1, we perform action a_{H-1}, which sets y_H.\n\nBut for y_{H-1} to be 9, we don't necessarily need to perform an action at turn H-1; it could be that we reached at turn H-1, and we can choose to stay or something, but the action sequence includes a_{H-1}.\n\nIn the case where y_{H-1}=9, we can have a_{H-1} = S, for example.\n\nIn our path, at turn 12, y12=9, so if we set H-1=12, H=13, then actions from t=0 to t=12.\n\nAt turn 12, since y12=9, we can set a12=S or whatever, but it doesn't affect, since we are already at goal.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should stop when we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=13, actions a0 to a12, with y_{12}=9.\n\nBut y_{12} is set before action a12, so we need to have reached by turn 12 with the previous actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a0 to a11 determine y12.\n\nAction a12 is at turn 12, which sets y13, but since we don't care about y13, we can set a12=S or U, but y13 might be 10 or something, but since y=9 is safe, we can stay.\n\nBut for the purpose, we can include it.\n\nTo have minimal H, we can have the action sequence such that y_{H-1}=9 with the first H-1 actions.\n\nIn our case, with actions a0 to a11, we have y12=9, so if we set H-1=12, H=13, then actions a0 to a12, but a12 is extra.\n\ny_{H-1} = y_{12} =9, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a0 to a12.\n\nBut a0 to a11 are the moves to reach, a12 can be S, for example.\n\nWe can have a shorter sequence if we reach earlier, but we didn't.\n\nSince we reach at turn 12, and y12=9, so the turn when we reach is 12, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to reach is 12, meaning after 12 turns we are at y=9.\n\nTurn 12 is when we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions to reach: from turn 0 to turn 11, 12 actions, we reach at turn 12.\n\nIn terms of H, \"minimal number of turns H\", and reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 0 + H -1 = turn when we reach.\n\nSet T_reach = H-1.\n\nThen H = T_reach +1.\n\nBut H is called \"number of turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n\nIn the context, I think H is the length of the action sequence.\n\nFor example, to reach in one turn: if start at y=9, but here not.\n\nMinimal H: with all U, we reach at turn 9, y9=9, with 9 actions a0 to a8, each U.\n\nThen H=9, y_{0+9-1}=y8=9? Let's see.\n\nWith actions a0 to a8 (9 actions), y1 to y9 are set.\n\ny1 after a0, ..., y9 after a8.\n\nAt turn 9, y9=9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{0 + 9 -1} = y8.\n\nBut with a0 to a8, y9=9, not y8.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nIf we want y_{H-1}=9, with actions up to a_{H-2}.\n\nFor example, to have y8=9, we need to reach at turn 8.\n\nWith actions a0 to a7, y8 can be set.\n\nIf all U, y8=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 8, need to have moved faster, but not possible.\n\nIn general, to reach y=K at turn T, need at least K ups, so T >= K.\n\nFor y=9 at turn T, T>=9.\n\nIn our case, with constraints, we reached at turn 12.\n\nIn the action sequence for H, we need y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn our path, we have y12=9, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=12 (13 actions), but at turn 12, we are already at y=9, so a12 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nTo avoid extra action, we can have the sequence such that after a_{H-2}, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn that case, for our path, we have after a11, y12=9, so if we set H-1=12, H=13, then actions a0 to a12, with a12 being redundant but necessary for the sequence.\n\nSince y12=9, at turn 12, we can choose a12=S.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nNow back to the sequence.\n\nIn our sequence, we have 12 actions to reach: a0 to a11.\n\nBut for the sequence, we need to list actions from turn t1=0.\n\nNow, in the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAfter a11:U, y12 = y11 +1, but y11 is what?\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAfter a0:U, y1=1\n\na1:U, y2=2\n\na2:U, y3=3\n\na3:S, y4=3 (since ΔS=0)\n\na4:U, y5=4\n\na5:U, y6=5\n\na6:S, y7=5\n\na7:S, y8=5\n\na8:U, y9=6\n\na9:U, y10=7\n\na10:U, y11=8\n\na11:U, y12=9\n\nYes, y12=9.\n\nTo have y_{H-1}=9, set H-1=12, so H=13.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=12.\n\nAt turn 12, y12=9, so we need to specify a12.\n\nWe can set a12=S, for example.\n\nSince we reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence, we can include it.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 11, action U to go from y11=8 to y12=9.\n\nIn the list above, turn 11: a11=U\n\nThen at turn 12, we are at y12=9.\n\nNow for H=13, we add turn 12: a12=S or something.\n\nBut in the minimal, since we reached at turn 12, H should be 13 with the action at turn 12.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=12 where we reach at turn 11.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 11, we need to be faster, but with constraints, not possible.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=9 at turn 11, but we have to go through y=6 which is blocked until t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we are at y=6, then to y=9, need 3 more turns: t=10 y=7, t=11 y=8, t=12 y=9.\n\nCannot reach before t=12.\n\nThus minimal H=13, with y_{12}=9.\n\nNow, the action sequence: actions for turn 0 to 12.\n\nBut at turn 12, since y12=9, we set a12=S.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S  (since already at y=9)\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 13. This sequence ensures that the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 (since \\(y_{H-1} = y_{12} = 9\\)) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The actions are chosen to navigate around unsafe times on the freeways:\n\n- Freeway 2 is unsafe at turn 1.\n- Freeway 3 is unsafe at turn 2.\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns 1 and 4.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n- Freeways 1, 5, 7, and 8 are safe except for irrelevant times (e.g., freeways 1, 7, and 8 are unsafe only at turn 0, but the player is not on them then).\n\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) by moving up directly when possible and staying at safe positions (e.g., staying at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4, and staying at \\(y = 5\\) to avoid \\(y = 6\\) during turns 6–8). The action at turn 12 is \"S\" (stay) since the player has already reached \\(y = 9\\) at the start of turn 12.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 0: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1)\n- Turn 1: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2)\n- Turn 2: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 3)\n- Turn 3: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 4 to avoid unsafe \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4)\n- Turn 4: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: S (stay at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 7 to avoid unsafe \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: S (stay at \\(y = 5\\) for turn 8 to avoid unsafe \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9, now safe)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached)\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 with \\(H = 13\\) turns (actions from turn 0 to turn 12).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- For a left-moving car (direction left): at time T, the car span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But note the example: \n  Actually, the rule says:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  However, note that for a left-moving car, the head is at a larger x and then moves left (so decreasing x). So if at t1 the head is h and tail is τ, and h > τ (because the car is from τ to h, with h being the front when moving left? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But note that in the example for freeway 3: (0,23,left,24) -> at t1=2, the span is [0,23]? That would be from 0 to 23? But then if we move left, at a later time T, the span becomes [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)].\n\nBut wait: the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning h is the head and τ the tail? And then it moves left so both decrease. Similarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the tail is at τ and head at h? And then moves right so both increase.\n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> this is a right-moving car. So at t1=2, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So the car is from -59 to -48? Then at time T, the span becomes [-59 + 12*(T-2), -48 + 12*(T-2)].\n  Car2: (24,13,right,12) -> wait, 24>13? So if we take [τ, h] = [13,24]? Then the car is from 13 to 24? Then at time T: [13+12*(T-2), 24+12*(T-2)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the tail is τ and head is h? Then the car occupies [τ, h]. But in the first car: τ=-59, h=-48 -> so the car is from -59 to -48. The second car: τ=13, h=24 -> from 13 to 24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (0,23,left,24) -> left-moving: Span(t1)= [h,τ] = [0,23]? Then the car is from 0 to 23? But wait, 0<23, so that would be a car from 0 to 23? Then when moving left, the entire car moves left. So at time T: [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)].\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and if at that same turn, on freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of the car.\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y (not y+1). So at the moment of the move (turn T), the player is on the freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player will be on freeway y+1 (if moved up) and then we check the car on freeway y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that minimizes H (number of turns) to get to y=9.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 2.\n\nWe can model the state as (turn, y) and we wish to reach (any turn, y=9). However, the turn matters because the cars move with time.\n\nWe need to avoid being at (0, y) at a turn T if on freeway y at that turn T, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nWe are allowed to stay at the same y (by S or by moving vertically and then coming back? but we want minimal turns so we probably want to go up as much as possible).\n\nSince we start at y=2 and need to get to y=9, we must move up at least 7 times. We can also move down, but that would increase the number of turns. So we want to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe must plan for each freeway we cross: we start at y=2, then we will be at y=2, then we move to y=3, then to y=4, ... until y=9.\n\nBut note: we can also stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But that would increase H. So we want to avoid staying if possible.\n\nHowever, sometimes we might have to wait because a car is blocking.\n\nSo we need to simulate the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe are at turn 2. We are going to simulate from turn 2 onwards.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 2. Then we choose an action for turn 2, which will determine y at turn 3.\n\nWe are free to choose U, D, or S at each turn.\n\nWe note that the grid is only from y=0 to 9. We start at y=2 and we are going to 9. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn: at turn T, we are at (0, y_T) and we must not have a car on freeway y_T at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\nLet's list the freeways we have to cross: we start at y=2. Then we need to get to y=3, then y=4, ... y=9. So we have to be at freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and then 9.\n\nBut note: at the turn when we are at freeway y, we are at that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway and for each future turn (starting from turn 2) whether there is a car at that freeway at that turn that covers x=0.\n\nWe can precompute the blocking times for each freeway.\n\nWe'll create a function: is_blocked(y, t) that returns True if at turn t, freeway y has a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: the cars are given at turn t1=2. So for a car on freeway y:\n\nFor each car on freeway y:\n  Let the car be represented by (head, tail, direction, speed) as given at turn 2.\n\nBut note: the problem gives the car state at turn t1=2. So we can compute the car's position at any turn T (>=2) by:\n\n  If direction is 'right':\n      τ_initial = tail, h_initial = head? But the problem says for right-moving: at turn 2, the span is [τ, h]. Then at turn T, the span is [τ + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)].\n\n  If direction is 'left':\n      at turn 2, the span is [h, τ] -> meaning from h to τ? But note: in the example freeway 3: (0,23,left,24) -> so h=0, τ=23. Then at turn T: [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)].\n\nBut note: the order in the span: for a left-moving car, the head is at the larger x? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if at t1, h and τ are such that h > τ? But in freeway 3: h=0, τ=23 -> then 0 < 23, so the span [0,23] is from 0 to 23? Then when moving left, the car moves to the left, so the entire segment shifts left.\n\nBut note: the representation [h, τ] for left-moving might be confusing because typically we write intervals with the lower bound first. However, the problem does not specify the order. But the collision condition is: 0 is in the span. So we can compute the interval as:\n\n  For left-moving: [min, max] = [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)]? But wait, if h and τ are given and we subtract the same amount, then the interval remains the same relative positions. However, if at t1=2, the car is from h to τ (with h and τ in any order?) the problem does not say. But note the example: freeway 3: (0,23,left,24). If we take the interval as [0,23] at T=2, then at T=3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24, -1]. Then at T=2, 0 is in [0,23]? Yes, so at T=2, freeway 3 is blocked at x=0? But wait, at turn 2 we are at freeway 2 (y=2), so freeway 3 is not checked at turn 2.\n\nBut for freeway 2: \n  Car: (48,1,right,48) -> wait, 48 and 1? For right-moving: [τ, h] = [1,48]? Then the car is from 1 to 48 at turn 2? Then at turn 2, the car covers [1,48] -> so 0 is not in [1,48] -> not blocked at turn 2.\n\nBut note: the representation: for right-moving, the span is [τ, h]. So if τ=48 and h=1? That would be [48,1] which is backwards? The problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So if the car is moving right, then τ should be the tail (leftmost) and h the head (rightmost). So we must have τ <= h. But in the given data for freeway 2: (48,1,right,48) -> if we interpret as (head, tail) then head=48, tail=1? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the tail τ and head h? Then the car should be from τ to h. But 48>1, so if we take τ=1 and h=48? That would make sense: the car is from 1 to 48. But the data is given as (head, tail) or (tail, head)? The table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nThis is ambiguous. Looking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: first car: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> if we take as (h, τ) then h=-48, τ=-59. For a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [τ, h]? Then [ -59, -48 ]? That makes sense: the car is from -59 to -48. Similarly, the second car: (24,13,right,12) -> if we take h=24, τ=13, then the span is [13,24]. \n\nFreeway 2: (48,1,right,48) -> h=48, τ=1 -> span [1,48]. Then at turn 2, the car is from 1 to 48 -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 3: (0,23,left,24) -> for left-moving, the span is [h,τ] = [0,23] -> so the car is from 0 to 23 -> at turn 2, 0 is in [0,23] -> so freeway 3 is blocked at turn 2? But we are at freeway 2 at turn 2, so we don't care about freeway 3 at turn 2.\n\nSo we interpret the car data as: for a car (h, τ, d, s):\n  if d is right: the car at turn t1 is from τ to h (so the car occupies [τ, h] and we require τ<=h? Actually, the example freeway1: (-48,-59,right,12): if we take τ=-59 and h=-48, then τ<=h. Similarly, freeway2: (48,1,right,48): if we take τ=1, h=48 -> then [1,48] and τ<=h. But the data is given as (h, τ) in that order? Then for freeway2: h=48, τ=1 -> so the tail is τ=1 and head is h=48? Then the span is [τ, h] = [1,48].\n\nFor left-moving: freeway3: (0,23,left,24): the span is [h,τ] = [0,23] -> so the car is from 0 to 23. But note: 0<=23, so it's [0,23]. Then at turn 2, 0 is in [0,23] -> so freeway3 is blocked at turn 2.\n\nSo to compute for a freeway y and a turn T (>=t1=2):\n\n  For each car on freeway y:\n      if direction is 'right':\n          τ_initial = tail (the second number in the tuple)\n          h_initial = head (the first number in the tuple)\n          Then at turn T: \n             τ_T = τ_initial + s*(T-2)\n             h_T = h_initial + s*(T-2)\n          The car covers [τ_T, h_T] (assuming τ_initial <= h_initial, which they are? because the car is contiguous and moving right: the tail is the left end and head the right end).\n\n      if direction is 'left':\n          h_initial = head (first number)\n          τ_initial = tail (second number)\n          Then at turn T:\n             h_T = h_initial - s*(T-2)\n             τ_T = τ_initial - s*(T-2)\n          The car covers [h_T, τ_T]? But note: the problem says for left-moving the span is [h, τ] at t1, and then [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)] at T. But if at t1, h_initial < τ_initial, then the interval is [h_initial, τ_initial]. Then at T, we have [h_initial - s*(T-2), τ_initial - s*(T-2)]. This interval is still [low, high] if we define low = min(h_initial, τ_initial) and high = max? But actually, the subtraction is linear so the order remains.\n\n  However, note: the interval might be given in reverse? But for collision, we just need to check if 0 is between the two endpoints (inclusive). So we can compute the interval as [min, max] at time T.\n\n  Actually, regardless of the order, we can define:\n      low = min( h_initial, τ_initial )   ??? But wait, for left-moving: at t1, the span is [h_initial, τ_initial] but if h_initial <= τ_initial, then the interval is [h_initial, τ_initial]. Then at T: [h_initial - s*(T-2), τ_initial - s*(T-2)]. Since h_initial<=τ_initial, then the new interval is [h_initial - s*(T-2), τ_initial - s*(T-2)] and the lower bound is h_initial - s*(T-2) and the upper bound τ_initial - s*(T-2). Similarly, for right-moving: [τ_initial, h_initial] at t1, then at T: [τ_initial+s*(T-2), h_initial+s*(T-2)] -> the lower bound is τ_initial+s*(T-2) and the upper bound h_initial+s*(T-2).\n\n  But note: in the data, for left-moving, we have freeway3: (0,23,left,24) -> h_initial=0, τ_initial=23. Then at T=2: [0,23]. At T=3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1]. Then the interval is from -24 to -1.\n\n  So we can compute for a car:\n      if direction is 'right':\n          low_T = τ_initial + s*(T-2)\n          high_T = h_initial + s*(T-2)\n      if direction is 'left':\n          low_T = h_initial - s*(T-2)\n          high_T = τ_initial - s*(T-2)\n\n  Then the car blocks x=0 at turn T on freeway y if and only if: low_T <= 0 <= high_T.\n\nBut wait: for left-moving, we did [h_initial - s*(T-2), τ_initial - s*(T-2)] -> but if h_initial < τ_initial, then this is increasing? Actually, no: because if we subtract the same amount, the relative order remains: if h_initial < τ_initial, then h_initial - s*(T-2) < τ_initial - s*(T-2). So the interval is [h_initial - s*(T-2), τ_initial - s*(T-2)].\n\nBut what if the car is given with h_initial > τ_initial? For example, if a left-moving car was given as (23,0,left,24)? Then at t1: [23,0]? Then at T: [23-24*(T-2), 0-24*(T-2)] -> which would be [23-24*(T-2), -24*(T-2)]. Then the interval is from min(23-24*(T-2), -24*(T-2)) to max? But the problem says the span is [h, τ] at t1 and then subtracts the same amount. So if at t1 the span is [23,0], then at T it is [23-24*(T-2), 0-24*(T-2)]. This is an interval that goes from a larger number to a smaller? Then 0 is in the interval if the interval covers 0? Actually, we can check: 0 is in [a, b] (if a<=b) or in [b, a] (if b<=a)? \n\nTo avoid confusion, we can always compute:\n   low_car = min( h_initial, τ_initial )   ??? But wait, the direction matters.\n\nActually, the problem states the span at t1 for left-moving as [h, τ]. We don't know if h and τ are in increasing order? But in the examples, for left-moving: freeway3: (0,23) -> 0<23. For right-moving: freeway1: (-48,-59) -> but then the car is [τ, h] = [-59,-48] -> which is increasing. So it appears that the representation for right-moving uses τ as the left end and h as the right end, and for left-moving the problem uses h as the left end and τ as the right end? But freeway3: (0,23,left,24): [0,23] -> so 0 is left and 23 is right? Then when moving left, the entire car moves left. \n\nAlternatively, we can think: for a left-moving car, the head is the front, which is the rightmost part? Then at t1, the head is at h and the tail is at τ, and since it's moving left, the head is at a larger x than the tail? But then the car would be from τ to h (with τ < h). Then the span [h, τ] doesn't make sense as an interval. \n\nAfter re‐reading the problem: \n  For left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" -> and then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut if the car is from τ to h (with τ < h) and moving left, then the entire segment shifts left. Then at t1, the car occupies [τ, h]. Then at T, it occupies [τ - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]. But the problem writes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? That would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] which is [larger number, smaller number]? So if we interpret the span as [min, max] we have to take the min and max.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can compute the car's position at T as:\n\n  For a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at freeway y at turn t1=2:\n\n      if direction == 'right':\n          left_end = tail + speed*(T-2)\n          right_end = head + speed*(T-2)\n\n      if direction == 'left':\n          # The head is the rightmost? But the problem says the span at t1 is [head, tail] and then subtracts? \n          # But note: in the example freeway3: head=0, tail=23 -> then at T, [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)] -> so the left end becomes 0-24*(T-2) and the right end becomes 23-24*(T-2). But 0-24*(T-2) is less than 23-24*(T-2) because 0<23? \n          # Actually, regardless, we can set:\n          left_end = head - speed*(T-2)\n          right_end = tail - speed*(T-2)\n\n          But wait: the problem says for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if we take head = h and tail = τ, then the new head is h - s*(T-2) and the new tail is τ - s*(T-2). Then the car occupies from min(head_new, tail_new) to max(head_new, tail_new)? \n\n          However, in the example: head=0, tail=23 -> then head_new = 0-24*(T-2), tail_new=23-24*(T-2). Since 0<23, then head_new < tail_new. So the car is from head_new to tail_new? \n\n          But the problem says the span is [head_new, tail_new]? Then if head_new > tail_new, that would be a backward interval? \n\n      Alternatively, we can simply compute the two endpoints and then set:\n          left_end = min( head - speed*(T-2), tail - speed*(T-2) )\n          right_end = max( head - speed*(T-2), tail - speed*(T-2) )\n\n      Similarly, for right-moving: \n          left_end = min( tail + speed*(T-2), head + speed*(T-2) )\n          right_end = max( tail + speed*(T-2), head + speed*(T-2) )\n\nBut wait, for right-moving: the problem says the span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] -> which is [tail + s*(T-2), head + s*(T-2)]. Then if tail <= head, then the interval is [tail + s*(T-2), head + s*(T-2)] and the min is tail+s*(T-2) and the max head+s*(T-2). But if tail>head? Then it would be [tail+s*(T-2), head+s*(T-2)] which is decreasing? Then we should take the min and max.\n\nHowever, in the given data, for right-moving: freeway1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> tail=-59, head=-48 -> then at T: [-59+12*(T-2), -48+12*(T-2)] -> which is increasing. Similarly, freeway2: (48,1,right,48) -> tail=1, head=48 -> increasing. So the data is given such that for right-moving: tail <= head? and for left-moving: head <= tail? \n\nLooking at freeway3: (0,23,left,24) -> head=0, tail=23 -> then head<=tail? \n\nSo it seems the data is consistent: for a car, the head and tail are given such that for right-moving: tail <= head, and for left-moving: head <= tail? \n\nBut note: the problem doesn't specify that. However, we can use the min and max to be safe.\n\nSo we'll do:\n\n  For a car (h, τ, d, s) on freeway y:\n\n      if d == 'right':\n          x1 = τ + s*(T-2)\n          x2 = h + s*(T-2)\n          low_car = min(x1, x2)\n          high_car = max(x1, x2)\n\n      if d == 'left':\n          x1 = h - s*(T-2)\n          x2 = τ - s*(T-2)\n          low_car = min(x1, x2)\n          high_car = max(x1, x2)\n\n  Then the car blocks x=0 at turn T if: low_car <= 0 <= high_car.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car spans [h, τ] for left and [τ, h] for right? But we are using the entire segment between the two endpoints. So by taking the min and max we are covering the entire car.\n\nNow, for each freeway y (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 2), we can compute if there is at least one car on freeway y at turn T that blocks x=0.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 2 until we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe are going to use BFS in the state (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 2) and y is the current vertical position (0..9). We wish to minimize the number of turns (so BFS by depth = turns passed).\n\nBut note: the state space in time is infinite? But we can bound the time: since we want minimal turns, we won't stay arbitrarily long. We can set a limit: worst-case we might have to wait for a car to pass, and the cars move at speeds at least 4 (from the data) and the grid is periodic? But note: the cars move infinitely, and the spans move without bound. However, the blocking is periodic? \n\nBut note: the speeds are integers, and the initial positions are integers. The cars are of integer length. The blocking condition: 0 is in [low_car, high_car]. \n\nBut we can compute the blocking for a freeway y: the set of turns T at which freeway y is blocked at x=0.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway y (1..8) the set of turns T (>=2) for which it is blocked.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 2. We are going to simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll compute the blocking for freeways 1 to 8 for a range of turns, say from T=2 to T=50 (we can extend if needed).\n\nLet's create a 2D array: blocked[y][T] for y in [1,8] and T in [2, 50] (or more).\n\nBut note: we don't need to store for all T, we can compute on the fly.\n\nWe'll write a helper function:\n\n  def is_freeway_blocked(y, T):\n      # T is the turn (>=2)\n      cars = cars_on_freeway[y]   # list of cars on freeway y at turn 2\n      for car in cars:\n          (h, τ, d, s) = car\n          if d == 'right':\n              x1 = τ + s*(T-2)\n              x2 = h + s*(T-2)\n              low_car = min(x1, x2)\n              high_car = max(x1, x2)\n          elif d == 'left':\n              x1 = h - s*(T-2)\n              x2 = τ - s*(T-2)\n              low_car = min(x1, x2)\n              high_car = max(x1, x2)\n          if low_car <= 0 <= high_car:\n              return True   # blocked\n      return False\n\nBut note: the data for freeway y:\n\nWe have:\n\nfreeways = {\n  1: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 12), (24, 13, 'right', 12) ],\n  2: [ (48, 1, 'right', 48) ],\n  3: [ (0, 23, 'left', 24) ],\n  4: [ (-24, -35, 'right', 12), (12, 1, 'right', 12), (48, 37, 'right', 12) ],\n  5: [ (56, 45, 'right', 4) ],   # note: (56,45) -> for right: [45,56] at T=2?

So we prefer U.\n\nBut we must check the next freeway when we move.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe can use BFS:\n\n  State: (turn, y)\n\n  Actions: U, D, S\n\n  Constraints:\n      - y must be in [0,9]\n      - at the state (turn, y), we must be safe: if y is in [1,8] (because only freeways 1..8 have cars) then we check that freeway y is not blocked at turn T=turn.\n        But note: if y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? The problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1..8. So at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\n  Goal: y=9.\n\nWe start at (2,2). We want the minimal number of turns (i.e., minimal additional turns beyond the start) to reach (turn,9). The total turns H is the number of actions taken. Since we start at turn2 and take an action at turn2, then at turn3 we take the next, etc. until we are at y=9 at the end of the last action.\n\nNote: we are at (0,2) at turn2. Then after H actions, we are at turn2+H. We require that at turn2+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we take action at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nSo we start at (turn2, y=2). We take an action at turn2, then at turn3 we have updated y, and so on until we are at y=9 at turn (2+H-1) = 1+H.\n\nWe are going to do BFS:\n\n  We'll let depth d = 0,1,2,... (number of actions taken so far). Then the current turn = 2 + d.\n\n  State: (d, y) -> but we need to know the current turn = 2+d, and the position y.\n\n  We wish to reach y=9 at any depth d (with d>=0).\n\n  We start at d=0: (y=2)\n\n  Then we consider d=1: take an action at turn2 -> then at turn3 (d=1) we are at y2 = 2+? \n\n  Actually, we can represent the state as (turn, y). We start at (2,2). Then from (t,y) we can go to (t+1, y') where y' = y, or y+1, or y-1 (if within bounds).\n\n  We'll use a queue: (turn, y, path) where path is the list of actions so far.\n\n  We wish to minimize the number of actions (so BFS by depth).\n\nBut the turn increases, and we have to compute blocking for that turn.\n\nWe'll start:\n\n  Let's initialize:\n\n      queue: [(2, 2, [])]   # at turn 2, y=2, no actions taken so far.\n\n      visited: set of (turn, y) that we have seen? But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary (if we wait). So we don't want to mark a state (turn,y) as visited? Actually, we can use (turn, y) as state and we don't need to revisit the same (turn,y) because the future from that state is the same. So we mark (turn,y) as visited.\n\nBut note: the blocking depends only on the turn and the freeway. So if we are at (turn,y) and we have been there before, then we skip.\n\nWe run until we find y=9.\n\nWe'll simulate until we find the goal.\n\nWe'll check at each step:\n\n  At the current state (turn, y): if y is between 1 and 8, then check if freeway y is blocked at turn. If blocked, then we cannot be here -> skip this state? Actually, we start at (2,2) and we check: freeway2 at turn2: safe -> so we proceed.\n\nThen we expand to next states: by U, D, S.\n\nBut note: when we move, we are at the next freeway at the next turn? \n\nExample: at (2,2), we take action U: then at turn3, we are at y=3.\n\nBut at turn3, we must check freeway3? because we are at freeway3 at turn3.\n\nSimilarly, if we take S: then at turn3, we are at y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn3.\n\nWe must avoid being in a blocked state.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  while queue not empty:\n      pop state (t, y, path)\n      if y == 9: we output path and break.\n\n      Otherwise, for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n          new_y = y + (1 if 'U' else -1 if 'D' else 0)\n          if new_y <0 or new_y>9: skip.\n\n          new_t = t+1\n\n          Now, at state (new_t, new_y): we must check if this state is safe?\n            But note: the state (new_t, new_y) is the state after the action, meaning at turn new_t we are at freeway new_y.\n\n          However, we must check the freeway at the turn when we are there: so at turn new_t, if new_y is in [1,8], then check if freeway new_y is blocked at turn new_t.\n\n          If it is blocked, then we skip.\n\n          If it is safe, then we check if (new_t, new_y) has been visited? If not, we add (new_t, new_y, path + [action]) to the queue.\n\nBut note: we start at (2,2) and we are about to take an action at turn2, which leads to state at turn3.\n\nWe are not checking the starting state? But we already know that (2,2) is safe (as we checked at the beginning).\n\nBut in the BFS, we start by checking (2,2) and then we generate the next states.\n\nWe must also check that we don't go beyond a certain turn? We can set a limit, say 100 turns.\n\nLet's run:\n\nStart: \n  state: (turn=2, y=2, path=[])\n    Goal? y=2 !=9 -> continue.\n\n  Actions: \n      U: new_y=3, new_t=3 -> check freeway3 at turn3: \n          freeway3: (0,23,left,24) -> at turn3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1] -> not blocked -> safe.\n          state (3,3) -> new state.\n\n      D: new_y=1, new_t=3 -> check freeway1 at turn3: \n          freeway1: \n             car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at turn3: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> not blocked.\n             car2: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> not blocked.\n          so safe -> state (3,1)\n\n      S: new_y=2, new_t=3 -> check freeway2 at turn3: \n          freeway2: [1+48, 48+48]? -> wait, the car: (48,1,right,48) -> \n          at turn3: [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96] -> not blocked -> safe -> state (3,2)\n\nSo we have three states: (3,3), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nNow, we expand these.\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible. We'll do BFS so we go by depth.\n\nDepth1: we have three states.\n\nWe'll take the state (3,3) first? But BFS uses a queue.\n\nWe'll use a queue (FIFO).

But we are focusing on the branch that is progressing.\n\nAt (7,5): \n  turn=7, y=5 -> safe? freeway5: [45+4*5=65,56+20=76] -> safe.\n  Actions:\n      U: y=6, turn=8 -> freeway6: \n          at turn8: \n            car3: (-16,-27,right,4): [-27+4*(8-2)= -27+24=-3, -16+24=8] -> [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> blocked -> skip.\n      D: y=4, turn=8 -> freeway4: \n          at turn8: \n            car1: [-35+12*6, -24+72] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            car2: [1+12*6,12+72]=[73,84] -> safe.\n            car3: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n          state (8,4)\n      S: y=5, turn=8 -> freeway5: [45+4*6=45+24=69,56+24=80] -> safe -> state (8,5)\n\nBut we also have state (7,4): \n  turn=7, y=4 -> safe? freeway4: safe as above.\n  Actions:\n      U: y=5, turn=8 -> freeway5: [45+24=69,56+24=80] -> safe -> state (8,5) [duplicate]\n      D: y=3, turn=8 -> freeway3: [0-24*6,23-24*6]=[-144,-121] -> safe -> state (8,3)\n      S: state (8,4)\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We are at y=5 at turn7. We need 4 more moves? \n\nBut we are blocked at freeway6 at turn8? \n\nWe have to wait? \n\nAt (7,5) we can't go up to 6 at turn8 because freeway6 is blocked at turn8.\n\nWe can go down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nOr we can stay at y=5 for one turn (turn7->turn8: state (8,5)) and then at turn8 we are at y=5. Then at turn9 we can try to go up to y=6? \n\nBut at turn9, freeway6: \n  car3: [-27+4*(9-2)= -27+28=1, -16+28=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? \n  Also check other cars on freeway6:\n      car1: (56,45,right,4) -> [45+4*7,56+28]=[73,84] -> safe.\n      car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9+28,20+28]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn9, freeway6 is safe.\n\nSo from (7,5): \n  Option: at turn7: S -> to (8,5) [safe at turn8? freeway5: [45+4*(8-2)=45+24=69,56+24=80] -> safe]\n  Then at turn8: U -> to (9,6): check freeway6 at turn9: as above, safe? \n        turn9: freeway6: \n            car3: [-27+4*(9-2)= -27+28=1, -16+28=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at freeway6 at turn9. The car3 at turn9: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo that works.\n\nThen at (9,6): we can go up to (10,7): \n  freeway7 at turn10: \n      freeway7: same as freeway1: \n          car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at turn10: [-59+12*(10-2)= -59+96=37, -48+96=48] -> safe.\n          car2: (24,13,right,12): [13+96,24+96]=[109,120] -> safe.\n      so safe.\n\nThen (10,7) -> to (11,8): freeway8 at turn11: \n      freeway8: same as freeway7: \n          car1: [-59+12*(11-2)= -59+108=49, -48+108=60] -> safe.\n          car2: [13+108,24+108]=[121,132] -> safe.\n      safe.\n\nThen (11,8) -> to (12,9): goal.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn12 -> so H = 12 - 2 = 10? \n\nBut the sequence: \n  We take actions at turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 10 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn2 and after 10 actions we are at turn12.\n\nBut we want to minimize H. Is there a shorter path?\n\nWe were at y=5 at turn7. We then did: \n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=5\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=6\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=7\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=8\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=9\n\nThat's 5 moves from (7,5) to (12,9): 5 actions.\n\nBut we might have a faster way?\n\nAlternatively, at turn7 we are at (7,5). We cannot go up to 6 at turn8 because freeway6 is blocked at turn8. But what about going down and then up? That would take more moves.\n\nSo the above seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can get to y=9 earlier.\n\nWe started at turn2 at y=2. The minimal number of moves (if no blocking) is 7 moves: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9.\n\nBut we saw that at freeway4 at turn4 it was blocked, so we had to wait? Actually, we went through freeway4 at turn5: which was safe.\n\nThen at freeway6: we encountered blocking at turns 6,7,8. So we had to avoid being at freeway6 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe were at y=5 at turn7. Then we had to wait at turn7 (stay at y=5) so that at turn8 we are still at y=5, then at turn9 we can go to y=6.\n\nSo the moves:\n\n  turn2: ... we need to see the path that got to (7,5) in 5 moves? \n\nWe have a state (5,4) at turn5 (depth3: 3 actions taken) and then from (5,4) we went U at turn5 to (6,5) at turn6.\n\nThen at (6,5) we couldn't go up at turn6 to (7,6) because freeway6 was blocked at turn7? Actually, we tried to go U at turn6 to turn7 at y=6: and freeway6 at turn7 is blocked (because turn7: freeway6 car3: [-7,4] -> blocked). So we had to choose D or S. We chose D: to (7,4) or S: to (7,5). We did S to (7,5).\n\nSo the path to (7,5):\n\n  Start: (2,2)\n  We need to get to (5,4) in 3 moves? \n\nWe had several branches. The one that got to (5,4) was:\n\n  (2,2) -> U (to 3,3) at turn3\n  (3,3) -> S (to 4,3) at turn4? \n  Then (4,3) -> U (to 5,4) at turn5.\n\nBut wait, from (3,3) we had three options: U (blocked at freeway4 at turn4), D (to (4,2)), S (to (4,3)). So we took S to (4,3). Then from (4,3) we took U to (5,4) at turn5.\n\nThen from (5,4): U to (6,5) at turn6.\nThen from (6,5): S to (7,5) at turn7.\n\nSo the actions so far (5 actions):\n\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: S   -> at turn7: y=5.\n\nThen we need:\n\n  turn7: S  (to stay at y=5 at turn8)\n  turn8: U  (to y=6 at turn9)\n  turn9: U  (to y=7 at turn10)\n  turn10: U (to y=8 at turn11)\n  turn11: U (to y=9 at turn12)\n\nTotal actions: 5 (from start to (7,5)) + 5 = 10.\n\nBut we have another branch: at (5,4) we also considered D and S? but we went U.\n\nIs there a shorter path? \n\nWe started at (2,2). \n\nWe could have gone:\n\n  turn2: S (stay) -> (3,2)\n  turn3: U -> (4,3)\n  turn4: U -> (5,4)   [same as above?]\n\nOr:\n\n  turn2: D -> (3,1)\n  then turn3: U -> (4,2)\n  turn4: U -> (5,3)\n  turn5: U -> (6,4) [then we are at turn6, y=4]\n\nThen from (6,4): \n  turn6: U -> (7,5) [same as above?] \n\nSo same: 5 moves to (7,5).\n\nBut we might have gone faster? \n\nWhat if we went up as fast as possible:\n\n  turn2: U -> (3,3)\n  turn3: we cannot go U (because freeway4 at turn4 is blocked) -> so we must go S or D.\n      If we go S: (4,3) -> then turn4: U -> (5,4) -> then turn5: U -> (6,5) -> then turn6: we cannot go U (freeway6 at turn7 blocked) -> so we go S: (7,5) -> then same as above.\n\n  Total moves to (7,5): 5 moves.\n\nThen 5 more moves to (12,9): total 10.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the wait? \n\nWe need to avoid freeway6 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nWe were at y=5 at turn6. If we could be at y=5 earlier? \n\nBut we started at turn2 at y=2. The fastest to y=5 is 3 moves: \n  turn2: U -> y3=3\n  turn3: U -> y4=4\n  turn4: U -> y5=5 at turn5.\n\nBut at turn5, we are at y=5. Then at turn5 we can try to go to y=6 at turn6? \n  But freeway6 at turn6: blocked? \n      freeway6 at turn6: car3: [-27+4*(6-2)= -27+16=-11, -16+16=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 included -> blocked.\n  So we cannot go to y=6 at turn6.\n\nThen we have to wait at y=5 for turn5->turn6: stay -> at turn6: y=5 (safe? freeway5: [45+16=61,56+16=72] -> safe) \n  Then at turn6: we try to go to y=6 at turn7: freeway6 at turn7: [-27+4*5=-27+20=-7, -16+20=4] -> blocked -> cannot.\n  Then wait again: turn6->turn7: stay -> turn7: y=5 (freeway5: [45+20=65,56+20=76] -> safe)\n  Then at turn7: go to y=6 at turn8: freeway6 at turn8: [-27+4*6=-27+24=-3, -16+24=8] -> blocked.\n\nSo we have to wait until turn9? \n\nSo even if we get to y=5 at turn5, we have to wait until turn9 to go to y=6? Then we are at y=6 at turn9. Then we need 3 more moves to y=9: at turn12.\n\nTotal moves: \n  turn2: U -> 3\n  turn3: U -> 4\n  turn4: U -> 5\n  turn5: S -> 5\n  turn6: S -> 5\n  turn7: S -> 5\n  turn8: S -> 5\n  turn9: U -> 6\n  turn10: U ->7\n  turn11: U->8\n  turn12: U->9\n\nThat's 11 moves? \n\nBut we found a path in 10 moves? \n\nIn the earlier path we were at y=5 at turn7 (which is later) but then we only waited one turn (at turn7) and then went up at turn8 to y=6 at turn9? \n\nActually, in the earlier path we were at y=5 at turn7, then we did:\n\n  turn7: S -> so at turn8: still at y=5\n  turn8: U -> at turn9: y=6\n\nBut if we were at y=5 at turn5, we could do:\n\n  turn5: S -> turn6: y=5\n  turn6: S -> turn7: y=5\n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=5\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=6\n\nThen we are at y=6 at turn9, same as above.\n\nBut then the moves from y=2 to y=5: 3 moves, then 3 waits, then 4 moves to y=9: total 10 moves? \n\n3 (to y5) + 3 (waits) + 4 (to y9) = 10.\n\nBut in the first path we had 5 moves to get to y=5 at turn7, then 1 wait, then 4 moves: 5+1+4=10.\n\nSo both are 10.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H. Both are 10. \n\nBut we want the minimal H. Is there a path in less than 10?\n\nWe must get from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves up. And we must avoid the blocking on freeway4 at turn4 and freeway6 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe avoided freeway4 at turn4 by not being there at turn4. We were there at turn5 (safe).\n\nFor freeway6: we must avoid being at freeway6 at turns6,7,8. \n\nThe earliest we can be at freeway6 is turn? \n\nWe start at turn2 at y=2. The minimal turn to get to y=6: \n  turn2: y2=2\n  turn3: y3=3\n  turn4: y4=4\n  turn5: y5=5\n  turn6: y6=6 -> but turn6 is blocked.\n\nSo we must avoid turn6. Next: we can be at y=6 at turn7? -> blocked. turn8: blocked. turn9: safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=6 is turn9.\n\nThen the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn12? (because from y=6 at turn9, we need 3 moves: turn9->10: y7, turn10->11: y8, turn11->12: y9).\n\nBut we can also get to y=6 at turn9 by a different route? \n\nAlternatively, we might go down and then up to avoid waiting? but that would take more moves.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nWe have a path: \n\n  We choose the one that goes to y=5 at turn7 and then waits one turn and then goes up.\n\nBut we have two paths: one that goes to y=5 at turn5 and waits 3 turns, and one that goes to y=5 at turn7 and waits 1 turn. Both take 10 moves.\n\nWe can choose the one that is easier to output.\n\nLet's output the path we found earlier:\n\n  turn2: U -> to (3,3)\n  turn3: S -> to (4,3)\n  turn4: U -> to (5,4)\n  turn5: U -> to (6,5)\n  turn6: S -> to (7,5)\n  turn7: S -> to (8,5)\n  turn8: U -> to (9,6)\n  turn9: U -> to (10,7)\n  turn10: U -> to (11,8)\n  turn11: U -> to (12,9)\n\nBut wait, at turn7 we are at (7,5). We do S at turn7: then at turn8 we are at (8,5). Then at turn8 we do U: then at turn9 we are at (9,6). Then we do U at turn9: to (10,7), etc.\n\nBut we have 11 actions? \n\nActually, we take an action at turn2, turn3, ... turn11: that's 10 actions? \n\nThe turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 10 actions.\n\nThen at the end of the 10th action (at turn11) we are at y=9? \n\nBut the last action is at turn11: U -> to y=9 at turn12? \n\nNo: when we take an action at turn t, we move to the next state at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn11, we take an action (the 10th action) and then at turn12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we are at (0,2) at turn2. After H actions, we are at turn2+H, and we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\n  Turn 2: U\n  Turn 3: S\n  Turn 4: U\n  Turn 5: U\n  Turn 6: S\n  Turn 7: S\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n\nBut wait, after the action at turn11 (which is U), at turn12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the last action is at turn11, which is the 10th action? \n\nThe actions are from t1 to t1+H-1: \n   t1=2, so actions at 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, the last action is at turn11: U.\n\nBut we also need to check the states:\n\n  Start: turn2, y=2 -> safe (freeway2: not blocked at turn2)\n\n  turn2: U -> then at turn3: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn3: [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\n  turn3: S -> then at turn4: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn4: [-48,-25] -> safe.\n\n  turn4: U -> then at turn5: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn5: \n        car1: [-35+12*3, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe? but wait, at turn5: \n            car1: [-35+12*(5-2)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        car2: [1+12*3=37,12+36=48] -> safe.\n        car3: [37+36=73,48+36=84] -> safe.\n\n  turn5: U -> then at turn6: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn6: [45+4*4=45+16=61,56+16=72] -> safe.\n\n  turn6: S -> then at turn7: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn7: [45+20=65,56+20=76] -> safe.\n\n  turn7: S -> then at turn8: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn8: [45+24=69,56+24=80] -> safe.\n\n  turn8: U -> then at turn9: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn9: \n        car1: [45+4*7=45+28=73,56+28=84] -> safe.\n        car2: [9+28=37,20+28=48] -> safe.\n        car3: [-27+4*7=-27+28=1, -16+28=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  turn9: U -> then at turn10: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn10: \n        car1: [-59+12*8=-59+96=37, -48+96=48] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+96=109,24+96=120] -> safe.\n\n  turn10: U -> then at turn11: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn11: \n        car1: [-59+12*9=-59+108=49, -48+108=60] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+108=121,24+108=132] -> safe.\n\n  turn11: U -> then at turn12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a path with H=9? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn2+9-1 = turn10.\n\nSo at turn10, we must be at y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn10, we must have been at y=8 at turn9 and taken U at turn9.\n\nAt turn9: we must be at y=8 and then take U to y=9 at turn10.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn9, we must have been at y=7 at turn8 and taken U at turn8.\n\nAt turn8: we must be at y=7 and then take U to y=8 at turn9.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn8, we must have been at y=6 at turn7 and taken U at turn7.\n\nAt turn7: we must be at y=6 and then take U to y=7 at turn8.\n\nBut at turn7: if we are at y=6, then we must check freeway6 at turn7: which is blocked (car3: [-7,4] -> 0 in it). So we cannot be at y=6 at turn7.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=7 at turn8, so we cannot be at y=8 at turn9, so we cannot be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nThus, H=9 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=10 is the minimal.\n\nWe have a path of 10 actions.\n\nBut note: we have two paths.

We are confident.\n\nAnother path: \n  We could go from (2,2) to (3,1) and then ... but it would be the same length.\n\nWe'll output this.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path that gets to y=9 at turn11? (which would be H=10, same) but with different actions.\n\nWe have one.\n\nWe could also consider:\n\n  At turn2: U (to y=3 at turn3)\n  turn3: D (to y=2 at turn4) -> but then we are at y=2 at turn4: safe? freeway2: [1+48*2=97,48+96=144] -> safe.\n  then turn4: U (to y=3 at turn5) -> freeway3 at turn5: [0-24*3,23-72]=[-72,-49] -> safe.\n  turn5: U (to y=4 at turn6) -> freeway4 at turn6: \n        car1: [-35+12*4=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n        car2: [1+48=49,12+48=60] -> safe.\n        car3: [37+48=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n  turn6: U (to y=5 at turn7) -> freeway5: [45+20=65,56+20=76] -> safe.\n  turn7: S (to y=5 at turn8) -> safe.\n  turn8: U (to y=6 at turn9) -> freeway6 at turn9: safe (as above)\n  turn9: U (to y=7 at turn10) -> freeway7 at turn10: safe.\n  turn10: U (to y=8 at turn11) -> freeway8 at turn11: safe.\n  turn11: U (to y=9 at turn12) -> goal.\n\nThat's 10 moves too.\n\nBut we prefer the first one.\n\nWe'll stick with the first.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 2, the minimal number of turns required is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8 by strategically moving and waiting when necessary. The path is verified to be safe at each turn:\n\n- **Turn 2 (y=2)**: Action `U` moves to y=3 at turn 3. Freeway 2 at turn 2 is safe (car: [1, 48], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 3 (y=3)**: Action `S` stays at y=3 at turn 4. Freeway 3 at turn 3 is safe (car: [-24, -1], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 4 (y=3)**: Action `U` moves to y=4 at turn 5. Freeway 3 at turn 4 is safe (car: [-48, -25], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 5 (y=4)**: Action `U` moves to y=5 at turn 6. Freeway 4 at turn 5 is safe (cars: [1,12], [37,48], [73,84], 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 6 (y=5)**: Action `S` stays at y=5 at turn 7. Freeway 5 at turn 6 is safe (car: [61,72], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Action `S` stays at y=5 at turn 8. Freeway 5 at turn 7 is safe (car: [65,76], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 8 (y=5)**: Action `U` moves to y=6 at turn 9. Freeway 5 at turn 8 is safe (car: [69,80], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 9 (y=6)**: Action `U` moves to y=7 at turn 10. Freeway 6 at turn 9 is safe (cars: [73,84], [37,48], [1,12], 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 10 (y=7)**: Action `U` moves to y=8 at turn 11. Freeway 7 at turn 10 is safe (cars: [37,48], [109,120], 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 11 (y=8)**: Action `U` moves to y=9 at turn 12. Freeway 8 at turn 11 is safe (cars: [49,60], [121,132], 0 not in any span).\n\nAfter 10 actions, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 12. This is minimal, as H=9 is impossible due to blocking on freeway 6 at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 4.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right at a constant speed. The span is given at turn t_1=4, and for future turns, I need to compute where they are.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Since the player is at x=0 always, I think, because it's a vertical move, but the grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, I think? The position is (0, y_t), so x is fixed at 0, and y changes.\n\nAnd cars are on horizontal freeways, each at a fixed y level, moving horizontally.\n\nSo when I'm at y_t at turn t, I need to check if for freeway y_t, there is a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars there even if they cover x=0 at T. I only care about the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, the freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something. But collision is defined only for freeways y=1 to 8, I think. Let me check.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8.\" So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are safe. Also, when I'm moving between, at turn T, if I'm at y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, I need to avoid collision.\n\nBut at turn T, I'm at position (0, y_T), so if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need that no car on freeway y_T has span including 0 at turn T.\n\nIf I'm at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I start at (0,3) at turn t=4. y=3 is a freeway, so I need to check if at turn 4, on freeway 3, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions at turn t_1=4.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. In the update, left-moving: span moves left, right-moving: span moves right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway k, the cars are listed.\n\nLet me parse the car state for turn t_1=4.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? In the update, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I think, but here it's given as (head, tail), so I need to interpret.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]. But in the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for left-moving, head and tail such that h to τ, but since left-moving, h should be greater than τ? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving update: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so at t1, if [h, τ], with h > τ, then as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so τ < h.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span should be [tail, head], so here head=-24, tail=-35? But tail should be less than head for right-moving? -35 < -24, yes, so tail = -35, head = -24, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? No.\n\nThe notation is (head, tail), so for this car, head = -24, tail = -35, direction right.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is from tail to head, with tail < head. Here tail=-35, head=-24, so tail < head, yes. So span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12). Head=48, tail=37, but 37 < 48, so tail=37, head=48, span [37,48].\n\nBut direction right, and tail=37, head=48, so [37,48].\n\nNow, for left-moving, it would be head to tail with head > tail.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head=-48, tail=-25? But head=-48 < tail=-25, which is not consistent with head > tail for left-moving.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's look back at the update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ], and for left-moving, as time increases, both decrease, so h and τ, with h > τ, I assume, so the car is from τ to h, with τ left, h right? No.\n\nTypically, for a car, the head might be the front.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so if [h, τ] means from x=h to x=τ, with h > τ, so left end τ, right end h.\n\nThen moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, so left end τ, right end h, moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the input, for a car, (head, tail, dir, speed), so \"head\" probably means the front of the car, \"tail\" the rear.\n\nFor left-moving, the front is left when moving left? Let's think.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front is decreasing x, so at position, the head has smaller x when moving left? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the span.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ], and for left-moving, it moves left, so to have decreasing x, [h, τ] should have h > τ, so that when both decrease, it moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, both increase.\n\nIn the input, for a car, (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail, with dir left, so for example freeway 3: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-48, -25]? But -48 < -25, so if [h, τ] with h=-48, τ=-25, then h < τ, but for left-moving, if h < τ, then [h, τ] with h < τ, and moving left, both decrease, so it moves left, but the span is from min to max or what?\n\nI think there's ambiguity.\n\nLet's assume that the span is always given as [left, right] or something, but the notation is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps in the input, for any car, (head, tail) defines the span, and direction says how it moves.\n\nBut for collision, we care about the interval containing x.\n\nFor a car, at t1, the span is an interval on x-axis.\n\nFor left-moving car, the update is span(T) = [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so at t1, the positions are h and τ, and both decrease with time.\n\nSo the span at t1 is between min(h,τ) and max(h,τ), but since it's [h, τ], it might not be ordered.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should for each car, at t1, the span is from the smaller to larger x, but the update depends on direction.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nFor freeway 3: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-48, -25], but -48 < -25, so the interval is from -48 to -25, which is length 23, but moving left, so at later time, both decrease, so the left end decreases, right end decreases, so the car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1 first car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But in input it's (head, tail) = (-24, -35), so for right-moving, [τ, h], so τ should be tail, h head, so if tail=-35, head=-24, then [τ, h] = [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12), so tail=37, head=48, [37,48].\n\nFor left-moving, freeway 3: (head, tail) = (-48, -25), direction left, so for left-moving, span [h, τ] = [-48, -25], which is from -48 to -25.\n\nSince -48 < -25, it's fine, the car occupies x from -48 to -25.\n\nAt turn T, for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, on freeway k, if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan is the interval, so 0 between left and right end.\n\nAlso, for the player, at turn T, position (0, y_T), so if y_T between 1 and 8, and for that y, some car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=3.\n\nFirst, I need to check if at t=4, on freeway 3, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 3 has one car: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nSpan at t=4: [ -48, -25 ] since it's left-moving, but [h,τ] = [-48,-25], so from -48 to -25.\n\n0 is between -48 and -25? -48 <= 0 <= -25? -48 <= 0 is true, 0 <= -25 is false, so 0 not in [-48,-25], since -25 < 0? -25 is less than 0, so -48 to -25, all negative, so 0 not in interval, so safe at t=4 on y=3.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 turns if I move up each time, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nActions: U, D, S, so I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut moving down might be necessary to avoid, but since I need to reach 9, down might not help, but I can stay to wait.\n\nBut staying might be needed if moving up would cause collision.\n\nNow, the cars move, so the spans change over time.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway, for each turn, which cars cover x=0.\n\nBut turns start from t=4, and I need to find when I can move through each level.\n\nSince I move one y per turn, except when I stay, y doesn't change.\n\nEach turn, I choose action, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo the path in y is a sequence where each step changes by at most 1.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min steps are 6 up moves, but I might have stays or down moves, which increase H.\n\nI want min H, so I should avoid unnecessary moves, so ideally go up directly, but if blocked, I might need to wait or detour.\n\nDetour down might not help since cars are on fixed y, and I need to go up, so probably staying or waiting is better than moving down, but moving down could be to avoid a future collision or something, but let's see the car movements.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars at t=4, and their speeds and directions.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: car1: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 12) so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nCar2: (48, 37, right, 12) span [37,48]\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nAt turn T, car1 span: since right-moving, [ -35 + 12(T-4), -24 + 12(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly car2: [37 + 12(T-4), 48 + 12(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSo right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-95, -48] since tail=-95, head=-48? Input (-48, -95, right, 48), so head=-48, tail=-95, so for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nSpeed 48.\n\nAt T, span: [-95 + 48(T-4), -48 + 48(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3: y=3\n\nCar: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nLeft-moving, so span [h, τ] = [-48, -25] at t=4\n\nAt T, span: [ -48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4) ]\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12) so head=0, tail=-11, right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t=4, span [-11,0], so x=0 is included? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0], so at t=4, on freeway 4, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut I'm not on y=4 at t=4, I'm on y=3, so for now, it's ok, but if I go to y=4 at some turn, I need to check.\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25? Input (36,25,right,12), so head=36, tail=25, span [25,36]\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12) head=-48, tail=-59, so tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nAt T, first car span: [-11 +12(T-4), 0 +12(T-4)] = [-11 +12dt, 12dt] where dt=T-4\n\nSecond car: [25 +12dt, 36 +12dt]\n\nThird car: [-59 +12dt, -48 +12dt]\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nInput (-48,-59,right,4), so head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48] at t=4\n\nAt T: [-59 +4(T-4), -48 +4(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48]\n\nSecond car: (28,17,right,4) head=28, tail=17, span [17,28]\n\nThird car: (-8,-19,right,4) head=-8, tail=-19, span [-19,-8]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nAt T: first car: [-59 +4dt, -48 +4dt]\n\nSecond: [17+4dt, 28+4dt]\n\nThird: [-19+4dt, -8+4dt] where dt=T-4\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nSimilar to freeway 1.\n\nCar1: (-24,-35,right,12) span [-35,-24]\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,12) span [37,48]\n\nAt T: car1: [-35+12dt, -24+12dt]\n\nCar2: [37+12dt, 48+12dt]\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nSame as freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,12), (48,37,right,12) so same as y=7 and y=1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at t=4 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=3, t=4.\n\nFirst, at t=4, y=3: freeway 3 has car span [-48,-25] at t=4, -48 to -25, all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to move to higher y.\n\nThe target is y=9, so I should move up when possible.\n\nBut let's see for each freeway, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, find times T when for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need that for no car, 0 in span.\n\nSo for each k, find T such that it is safe.\n\nThen, for my path, at each turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that T.\n\nAlso, y_T must be integer, and I change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen the safe times are the gaps.\n\nStart with freeway y=1.\n\nCars: car1: span at T: [-35 +12dt, -24 +12dt] where dt=T-4\n\n0 in this interval if -35 +12dt <= 0 <= -24 +12dt\n\nSimilarly car2: [37+12dt, 48+12dt], 0 in this if 37+12dt <=0 <=48+12dt, but 37+12dt >0 for dt>=0, since min at dt=0 is 37>0, so 0 < 37+12dt always, so 0 not in [37+12dt,48+12dt] for all T, since left end >=37>0.\n\nSo only car1 can cover x=0.\n\nCar1: 0 in [-35+12dt, -24+12dt] if -35+12dt <= 0 <= -24+12dt\n\nWhich is 12dt <= 35 and 0 <= -24+12dt so 24 <=12dt so dt >= 24/12 = 2\n\nAnd 12dt <=35 so dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so dt=2 or 3? Let's see inequalities.\n\n-35+12dt <= 0 <= -24+12dt\n\nFirst inequality: -35+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=35 => dt <= 35/12 = 2 + 11/12 ≈2.916\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24+12dt => 12dt >=24 => dt >=2\n\nSo for dt >=2 and dt <= 2.916, but dt integer since turns, T integer.\n\ndt = T-4, T turn number, integer.\n\nSo dt integer, so dt >=2 and dt <=2 since 2.916, so dt=2.\n\ndt=2: T-4=2, T=6\n\nAt dt=2, car1 span: -35+12*2 = -35+24= -11, -24+12*2= -24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt dt=3, -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nAt dt=1, -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=6, y=1 is unsafe because of car1.\n\nCar2 never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCar: (-48,-95,right,48)? Input (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-95, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-95,-48] at t=4\n\nAt T: [-95 +48dt, -48 +48dt]\n\n0 in this if -95+48dt <=0 <= -48+48dt\n\nFirst: -95+48dt <=0 => 48dt <=95 => dt <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+48dt => 48dt >=48 => dt >=1\n\nSo dt >=1 and dt <=1.979, so dt=1\n\nT-4=1, T=5\n\nAt dt=1, span: -95+48= -47, -48+48=0, so [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nAt dt=0, [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=2, -95+96=1, -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=5.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCar: left-moving, span at T: [ -48 -24dt, -25 -24dt ]\n\n0 in this if -48-24dt <=0 <= -25-24dt\n\nBut left part: -48-24dt <=0 always true since both negative? -48-24dt <=0 is true for all dt, since -48-24dt <0.\n\nBut right part: 0 <= -25-24dt? Which is 0 <= - (25 +24dt) <0, always false.\n\nSo 0 <= -25-24dt is impossible because -25-24dt <= -25 <0.\n\nSo for all T, 0 not in span, so freeway 3 is always safe.\n\nIs that right?\n\nSpan [ -48 -24dt, -25 -24dt ], since both ends negative and decreasing, min x is -48-24dt, max x is -25-24dt, both negative for all dt, so 0 not in interval, yes, always safe.\n\nSo y=3 no problem.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) span at T: [-11 +12dt, 0 +12dt] = [-11+12dt, 12dt]\n\n0 in this if -11+12dt <=0 <= 12dt\n\nBut 0 <= 12dt always for dt>=0? dt=T-4>=0, so 12dt >=0, 0 <=12dt true only if 12dt >=0, which is true, but 0 <= 12dt means dt >=0, which is always, but the inequality is 0 <= 12dt, which is true for dt >=0, since 12*0=0.\n\nBut also -11+12dt <=0.\n\nSo 0 in if -11+12dt <=0 and 0 <= 12dt.\n\n0 <= 12dt: since dt integer >=0, for dt=0, 12*0=0, so 0 <=0 true.\n\nFor dt>0, 12dt>0, true.\n\n-11+12dt <=0 => 12dt <=11 => dt <= 11/12 <1, so dt=0 only.\n\ndt=0: T=4\n\nAt T=4, span [-11,0], so 0 in.\n\nFor dt>=1, -11+12dt >= -11+12=1>0, and 12dt>0, so [something positive, positive], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car covers 0 only at T=4.\n\nNow second car: (36,25,right,12) span [25+12dt, 36+12dt], min 25>0, so always >0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12)?

Let's see the action sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at position, and I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc., up to turn t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, I reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1 =4.\n\nAt turn 4, I am at y_4 =3.\n\nI choose a_4, which sets y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nThen at turn 5, I am at y_5, choose a_5, and so on, until at some turn T, I am at y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions H is such that after H actions, from turn 4 to turn 4+H-1, I have actions, and at turn 4+H, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, H=0, but I start at y=3, not 9.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 6, if I move up each turn, after 6 up moves, I reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nStart: t=4, y=3\n\nAfter a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nAfter a_5=U, y_5=5? y_5 after a_4 is at turn 5.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 4: at y_4=3, choose a_4, set y_5\n\nTurn 5: at y_5, choose a_5, set y_6\n\n...\n\nTurn T: at y_T, choose a_T, set y_{T+1}\n\nI reach when y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSince at turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T=9, I am done, no need for further action? But the action sequence is to reach position at turn t_1 + H -1 or something.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, but it says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, after the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter choosing action a_τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nThe actions are for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for turn index: let τ = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAction at τ: a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nThen after the last action at τ = t_1 + H -1, we have y_{ (t_1 + H -1) +1 } = y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at the beginning of turn t_1 + H -1, before action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care as long as at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), and we might take an action, but since we are already at 9, we can do S or whatever, but the position is reached at that turn.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at t_1=4, if I can be at y=9 at turn 4 + H -1.\n\nStart at t=4, y=3.\n\nIf I move up each turn, after 6 up moves:\n\nt=4: y=3, action U, set y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, action U, set y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, action U, set y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, action U, set y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7, action U, set y9=8\n\nt=9: y=8, action U, set y10=9\n\nThen at turn 9, y=8, not 9.\n\nAt turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 4 + H -1\n\nSet this to 10, so 4 + H -1 =10, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=10? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =4 to 4+H-1.\n\nAt turn 4+H-1, position is y_{4+H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 10, y=9, so 4 + H -1 =10, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9: all U, and at t=10, we are at y=10? No.\n\nAfter action at t=9, y10 is set to 9.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nAt turn 10, position y10, which is set by action at t=9.\n\nIf at turn 9, y9=8, action U, then y10=9.\n\nThen at turn 10, y10=9, so we are at (0,9) at turn 10.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with t_1=4, so 4 + H -1 =10, thus H-1=6, H=7.\n\nAnd actions at t=4 to t=9 (6 actions? t=4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 6 actions for H=7? t from 0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, actions at τ = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1: so τ=4,5,6,7,8,9 for H=7? t from 0 to 6? t=0: τ=4+0=4, t=1: τ=5, ..., t=5: τ=9, t=6: τ=10? t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=7, t=0 to 6, τ=4 to 10.\n\nBut actions at τ=4 to τ=10? But at τ=10, if I take action, it sets y11, but I need y_{τ} for τ=10 to be 9, which is before action at τ=10.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nPosition y_τ is at the beginning of turn τ.\n\nThen I take action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nThe sequence: for turns τ = t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to τ = t_1 + H -1, I take actions a_τ.\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, with t_1=4, y_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf I reach at turn 10, y10=9, so 4 + H -1 =10, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nAnd actions at τ=4 to τ=9 (since τ = t_1 to t_1+H-1 =4 to 4+6=10? t_1+H-1=4+7-1=10.\n\nτ from t_1 to t_1+H-1: for H=7, τ=4 to 10.\n\nBut at τ=10, I take action a_{10}, which sets y_{11}, but at turn τ=10, I am already at y_{10}=9, so I can take S, for example.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 10.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to specify actions from τ=4 to τ=10 for H=7.\n\nBut at τ=10, I am at y=9, and I take an action, but since I am already at 9, I can take S, and y11=9, but it's fine.\n\nBut to minimize H, I might reach earlier.\n\nBack to the car avoidance.\n\nI am at t=4, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nBut let's see for each turn and y, if it is safe.\n\nStart: t=4, y=3: safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I choose action a_4.\n\nI can go U to y=4, or D to y=2, or S stay y=3.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U or S.\n\nIf I go U, y5=4.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4, is it safe?\n\nFreeway y=4 unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nT=4 is turn 4, but at turn 5, T=5.\n\nFor y=4, unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nT=5 is safe, since not 4 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, T=8 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=5, y=4 should be safe.\n\nt=5, T=5.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at T=4 and T=8, so T=5 safe.\n\nIf I take a_4=U, then at t=5, y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I can take a_5=U to y=5.\n\ny=5: freeway 5 unsafe at T=16,17,18, which are later, so for now, T=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, y=5, if I go to y=6, but let's see.\n\nBut at t=6, if I am on y=6, it might be unsafe.\n\nFirst, let's list the path.\n\nAssume I move up directly:\n\nTurn 4: at y=3, action U, set y5=4\n\nTurn 5: at y=4, action U, set y6=5\n\nTurn 6: at y=5, action U, set y7=6\n\nBut at turn 6, I am at y=5, which is safe, since y=5 unsafe only later.\n\nThen set y7=6.\n\nTurn 7: at y=6, now y=6 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=7, which is unsafe.\n\nAt turn 7, y=6, and T=7, which is unsafe for y=6.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at turn 7, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 7, if y=6, and T=7, freeway 6 unsafe, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=6 at other unsafe times.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, safe (since unsafe only t=4,8)\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, but at T=7, y=6 unsafe, so collision if I am there.\n\nCannot be on y=6 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, if I were on y=6, but in this path, at t=6 I am at y=5.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=7.\n\nOptions: at t=6, instead of moving up, I could stay or move down, but moving down might not help.\n\nI could delay moving to y=6.\n\nOr at t=7, I could be not on y=6.\n\nBut let's list all constraints.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn t=4+H-1.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=6\n\ny=2: unsafe t=5\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,8\n\ny=5: unsafe t=16,17,18 (later, ignore)\n\ny=6: unsafe t=6,7,8\n\ny=7: unsafe t=6\n\ny=8: unsafe t=6\n\ny=9: safe\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=3.\n\nI need to go through the freeways.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe from t=6 to t=8, I need to be on y=6 only outside these times, or avoid it.\n\nBut t=6,7,8 unsafe, so I can be on y=6 only at t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=6, so can be only other times.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe only t=6, so safe at t=5,7,8,etc.\n\nSimilarly y=8 unsafe only t=6.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=8 at some point.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6, so I can be on y=8 at t=5,7,8,9,etc except t=6.\n\nBut t=8 might be ok if I can.\n\nNow, let's find a path with minimal H.\n\nFirst, can I reach by t=9?\n\nAt t=9, y=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =9, t_1=4, so 4+H-1=9, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=9? τ = t_1 to t_1+H-1=4 to 4+6-1=9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=9 at turn 9.\n\nFrom t=4 y=3 to t=9 y=9 in 5 steps? Turns: t=4 to t=9, that's 5 turns? Positions from start of t=4 to start of t=9.\n\nAt start t=4, y=3.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at start t=9, y=9.\n\nThe actions affect the next position.\n\nTo increase y from 3 to 9, delta y=6, so I need at least 6 up moves, but with possible stays or down, but down would require more up moves, so minimal actions is 6 up moves with no down or stay, but that would take 6 actions, from t=4 to t=9? Let's see.\n\nWith 6 up moves:\n\nStart t=4, y=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nThen at t=10, y=10=9? y10=9.\n\nBut we want at t=9, y=9.\n\nIn this, at t=9, y=9 is not reached; at t=9, y=9 only if I reach earlier.\n\nTo have y_t=9 at turn t, I need to have moved up before.\n\nFor example, if at some turn, I am at y=8, and I take U, then at next turn y=9.\n\nBut for y_t=9 at turn t, it means that at the beginning of turn t, I am at y=9, so I must have arrived there by previous action.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is if I move up from y=8 at turn t-1.\n\nAt turn t-1, I am at y=8, take U, then y_t=9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, I need to be at y=8 at turn T-1 and take U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn T-1, I need to be at y=7 at T-2 or something.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nFor min H, to reach at turn T=9, y9=9.\n\nThen I need y8=8 at turn 8, and take a8=U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y8=8 at turn 8, etc.\n\nNow, from start.\n\nAt t=4, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=8 by t=8 to take U at t=8 to have y9=9.\n\nOr directly if I can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nEarliest possible: if I move up each turn from t=4.\n\nBut with car constraints.\n\nPath to t=9 y=9:\n\nNeed to be at y=8 at t=8, and take U at t=8.\n\nSo positions:\n\nAt t=8, y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=8, it is safe, since t=6 only.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=8, I need to come from y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, take U to y8=8.\n\nOr from y=8 at t=7, take S to y8=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's work backwards or forward.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe at t=6,7,8, I need to avoid being on y=6 at those times.\n\nSo I must be on y=6 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nt=5 or t=9 or later.\n\nBut t=9 I need to be at y=9, so not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=5 possible.\n\nNow, similarly for other levels.\n\nLet me list the safe times for each y where I need to be.\n\ny=4: safe except t=4,8\n\ny=5: safe all relevant times (t=4 to 9)\n\ny=6: safe except t=6,7,8, so safe at t=4,5,9,... but t=4 I am at y=3, not 6. t=5 possible.\n\ny=7: safe except t=6\n\ny=8: safe except t=6\n\nNow, I start at t=4, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 must be visited only at safe times, which are t=5 or t=9 or later.\n\nt=9 I am at y=9, so not on 6. t=5 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, t=4 not possible for y=6.\n\nSo only possible to be on y=6 at t=5.\n\nt=5 is safe for y=6? y=6 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so t=5 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, other times not possible except later, but later not needed.\n\nSo I must be on y=6 at turn t=5.\n\nBecause that's the only safe time between t=4 and t=9.\n\nt=4: y=3, t=5: can be y=6? How?\n\nAt t=4, y=3, I can take action to go to y=4, or stay, or down, but not directly to y=6.\n\nEach turn, y changes by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=4, at t=5, y can be 2,3, or 4.\n\nCannot be 6 directly.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=6 at t=5.\n\nt=5 position depends on action at t=4.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4, so y5 can be 2,3,4.\n\nNot 6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, y6 can be from y5, so 1,2,3,4,5 or something.\n\nBut y=6 at t=6 is unsafe, and also not reachable from t=5 y<=4.\n\nLet's list possible y at each turn.\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nt=5: y=2,3,4 (depending on a4)\n\nt=6: from y=2,3,4, y=1,2,3,4,5\n\nt=7: from that, y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\netc.\n\nBut y=6 must be safe, so only at t=5 or t=9.\n\nBut at t=5, y can be 2,3,4, not 6.\n\nAt t=9, if I am at y=9, not 6.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 at all between t=4 and t=9, except possibly at t=9, but y=9.\n\nSo I must never be on y=6 during the path? But I need to go from y=5 to y=7, so I must pass through y=6 at some turn.\n\nContradiction?\n\nUnless I can skip it, but I can only change by 1, so I must be on y=6 at some point.\n\nBut the only safe times for y=6 are t=5 and t=9, but t=5 unreachable from start, and t=9 I am at y=9.\n\nt=9 y=9, not 6.\n\nSo how can I be on y=6?\n\nPerhaps at t=10 or later, but for minimal H, I want to reach early.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at t=9? But at t=9, if I am at y=6, then I need to go to y=9 later, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=6, then I need three more up moves to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut larger H.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on y=6 at t=5? Impossible.\n\nThe safe times for y=6 are t=5 or t>=9.\n\nt=5 impossible, so must be at t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other levels.\n\nSo to min H, I should be on y=6 as soon as possible after t=8, i.e., t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I can be at y=6.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at later turn.\n\nFirst, let's find a path.\n\nStart t=4, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me assume I reach at turn T.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1.\n\nFor min H, min T.\n\nT min when I move up directly, but with constraints, T=10 in direct path, but with collision at t=7.\n\nNow, to avoid y=6 at t=7.\n\nIn direct path, at t=7, y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=6 at t=7.\n\nOptions: at t=6, instead of moving to y=6, I could stay at y=5 or move down to y=4.\n\nBut if I stay at y=5 at t=6, then at t=6, y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=6, I can choose action.\n\nIf I take U, y7=6, but at t=7, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S, y7=5, then at t=7, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can take U to y8=6, but at t=8, y=6, and t=8 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I take U at t=7, y8=6, then at t=8, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S at t=7, y8=5, then at t=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, take U to y9=6, then at t=9, y=6, which is safe? y=6 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so t=9 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, take U to y10=7.\n\nThen at t=10, y=7, which is safe except t=6, so t=10 safe.\n\nTake U to y11=8.\n\nt=11, y=8, safe except t=6, so safe.\n\nTake U to y12=9.\n\nThen at t=12, y=12=9? y12=9.\n\nBut we need y_T=9 at some T.\n\nHere at t=12, y=9.\n\nThen T=12, t_1 + H -1 =12, 4+H-1=12, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=11? τ=4 to 11 for H=8? Let's calculate.\n\ny_T=9 at T=12.\n\nT= t_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =12, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions at τ = t_1 to t_1+H-1 =4 to 4+9-1=12.\n\nSo actions at τ=4 to 12.\n\nAt τ=12, I take action, but y12=9 already.\n\nBut H=9, large.\n\nFrom above, I was at t=8, y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at t=9, I could go earlier.\n\ny=6 safe at t=9.\n\nAt t=8, I am at y=5, I can take U to y9=6, but at t=9, y=6.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster.\n\nAnother idea: avoid y=6 altogether by going around, but I can only move vertically, so I must go through each level.\n\nUnless I stay or something, but I must visit y=6 to go to y=7.\n\nSo I have to be on y=6 at some turn.\n\nThe earliest safe turn after t=8 is t=9.\n\nSo be on y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, move up to y=9 at t=12, as above.\n\nBut can I reach y=6 at t=9 with fewer turns?\n\nFrom start.\n\nAt t=4, y=3.\n\nI can move up or stay.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=9.\n\nBut y=6 at t=9.\n\nThe position at t=9 is y=6.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=9, I need to come from y=5 or y=6 or y=7 at t=8.\n\nIf from y=5 at t=8, take U to y9=6.\n\nIf from y=6 at t=8, take S to y9=6.\n\nIf from y=7 at t=8, take D to y9=6.\n\nBut y=6 at t=8 is unsafe, so cannot be on y=6 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=8 is safe, since unsafe only t=6.\n\ny=5 at t=8 safe.\n\nSo possible to be at y=5 or y=7 at t=8, then move to y=6 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=5 or y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut y=7 at t=8: to be at y=7 at t=8, need from earlier.\n\nLet's find a path to y=6 at t=9.\n\nFirst, at t=8, I need to be at y=5 or y=6 or y=7, but y=6 unsafe, so y=5 or y=7.\n\nIf at y=5 at t=8, take U to y9=6.\n\nIf at y=7 at t=8, take D to y9=6.\n\nNow, to reach y=5 at t=8 or y=7 at t=8.\n\nFrom start, min time.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=4, I can move up with some stays or down, but down would delay.\n\nWith no delay, from t=4 y=3 to t=5 y=4, t=6 y=5, t=7 y=6, but t=7 y=6 unsafe, so I cannot be at y=6 at t=7.\n\nSo I need to be slower.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=3, take S, then y5=3\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, take U to y6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, take U to y7=5\n\nAt t=7, y=5, take U to y8=6, but at t=8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=7, y=5, instead of U, take S, then y8=5\n\nThen at t=8, y=5, take U to y9=6\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=9, y=6, take U to y10=7\n\nt=10, y=7, take U to y11=8\n\nt=11, y=8, take U to y12=9\n\nThen at t=12, y=12=9.\n\nT=12, H-1=8, H=9 as before.\n\nBut earlier at t=8, I have y=5.\n\nCan I reach y=7 at t=8?\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nFrom start, min: t=4 y=3 U, y5=4\n\nt=5 y=4 U, y6=5\n\nt=6 y=5, but if I take U, y7=6, but at t=7 y=6 unsafe, and also for t=8, if I want y=7 at t=8, from y=6 at t=7 take U to y8=7, but t=7 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=6 y=5, take S, y7=5\n\nThen at t=7 y=5, take U to y8=6, but y8=6 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=6 y=5, take D to y7=4\n\nThen at t=7 y=4, take U to y8=5\n\nThen at t=8 y=5, as before.\n\nOr from y=4 at t=7, take U twice, but to y=7 at t=8, need from y=6 at t=7 take U, but y=6 at t=7 unsafe.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at t=8 directly.\n\nThe only way to have y=7 at t=8 is from y=6 at t=7 or y=7 at t=7 or y=8 at t=7.\n\ny=6 at t=7 unsafe, y=8 at t=7: to be at y=8 at t=7, need from earlier.\n\nAt t=7, y can be from y=6 at t=6 or etc.\n\nBut y=6 at t=6 unsafe, so at t=6, y cannot be 6, so at t=7, y can be 5,6,7, but y=6 unsafe, so y=5 or 7.\n\nIf y=7 at t=7, then at t=7, y=7, which is safe since t=7 not 6.\n\nThen take S to y8=7.\n\nOr take U to y8=8, etc.\n\nBut to have y=7 at t=7.\n\nHow to reach y=7 at t=7.\n\nFrom start, t=4 y=3 U, y5=4\n\nt=5 y=4 U, y6=5\n\nt=6 y=5, take U to y7=6, but at t=7 y=6 unsafe, not good.\n\nTake S at t=6, y7=5, not 7.\n\nOr take D, y7=4.\n\nCannot reach y=7 at t=7 from below because of y=6 constraint.\n\nSimilarly, from above, but I start below.\n\nSo it seems impossible to be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I can be at y=5, as in the first path.\n\nOr at y=4, or y=3, but not higher directly.\n\nSo the only possibility to reach y=6 at t=9 is from y=5 at t=8.\n\nAnd to be at y=5 at t=8, I can be at y=5 at t=7 and take S, or at y=4 at t=7 take U, etc.\n\nBut with min time.\n\nFrom start, to be at y=5 at t=8.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=4 y=3, take U to y5=4\n\nt=5 y=4, take U to y6=5\n\nt=6 y=5, but at t=6, y=5 safe.\n\nNow, I need to not go to y=6 at t=7.\n\nSo at t=6, take S, so y7=5\n\nThen at t=7 y=5, take S or U.\n\nIf take U, y8=6, but at t=8 y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=7 y=5, take S, y8=5\n\nThen at t=8 y=5, take U to y9=6\n\nAt t=9 y=6, safe.\n\nThen t=9 y=6, take U to y10=7\n\nt=10 y=7, take U to y11=8\n\nt=11 y=8, take U to y12=9\n\nThen at t=12, y=12=9.\n\nT=12, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: from t=4 to t=11.\n\nBut at t=8, I have y=5, which is safe.\n\nCan I reach y=5 earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=6, I am at y=5, and I stay at t=6 and t=7, so I waste turns.\n\nIf I can be at y=5 later, but I need to be at y=5 at t=8.\n\nFrom t=4, I can go slower to arrive at y=5 at t=8.\n\nFor example, t=4 y=3 S, y5=3\n\nt=5 y=3 U, y6=4\n\nt=6 y=4 U, y7=5\n\nt=7 y=5 S, y8=5\n\nSame as above.\n\nOr t=4 U, y5=4\n\nt=5 S, y6=4\n\nt=6 U, y7=5\n\nt=7 S, y8=5\n\nThen same.\n\nSo no better.\n\nBut at t=7, y=5, instead of staying, I could move up to y=6 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nOr move down, but worse.\n\nSo I think H=9 is the best so far.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier by being on y=6 at t=9 and then moving faster, but from y=6 at t=9 to y=9 at t=12, same as above.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=8 or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are only unsafe at t=6, I can be on them at t=7 or 8.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut as before, I cannot because to be at y=7 at t=7, I need to be at y=6 at t=6 and take U, but y=6 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nOr at y=7 at t=6 take S, but y=7 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible at t=7.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, I can be at y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=8: safe, since unsafe only t=6.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7 take U.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=7, impossible as above.\n\nFrom y=8 at t=7 take S, but to be at y=8 at t=7, need from below, same issue.\n\nSo cannot be at high y early.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=6 is t=9.\n\nThen y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence to reach y=9 at t=12:\n\nAt t=4, y=3, action U, set y5=4\n\nAt t=5, y=4, action U, set y6=5\n\nAt t=6, y=5, action S, set y7=5  (stay to avoid moving to y=6 unsafe)\n\nAt t=7, y=5, action S, set y8=5  (stay again)\n\nAt t=8, y=5, action U, set y9=6\n\nAt t=9, y=6, action U, set y10=7\n\nAt t=10, y=7, action U, set y11=8\n\nAt t=11, y=8, action U, set y12=9\n\nThen at t=12, y=12=9, so for T=12, y_T=9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =12, 4 + H -1=12, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions at τ=4 to 12? τ from 4 to t_1+H-1=4+9-1=12.\n\nBut at τ=12, I take action a12, which sets y13, but since I am at y12=9, I can take S, for example.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=4 to t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, I am already at y=9, so action at t=12 is not necessary, but since H=9, I need to include it.\n\nI can have fewer actions if I reach earlier.\n\nBut in this case, I reached at t=12.\n\nEarlier in the direct path without cars, I could reach at t=10 with y10=9, but with cars, I had collision.\n\nCan I reach by t=10?\n\nAt t=10, y=9.\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at t=9 and take U.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 safe except t=6, so t=9 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=9, need from y=7 at t=8 take U, or from y=8 at t=8 take S, or from y=9 take D, but not.\n\nSo need at t=8, y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=8 safe.\n\ny=7 at t=8 safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 or y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=8, need from y=6 at t=7 take U, but y=6 at t=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=8, need from y=7 at t=7 take U, but to be at y=7 at t=7, need from y=6 at t=6 take U, but y=6 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at high enough at t=8.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 by t=10.\n\nSimilarly for t=11: y=9 at t=11.\n\nNeed at t=10, y=8, take U.\n\ny=8 at t=10 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10, need at t=9 y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=9 safe.\n\ny=7 at t=9 safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 or y=8 at t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=7.\n\nHow to reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=8, y=6 or y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut y=6 at t=8 unsafe, so y=7 or y=8 at t=8.\n\ny=7 at t=8: safe.\n\ny=8 at t=8: safe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=8, need at t=7 y=6 or y=7.\n\ny=6 at t=7 unsafe, so only y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=7, need at t=6 y=6 or y=7.\n\ny=6 at t=6 unsafe, y=7 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 at t=7 or t=8 directly.\n\nBut at t=9, I can be at y=7 from y=6 at t=8 take U, but y=6 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nOr from y=7 at t=8 take S.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=8, same problem.\n\nSo the only way is to be at lower level and move up after t=8.\n\nThus, the path I have with H=9 seems necessary.\n\nBut in my path, I have two stays at t=6 and t=7.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one stay.\n\nFor example, at t=6, instead of staying, I could move down, but that might not help.\n\nOr at t=5, I can stay or something.\n\nLet's list the path with times.\n\nI need to be at y=6 at t=9.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=4 to y=6 at t=9, delta y=3, min 3 steps, but with constraints.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, action to set y5.\n\nIf I take U, y5=4\n\nThen at t=5, y=4, action to set y6.\n\nIf U, y6=5\n\nThen at t=6, y=5, action: if I take U, y7=6, but t=7 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf take S, y7=5\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, action: if U, y8=6, t=8 y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo take S, y8=5\n\nThen at t=8, y=5, action U, y9=6\n\nThen at t=9, y=6.\n\nActions: a4=U, a5=U, a6=S, a7=S, a8=U\n\nThen to go to y=9: a9=U to y10=7, a10=U to y11=8, a11=U to y12=9\n\nSo actions from t=4 to t=11 for the moves, but to have y12=9, we need up to a11.\n\nThen T=12, H=9 actions from t=4 to t=12? Earlier.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =12, H=9, actions at τ=4 to 12.\n\nAt τ=12, I take action, but y12=9 already, so I can take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut a9, a10, a11 are U, a12 can be S.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nIf at t=11, y=9.\n\nThen need at t=10, y=8, take U.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10.\n\ny=8 at t=10 safe.\n\nNeed at t=9, y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf at t=9, y=7, take U to y10=8, then at t=10 y=8, take U to y11=9.\n\nOr at t=9 y=8, take U to y10=9, then at t=10 y=9, but for t=11 y=9, need different.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nAt t=9, y=7.\n\nHow to be at y=7 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=8, y=6 or y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=6 at t=8 unsafe, so y=7 or y=8 at t=8.\n\ny=7 at t=8: safe.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=8, need at t=7 y=6 or y=7.\n\ny=6 at t=7 unsafe, so y=7 at t=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=7, need at t=6 y=6 or y=7.\n\ny=6 at t=6 unsafe, y=7 at t=6 unsafe, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot be at y=7 at t=9 with fewer steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with the path above.\n\nBut in the path, at t=6 and t=7, I stayed at y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at those times.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to output for turn t_1=4.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S or U, but since at y=9, S to stay.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 12, so action at turn 12 is included.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 4 to turn 12.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=4.\n\nSequence of actions: a_4, a_5, ..., a_{12}\n\nWith H=9, actions at t=4 to t=12.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 4: a_{4}\n\nTurn 5: a_{5}\n\n...\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\nAnd a_{12} can be S.\n\nIn the sequence above, a4=U, a5=U, a6=S, a7=S, a8=U, a9=U (to y10=7), a10=U (to y11=8), a11=U (to y12=9), a12=S (y13=9)\n\nBut at turn 12, y12=9, so we are at (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one action, but I think not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly from y=5 to y=7 by moving up twice, but no, each turn only one step.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can be on y=6 at t=9 with different path.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=3, take S, y5=3\n\nt=5 y=3, take U, y6=4\n\nt=6 y=4, take U, y7=5\n\nt=7 y=5, take U, but if U, y8=6, unsafe, so take S, y8=5\n\nt=8 y=5, take U, y9=6\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr at t=7 y=5, take D to y8=4, then at t=8 y=4, take U to y9=5, not 6.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, from t=9 to t=12, I go U,U,U to reach y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, let's write the actions step by step.\n\nAlso, at each turn, I need to ensure no collision.\n\nIn the path:\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\na4=U, set y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, safe (t=5 not unsafe for y=4)\n\na5=U, set y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\na6=S, set y7=5 (stay)\n\nt=7: y=5, safe\n\na7=S, set y8=5 (stay)\n\nt=8: y=5, safe\n\na8=U, set y9=6\n\nt=9: y=6, safe (t=9 not 6,7,8)\n\na9=U, set y10=7\n\nt=10: y=7, safe (t=10 not 6)\n\na10=U, set y11=8\n\nt=11: y=8, safe (t=11 not 6)\n\na11=U, set y12=9\n\nt=12: y=12=9, at (0,9)\n\nNow, actions for turns 4 to 11: a4=U, a5=U, a6=S, a7=S, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nAnd for turn 12, since H=9, I need a12, which can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a11, I set y12=9, so at turn 12, I am at y=9.\n\nThen a12 can be anything, say S.\n\nBut to minimize, perhaps I can have only up to a11, but with H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAt turn t=12, y=9, so t1+H-1=12, 4+H-1=12, H=9, so I need 9 actions, including up to turn 12.\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1=8, actions at t1+0=4 to t1+8=12.\n\nt=0 to 8, τ=4 to 12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions: τ=4: U, τ=5: U, τ=6: S, τ=7: S, τ=8: U, τ=9: U, τ=10: U, τ=11: U, τ=12: S\n\nBut at τ=9: action U, set y10=7\n\nτ=10: U, set y11=8\n\nτ=11: U, set y12=9\n\nτ=12: S, set y13=9\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can start with different action.\n\nFor example, at t=4, instead of U, I take S, but then I delay, might be worse.\n\nFor instance, t=4 S, y5=3\n\nt=5 U, y6=4\n\nt=6 U, y7=5\n\nt=7 S, y8=5\n\nt=8 U, y9=6\n\nThen same as before, but I started later, so to reach y=9, I need more actions or same.\n\nt=9 y=6, then t=10 U y11=7? a9=U set y10=7, t=10 y=7, a10=U y11=8, a11=U y12=9, so same T=12.\n\nBut with an extra S at beginning, so H larger or same, but in this case, from t=4 to t=12, same H=9.\n\nBut with different actions.\n\nBut min H is 9, so no better.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo for output.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. The sequence of actions starts from turn 4 and ends at turn 12, ensuring that at turn 12 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 9 - 1 = 12\\)), the player is at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe actions are chosen to avoid unsafe times on each freeway:\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn 6.\n- Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 5.\n- Freeway 3 is always safe.\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns 4 and 8.\n- Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns 16, 17, and 18 (not relevant for minimal path).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 6.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 6.\n\nThe path is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) by turn 6.\n- Stay at \\(y = 5\\) during turns 6 and 7 to avoid being on \\(y = 6\\) during its unsafe turns (6, 7, 8).\n- Move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9 (safe, as turn 9 is not unsafe for \\(y = 6\\)).\n- Move directly up to \\(y = 9\\) from turns 9 to 12, as higher freeways are safe after turn 6.\n\nAction sequence:\n- At turn 4, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) (safe at turn 5).\n- At turn 5, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) (safe).\n- At turn 6, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 5\\) (avoids \\(y = 6\\) at unsafe turn 7).\n- At turn 7, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 5\\) (avoids \\(y = 6\\) at unsafe turn 8).\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) (safe at turn 9).\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) (safe).\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) (safe).\n- At turn 11, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 12, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 9\\) (position reached).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as the player is only on freeways during safe turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 6 and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then stays)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then stays)\n  S: stay\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y) and y is a freeway (so y between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on that freeway y. \n  Collision occurs if the player's x=0 is in the span of any car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T and on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1. \n  So when moving, at the moment of turn T, we are only concerned with the cars on the freeway of the current position (which is y_T).\n\nWe are to output the actions starting from turn t1 (turn 6) until the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nPlan:\n  We need to simulate the movement from y=5 at turn 6 until we get to y=9, avoiding collisions.\n\n  We are given the state of the cars at turn t1=6. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) we have a list of cars. Each car is (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\n  How the cars move:\n    For a car at turn t1=6 with (h, t, d, s):\n      If left-moving (d='left'): then at turn T (T>=6), the car's head becomes h - s*(T-6) and tail becomes t - s*(T-6). \n        Note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        But note: in the example, for freeway 3 we have (48,71,left,24). However, note that the representation of the car: \n          - For a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \n            \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then it moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n          But note: in the representation for freeway 3: (48,71,left,24). This would mean at t1=6, the car spans from 48 to 71? \n          However, that is 24 units long (71-48+1=24) and moving left at speed 24 per turn? Then after one turn, it would be at [48-24=24, 71-24=47]. \n\n        But wait: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the head moves from h to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail from tau to tau - s*(T-t1). \n        So the entire car shifts left by s*(T-t1).\n\n      Similarly, for right-moving: \n        [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> meaning the car shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\n  However, note the representation in the table:\n      For freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> this car is right-moving. So at t1=6, the car is from tau=-11 to h=0? \n        Then at time T, the car will be from -11 + 12*(T-6) to 0 + 12*(T-6).\n\n      But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n        So at T=6: [ -11, 0 ] -> then at T=7: [ -11+12=1, 0+12=12 ]\n\n  So the representation for a car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the order of head and tail:\n      For left-moving: the car is [head, tail] meaning head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Actually, the problem does not specify which is which. \n      But from the update rule, we can deduce:\n        - For left-moving: the car moves left, so the head (which was at h) becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was at tau) becomes tau - s*(T-t1). \n          This implies that the entire segment shifts left. The head is the right endpoint? Because if the car is moving left, the front is going to the left? \n          Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". In a left-moving car, the head would be the leftmost part? But then if it moves left, the head becomes even more negative? \n\n      Let me reinterpret the update:\n\n        Left-moving: the car's span at time t1 is [h, tau]. Then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n          This means that the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1). The head (which was h) becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was tau) becomes tau - s*(T-t1). \n          But note: if h < tau, then the car would be from h to tau? But then moving left would make h even smaller? \n\n      However, in the example for freeway 3: (48,71,left,24) -> at T=6, the car is from 48 to 71? Then moving left: at T=7, it becomes 48-24=24 to 71-24=47. \n          So the car is 24 units long? That makes sense: 71-48+1=24? Actually, the length is (71-48+1)=24? But note: the problem doesn't specify if the endpoints are inclusive. \n\n      Actually, the collision condition: we are checking if 0 is in the span. The span is an interval. We need to know if 0 is between the two endpoints, inclusive.\n\n      So for a left-moving car: the car at time T is the interval [min(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)), max(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1))]? \n        But the update rule doesn't change the order? \n\n      Let's look: at T=6, the car is [48,71] -> then at T=7: [24,47]. This implies that the car was originally from 48 to 71 (so 48 is the leftmost and 71 the rightmost) and then moves to 24 to 47. \n\n      But wait: if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left. So the leftmost point becomes 48-24=24 and the rightmost becomes 71-24=47. \n\n      Therefore, the representation (h, tau) for a left-moving car: \n          h is the leftmost point? and tau is the rightmost? \n          But then at T=6: [h=48, tau=71] -> which is [48,71] meaning the car covers x from 48 to 71.\n\n      However, the update rule says: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n          So if h=48 and tau=71, then after one step: [24,47]. \n\n      Similarly, for a right-moving car: \n          The representation (h, tau) and the update: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n          Example: freeway1: (0, -11, right, 12): \n            At T=6: the car is [tau=-11, h=0] -> so from -11 to 0. \n            Then at T=7: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> so the car moves to [1,12].\n\n      Therefore, we can interpret the representation for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) as:\n        - For a right-moving car: the car spans from tail to head (with tail <= head) at time t1? \n          But in the example: (0, -11, right, 12): head=0, tail=-11 -> then the car is from tail=-11 to head=0? \n        - For a left-moving car: the car spans from head to tail (with head <= tail) at time t1? \n          Example: (48,71,left,24): head=48, tail=71 -> so from 48 to 71.\n\n      But note: the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] and then moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n          So the entire segment moves right. The tail becomes tau + s*(T-t1) and the head becomes h + s*(T-t1). \n          Therefore, the representation: \n            tail = tau (the leftmost endpoint at t1) and head = h (the rightmost endpoint at t1) for a right-moving car.\n\n      Similarly, for left-moving: \n          The update rule uses [h, tau] and moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n          So the entire segment moves left. The head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). \n          Therefore, the representation:\n            head = h (the leftmost endpoint at t1) and tail = tau (the rightmost endpoint at t1) for a left-moving car? \n          But wait: then at t1, the car is from h to tau (so h must be less than or equal to tau). \n\n      However, in the example for freeway3: head=48, tail=71 -> so 48 to 71, and then after moving left: 24 to 47. \n\n      But note: the problem states the car as (head, tail, ...). So for a left-moving car, head is the leftmost and tail is the rightmost? \n      And for a right-moving car, head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost? \n\n      This is consistent because:\n          Right-moving: (head, tail) = (0, -11) -> meaning head (rightmost) is 0, tail (leftmost) is -11.\n          Left-moving: (head, tail) = (48,71) -> meaning head (leftmost) is 48, tail (rightmost) is 71.\n\n      Therefore, to get the span at time T for a car:\n        Let t0 = t1 = 6.\n        If direction is 'right':\n            left_end = tail + s*(T-6)\n            right_end = head + s*(T-6)\n        If direction is 'left':\n            left_end = head - s*(T-6)\n            right_end = tail - s*(T-6)\n\n      Then the car covers the interval [left_end, right_end] (inclusive).\n\n  Collision: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y) and y is between 1 and 8, then we require that for the freeway k=y, \n        there is no car such that 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (i.e., left_end <= 0 <= right_end).\n\n  Important: the player is on freeway y at turn T only if at turn T the y-coordinate is y. And note that at turn T, the player moves to y_T at the beginning of the turn? \n      Actually, the update: \n          At turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T that will update the position to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n          But during turn T, we are at y_T. So we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n  Also note: the goal is to be at (0,9). Since 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), we don't check for collision when at 9.\n\n  The player starts at turn 6 at y=5. We want to get to y=9.\n\n  We are to minimize the number of turns H (which is the number of actions, starting at turn6 and then turn7, ... until the turn when we are at 9).\n\n  The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical movement: we are at 5, we need to go to 9 -> 4 steps upward. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\n  We are going to simulate the movement from turn 6 onward. We have to check for each turn T (starting at T=6) the position we are at (y_T) and then choose an action that leads to y_{T+1} in {y_T-1, y_T, y_T+1} without causing a collision at turn T (if we are on a freeway) and without causing a collision at future turns? Actually, we have to plan the entire sequence.\n\n  Since we want the minimal H, we are looking for a shortest path in the state space: state = (turn, y). However, note that the cars move deterministically and the grid is small (y in [0,9]), and the time might be bounded (because the cars move and eventually might leave the x=0 area). \n\n  We can do a BFS in terms of turns. The state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 6) and y in [0,9]. The goal state: y=9. \n\n  The actions: U, D, S.\n\n  Constraints:\n    - If we are at (t, y) and y is between 1 and 8, then we must check that at turn t, the freeway y does not have a car that covers x=0. \n    - We can only move to y+1 if y<9, to y-1 if y>0, and stay at y.\n\n  However, note that the car positions depend on the turn t. We are starting at turn 6. At turn t, the car on freeway k is computed by:\n      For each car on freeway k: \n          if direction is 'right': \n             left_end = tail + speed*(t-6)\n             right_end = head + speed*(t-6)\n          if direction is 'left':\n             left_end = head - speed*(t-6)\n             right_end = tail - speed*(t-6)\n\n      Then we check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] for any car on freeway k.\n\n  Steps:\n    We simulate from state (t, y) to (t+1, y') by applying an action. \n    The cost is 1 per step, and we want to minimize the number of steps.\n\n    We start at (6,5). Goal: any state (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\n    We do BFS (or Dijkstra, but all step costs are 1) over the state (t, y). However, note that t can go arbitrarily high? But we can bound it: \n        We need at least 4 moves (if we go up without waiting) so by turn 10 we can be at 9? But we might have to wait. However, the car patterns are periodic? \n        Actually, the cars move at constant speeds and the freeways are independent. We can compute the car positions at any future turn.\n\n    But note: the car positions are linear in time. The x-coordinates of the cars will eventually leave the 0 point? But we must check.\n\n    However, we can simulate until we have found a path. Since the grid is small (only 10 y-values) and the time we are interested in is at most 6 + (some bounded steps, say 100) we can set a bound.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note that the minimal number of steps is at least 4 (if we go up 4 times) and at worst we might have to wait a few turns. So we can set a bound of, say, 20 turns.\n\n  We'll do BFS until we reach y=9.\n\n  Steps for BFS:\n\n    Let Q be a queue: (t, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions from turn6 to turn t-1? Actually, we are at turn t and we have taken actions for turns 6 to t-1. \n\n    We start at (6,5, []).\n\n    Then for each state (t, y, path), we consider the next action a in {U, D, S}:\n\n        next_y = \n            if a = U: min(9, y+1)\n            if a = D: max(0, y-1)\n            if a = S: y\n\n        But note: we must check the current state (at turn t) for collision: \n            if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check freeway y at turn t: \n                Compute for every car on freeway y: the interval at turn t and see if 0 is in that interval.\n\n            If there is a collision at (t, y), then we cannot be in that state -> so we skip.\n\n        Then we move to (t+1, next_y) and the new path is path + [a].\n\n        However, note: at the next state (t+1, next_y), we will check for collision at turn t+1? But the current state (t,y) must be collision-free.\n\n        Also note: when we are at (t,y) and we take an action, we are at (t,y) during the entire turn t? Then at the end of the turn we update to next_y.\n\n        The collision check at (t,y) is done at the beginning of the turn? The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\n        So we must check the state (t,y) for collision.\n\n    We stop when we have a state (t,9) and we output the path.\n\n    But note: we must not output the action that moves beyond 9? Actually, if we are at 8 and we do U, we go to 9. Then we are done at the next state? \n\n        Actually, the state (t,9) is the goal. We don't need to do an action after that. \n\n        Our sequence of actions: from turn6 to turn (t-1) to get to (t,9). \n\n        How many actions? The number of actions is t - 6.\n\n        We start at turn6: we are at (6,5). Then we take an action at turn6 to go to turn7 with y6 updated to y7. \n        So at turn6: we take action a6 -> then at turn7 we are at (0, y7).\n\n        Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have taken T-6 actions: from turn6 to turn T-1.\n\n        And at turn T, we are at 9. But note: we do not take an action at turn T if we have already reached 9? \n\n        The problem: we are to output the actions until the turn when we first reach y=9. But note the goal: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n          We start at t1=6. We take actions at turns: 6, 7, ..., 6+H-1. Then at turn 6+H, we are at y=9? \n\n          Actually, the update: \n            At turn t1: we are at (0,5). \n            Then we take action at turn t1 (6): that updates to y_{t1+1} at turn 7.\n            We take H actions: at turns 6,7,...,6+H-1 -> then at turn 6+H, we are at y=9.\n\n          So we require: y_{6+H}=9.\n\n          Therefore, the state we are looking for is (t=6+H, 9). And we took H actions.\n\n        In our BFS: \n          We start at (6,5) with 0 actions -> then we take an action to get to (7,y1) with 1 action, then (8,y2) with 2 actions, ... until we get to (6+H,9).\n\n        So when we generate a next state: (t+1, next_y) from (t,y) by taking an action at turn t, then if next_y==9, we have found a solution.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n    We'll do BFS:\n\n      Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of actions to be at (t,y) (or we can use a visited set by (t,y) since t increases and we don't cycle in time?).\n\n      We start: t0=6, y0=5 -> dist[6][5]=0.\n\n      Queue: [ (t, y) ]\n\n      For each state (t,y), if y==9, then we output the path (we need to store the path).\n\n      Else, for each action a in {U, D, S}:\n\n          next_y = \n             a=U: min(9, y+1)\n             a=D: max(0, y-1)\n             a=S: y\n\n          But note: we must check the current state (t,y) for collision: \n            if 1<=y<=8: \n                for each car on freeway y (from the given list for freeway y):\n                    compute the car's interval at turn t:\n\n                    For a car (head, tail, direction, speed) on freeway y:\n                        if direction == 'right':\n                            left_end = tail + speed*(t-6)\n                            right_end = head + speed*(t-6)\n                        else: # left\n                            left_end = head - speed*(t-6)\n                            right_end = tail - speed*(t-6)\n\n                    Then if left_end <= 0 <= right_end -> collision.\n\n                If any car causes collision, then we skip this state? Actually, we are already in the state (t,y) and if there is a collision we should not have come here. \n\n          But wait: we are generating the next state from the current state. The current state (t,y) must be collision-free. So we check:\n\n            if 1<=y<=8 and there is a car on freeway y that covers 0 at turn t, then we cannot use this state at all? \n\n          However, we are at the state (t,y) and we are going to take an action. But if we are already in a collision at (t,y), then we cannot be there.\n\n          Therefore, when we generate a state (t,y) we must check it for collision? \n\n          Actually, we check when we are about to leave the state (t,y) to the next state? \n\n          We can do: \n            When we pop a state (t,y) from the queue, we first check if it is collision-free? \n                If not, we skip.\n            Then if it is goal (y==9), we output.\n\n            Else, we consider the next actions: which lead to (t+1, next_y). But note: the next state (t+1, next_y) will be checked for collision when we pop it? \n\n          However, we must also note: the state (t,y) must be checked for collision at the time we are in it. \n\n          So we do:\n\n            for each state (t,y) that we pop:\n                if y is between 1 and 8:\n                    if there is a car on freeway y that covers 0 at turn t -> then this state is invalid, skip.\n                if y==9: we are done.\n\n                Then for each action, we compute next_y and then the next state (t+1, next_y). We push that state if we haven't visited it (with same or fewer steps).\n\n          But note: we might visit (t,y) multiple times? But t is increasing and y is discrete. We can use a visited set for (t,y). However, we might have multiple paths to (t,y). But we are doing BFS by time? \n\n          Actually, we are doing BFS in time steps. Since we move one turn at a time, we can use:\n\n            visited[t][y] = whether we have been at (t,y) with a path of length (t-6) actions.\n\n          We want the minimal H, so we want the first time we get to (t,9). \n\n  We'll do:\n\n      Let's create a 2D array (or dictionary) for visited: visited[t][y] = true if we have visited state (t,y). We start t from 6 up to a bound (say 6+20).\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Let Q be a queue of (t, y, path)\n        Start: (6,5, [])\n\n        while Q not empty:\n            pop state (t, y, path)\n\n            if y==9: \n                then we output the path -> which has length H = (t-6) actions? \n                But note: we are at (t,9) and we got there by taking the actions in the path? \n                    The path is the actions taken at turns 6,7,...,t-1 -> so H = t-6.\n\n                And we are done.\n\n            Check collision at (t,y):\n                if 1<=y<=8: \n                    cars = the list for freeway y (from the given table)\n                    collision = false\n                    for each car in cars:\n                        (head, tail, d, s) = car\n                        if d == 'right':\n                            left_end = tail + s*(t-6)\n                            right_end = head + s*(t-6)\n                        else: # d == 'left'\n                            left_end = head - s*(t-6)\n                            right_end = tail - s*(t-6)\n\n                        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                            collision = true; break\n\n                    if collision: skip this state.\n\n                If y==0 or y==9: no collision (but note we are at y, and if y==0 or 9, we are not on a freeway).\n\n            Then, if we passed the collision check, then we consider the next actions.\n\n            But note: if we are at (t,y) and we are going to take an action at turn t, then we generate the next state (t+1, next_y).\n\n            For each action a in ['U','D','S']:\n\n                next_y = \n                    a=='U': min(9, y+1)\n                    a=='D': max(0, y-1)\n                    a=='S': y\n\n                if we haven't visited (t+1, next_y) and t+1 <= some bound (say 20 turns: t+1<=26), then push (t+1, next_y, path + [a])\n\n        If we don't find a solution within the bound, we might need to extend.\n\n  Given the car speeds and positions, we can compute the intervals at any turn.\n\n  We'll set a bound: let max_turn = 6+20 = 26.\n\n  Now, let's code the BFS.\n\n  But note: the car data:\n\n    We are given for freeways 1 to 8. We'll store:\n\n        cars[1] = [ (0, -11, 'right', 12), (-48, -59, 'right', 12) ]\n        cars[2] = [ (48, 1, 'right', 48) ]   # wait: the representation in the table for freeway2: (48, 1, right, 48) -> \n                But note: the representation is (head, tail, ...). For a right-moving car, head is the rightmost? \n                So head=48, tail=1? Then the car at t1=6: [1,48]? \n                Then at turn t: \n                    left_end = 1 + 48*(t-6)\n                    right_end = 48 + 48*(t-6)\n\n        However, wait: the table says for freeway2: (48, 1, right, 48) -> but note the order: the table says \"head, tail\", but in the representation we deduced: \n            For right-moving: head is the right endpoint, tail is the left endpoint? \n            But here: head=48, tail=1 -> so the car is from 1 to 48? \n\n        But then the update: at t1=6: [1,48].

Then we can go U to 8 at turn12.\n\n          Check freeway8 at turn12: \n              cars[8]: same as freeway1: \n                 car1: [-11+12*6=61, 0+72=72] -> safe.\n                 car2: [-59+72=13, -48+72=24] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn12: at 8. Then U to 9 at turn13.\n\n          Then we are at 9 at turn13 -> done.\n\n          Actions: \n            turn6: S\n            turn7: S\n            turn8: S -> but wait: we did:\n                turn6: S -> then at turn7: at 5 -> then turn7: S -> turn8: at 5 -> then turn8: U -> to 6 at turn9 -> then turn9: S -> turn10: at 6 -> then turn10: U -> turn11: at 7 -> turn11: U -> turn12: at 8 -> turn12: U -> turn13: at 9.\n\n          So actions: \n            turn6: S\n            turn7: S\n            turn8: U\n            turn9: S\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U\n\n          Total 7 actions.\n\n          Is there a shorter path?\n\n          We must go from 5 to 9: 4 steps up. So minimal is 4. But we had to wait 3 times? So 7 actions.\n\n          Let me check if we can do 6 actions: \n\n          We need to be at 9 at turn 12? (since 6+6=12). Then we must have taken 6 actions.\n\n          How? \n\n          We start at 5 at turn6.\n\n          We have to avoid collisions at freeway6 (at turns when we are at 6) and freeway7 (at turns when we are at 7) and freeway8 (at turns when we are at 8).\n\n          We must be at 6 at some turn t1: then we require that at turn t1, freeway6 is safe.\n\n          Similarly for 7 and 8.\n\n          The problematic freeways:\n            freeway6: \n                car3: at time t: [-11+4*(t-6), 0+4*(t-6)]\n                We need 0 not in [ -11+4*(t-6), 4*(t-6) ].\n\n                Solve: \n                    Case 1: 4*(t-6) < -11+4*(t-6) -> impossible? \n                    Actually, the interval is [a, b] with a=-11+4*(t-6), b=4*(t-6). \n                    We require that 0 < a or 0 > b? \n                    But note: a = b - 11 -> so a < b. \n                    Then we require either 0 < a or 0 > b.\n\n                    So: \n                      Option1: 0 < a -> 0 < -11+4*(t-6) -> 11 < 4*(t-6) -> t-6>2.75 -> t>=10 (since t integer)\n                      Option2: 0 > b -> 0>4*(t-6) -> t<6 -> not possible.\n\n                    So freeway6 is safe only at turns t>=10.\n\n            freeway7: \n                car2: at time t: [-59+12*(t-6), -48+12*(t-6)] -> we need 0 not in [a, b] where a=-59+12*(t-6), b=-48+12*(t-6)\n                This interval: a = b - 11 -> so same as above? \n                We require 0 < a or 0 > b.\n                Option1: 0 < a -> 0 < -59+12*(t-6) -> 59<12*(t-6) -> t-6>=5 -> t>=11 (since 59/12≈4.91)\n                Option2: 0 > b -> 0> -48+12*(t-6) -> 48>12*(t-6) -> t-6<4 -> t<10.\n\n            freeway8: same as freeway7: safe for t<10 or t>=11? Actually, same as freeway7.\n\n          So to be at freeway6: we must be at time>=10.\n          To be at freeway7: we must be at time<10 or time>=11? \n          To be at freeway8: same.\n\n          But note: we must pass through 6,7,8 in consecutive turns? Not necessarily: we can wait.\n\n          However, we are moving one step per turn? \n\n          We start at 5. Then we go to 6 at time t1, then to 7 at time t1+1, then to 8 at time t1+2, then to 9 at time t1+3.\n\n          So if we are at 6 at time t (with t>=10), then at time t+1 we are at 7 -> but t+1>=11 -> which is safe for freeway7? (because for freeway7: t+1>=11 -> safe by option1: a>0? \n             at t+1: for freeway7, car2: a = -59+12*((t+1)-6) = -59+12*(t-5) = -59+12*t-60 = 12*t-119\n             we need 0 < a -> 0 < 12*t-119 -> t>119/12≈9.9 -> so t>=10 -> then t+1>=11 -> then 12*11-119=132-119=13>0 -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway8 at time t+2: \n             car2: a = -59+12*(t+2-6)= -59+12*(t-4)=12*t-48-59=12*t-107\n             at t>=10: a>=12*10-107=120-107=13>0 -> safe.\n\n          So if we are at 6 at time t (t>=10), then 7 at t+1 (>=11) and 8 at t+2 (>=12) are safe.\n\n          Then we can go:\n\n            turn6: at 5.\n            We need to get to 6 at time>=10.\n\n            How? \n              We can wait at 5 until time 9? \n                At time 6: safe (as before).\n                At time 7: safe? freeway5: \n                    car: [-51+4*(t-6)] -> at t=7: [-51+4=-47, -40+4=-36] -> safe.\n                At time 8: [-51+8=-43, -40+8=-32] -> safe.\n                At time 9: [-51+12=-39, -40+12=-28] -> safe.\n\n            Then at time9: we are at 5. Then we do U at time9: to 6 at time10 -> which is safe for freeway6 (as we require t>=10).\n\n            Then we do:\n                time10: at 6 -> then U to 7 at time11 -> safe for freeway7 (as above).\n                time11: at 7 -> U to 8 at time12 -> safe for freeway8.\n                time12: at 8 -> U to 9 at time13.\n\n            Then we are at 9 at time13.\n\n            Actions: \n                turn6: S (or wait at 5) -> but we can also move down? but we don't want to. Actually, we can stay at 5 until time9.\n                turn6: S\n                turn7: S\n                turn8: S\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: U\n                turn12: U\n\n            That's 7 actions.\n\n          But wait: we are at 5 at time6, then we do S at turn6: stay at 5 at time7.\n          Then S at turn7: time8: at5.\n          Then S at turn8: time9: at5.\n          Then U at turn9: time10: at6 -> safe.\n          Then U at turn10: time11: at7 -> safe.\n          Then U at turn11: time12: at8 -> safe.\n          Then U at turn12: time13: at9.\n\n          So 7 actions.\n\n          Can we do 6 actions? Then we would be at 9 at time12 (6+6=12). \n\n          We must be at 9 at time12. Then we must have been at 8 at time11, at 7 at time10, at 6 at time9.\n\n          But at time9: at6 -> we require freeway6 safe at time9? \n             freeway6: car3: at time9: [-11+4*(9-6)= -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n                But wait: we thought freeway6 safe only for t>=10? \n                But at t=9: \n                    car3: [-11+4*3 = -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Then why did we think freeway6 required t>=10? \n              We had: 0 < a -> a=-11+4*(t-6) -> we required -11+4*(t-6)>0 -> 4*(t-6)>11 -> t-6>11/4=2.75 -> t>=10? \n              But at t=9: t-6=3 -> -11+12=1>0 -> safe. \n              Actually, we did the math: \n                  We require 0 not in [a,b] = [ -11+4*(t-6), 4*(t-6) ]\n                  At t=9: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n          So freeway6 is safe for t>=9? \n\n          Similarly, freeway7 at time10: \n              car2: [-59+12*(10-6)= -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> collision.\n\n          So at time10: if we are at 7, we collide.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at 7 at time10.\n\n          But we are at 7 at time10: because we were at 6 at time9 and then we did U at time9 to go to 7 at time10.\n\n          So we must avoid being at 7 at time10.\n\n          How about if we are at 6 at time9 and then we wait at 6 at time10? \n             freeway6 at time10: \n                 car3: [-11+4*4=5, 0+16=16] -> [5,16] -> safe.\n             Then at time10: we are at 6. Then at time10: we do U to 7 at time11.\n\n          Then freeway7 at time11: \n              car2: [-59+12*5=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Then we do U at time11 to 8 at time12 -> freeway8 at time12: safe? \n              car2: [-59+12*6=13, -48+72=24] -> safe.\n\n          Then U at time12 to 9 at time13.\n\n          So we have:\n            time6:5 -> S (stay at 5 at time7)\n            time7:5 -> S (stay at 5 at time8)\n            time8:5 -> U (to6 at time9) -> safe.\n            time9:6 -> S (stay at6 at time10) -> safe.\n            time10:6 -> U (to7 at time11) -> safe.\n            time11:7 -> U (to8 at time12) -> safe.\n            time12:8 -> U (to9 at time13)\n\n          Still 7 actions.\n\n          How to get 6 actions? We must get to 9 at time12.\n\n          We need to be at 8 at time11, then at time12: U to9.\n\n          How to be at 8 at time11? Then we must be at 7 at time10, and at 6 at time9.\n\n          But at time10: at7 -> freeway7: car2: [-59+12*4=-11, -48+48=0] -> collision.\n\n          So we cannot be at 7 at time10.\n\n          Alternatively, we might try to go down? \n\n          But we start at 5. We want to go up. Going down might delay.\n\n          Or we might skip freeway6 at time9 and time10 by going from 5 to 6 at a later time? But we already tried the minimal waiting.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\n  But wait: what about going down to avoid freeway7 at time10? \n\n      Example: \n        turn6: D -> to4 at time7.\n        Then we go up: but that would take more steps.\n\n  So the minimal is 7.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence: \n        turn6: S\n        turn7: S\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: S\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n        turn12: U\n\n  But wait: in the BFS we had an alternative: \n        We had at time8: (8,5,['D','U']) -> that was from (7,4) which we pushed from (6,5) by going down? \n        But we skipped (8,5) because we didn't expand it? Actually, we did: we popped (8,5,['D','U']) and it was safe? \n            At time8: freeway5: safe -> then we pushed:\n                U: to6 at time9 -> (9,6,['D','U','U']) -> then we check at time9: freeway6: car3: [1,12] -> safe? \n                Then we can continue from there? \n\n        Then we have:\n            time6:5 -> D to4 at time7: \n                at time7: freeway4: safe? \n                    cars[4]: \n                       car1: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> safe.\n                       car2: [49+12=61,60+12=72] -> safe.\n                       car3: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n            time7:4 -> U to5 at time8: \n                at time8: freeway5: \n                    car: [-51+8=-43, -40+8=-32] -> safe.\n            time8:5 -> U to6 at time9: \n                at time9: freeway6: car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            Then at time9: we are at6. Then we do:\n                time9: U to7 at time10: \n                    freeway7 at time10: \n                         car2: [-59+12*4=-11, -48+48=0] -> collision -> not safe.\n\n            So we have to wait at6 at time9? Then at time9: S -> then time10: at6 -> safe (freeway6 at time10: [5,16] -> safe).\n            Then time10: U to7 at time11: safe (freeway7: [1,12] at time11: safe? \n                  car2: [-59+12*5=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n            Then time11: U to8 at time12: safe (freeway8: same as freeway7 at time12: [13,24] -> safe).\n            Then time12: U to9 at time13.\n\n            Total actions: \n                turn6: D\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: S\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: U\n                turn12: U -> 7 actions.\n\n        This is also 7 actions.\n\n        But we have a sequence that goes down then up: that might be the same length.\n\n        However, we found a sequence that doesn't go down and uses 7 actions.\n\n  Therefore, we choose the sequence that stays at 5 for two turns then moves up.\n\n  But note: the problem asks for minimal H (number of turns) and we have two sequences with H=7. \n\n  We can output either? \n\n  However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have 7. \n\n  We'll output the one that doesn't go down? \n\n  So:\n\n      Turn 6: S\n      Turn 7: S\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: S\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n\n  But wait: at turn9 we are at6? and then we do S at turn9 to stay at6 at time10? \n        Then at turn10 we do U to go to7 at time11.\n\n  However, we can avoid that extra wait? \n\n      We found that at time9: freeway6 is safe -> so we can do U at turn9 to go to7 at time10? \n        But at time10: freeway7 is not safe (collision). \n\n      So we have to wait at6 at time9? \n\n  Therefore, the sequence above.\n\n  But let me write the states:\n\n      t=6: y=5 -> safe? yes.\n        action: S -> then t=7: y=5\n      t=7: y=5 -> safe? yes.\n        action: S -> then t=8: y=5\n      t=8: y=5 -> safe? yes.\n        action: U -> then t=9: y=6\n      t=9: y=6 -> safe? yes (freeway6: [1,12] -> no 0) -> \n        But we want to avoid being at7 at time10? So we cannot do U now? \n        We do S: then t=10: y=6\n      t=10: y=6 -> safe? freeway6: [5,16] -> safe.\n        action: U -> t=11: y=7\n      t=11: y=7 -> safe? freeway7: car2: [1,12] -> safe? \n        action: U -> t=12: y=8\n      t=12: y=8 -> safe? freeway8: same as freeway7 at time12: \n            car1: [-11+12*6=61,0+72=72] -> safe.\n            car2: [-59+72=13,-48+72=24] -> safe.\n        action: U -> t=13: y=9 -> goal.\n\n  So the actions are for turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 -> 7 actions.\n\n  Therefore, the answer:\n\n      Turn 6: S\n      Turn 7: S\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: S\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n\n  But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> \n        H=7, so t from 0 to 6.\n\n        t=0: a_{t1+0} = a6 -> S\n        t=1: a7 -> S\n        t=2: a8 -> U\n        t=3: a9 -> S\n        t=4: a10 -> U\n        t=5: a11 -> U\n        t=6: a12 -> U\n\n  So we write:\n\n      Turn 6: S\n      Turn 7: S\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: S\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n\n  Now, we must verify the collisions at each step:\n\n    Turn6: at (6,5): safe -> done.\n    Then we do S -> so at turn7: we are at (7,5): \n        freeway5: car: [-51+4*(7-6)= -47, -40+4=-36] -> safe.\n\n    Turn7: S -> turn8: (8,5): \n        freeway5: [-51+8=-43, -40+8=-32] -> safe.\n\n    Turn8: U -> turn9: (9,6): \n        freeway6: \n            car1: [-51+4*3=-39, -40+12=-28] -> safe.\n            car2: [25+12=37,36+12=48] -> safe.\n            car3: [-11+12=1,0+12=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n    Turn9: S -> turn10: (10,6): \n        freeway6: \n            car1: [-51+4*4=-35, -40+16=-24] -> safe.\n            car2: [25+16=41,36+16=52] -> safe.\n            car3: [-11+16=5,0+16=16] -> 0 not in [5,16] -> safe.\n\n    Turn10: U -> turn11: (11,7): \n        freeway7: \n            car1: [-11+12*(11-6)= -11+60=49, 0+60=60] -> safe.\n            car2: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n    Turn11: U -> turn12: (12,8): \n        freeway8: \n            car1: [-11+12*(12-6)= -11+72=61, 0+72=72] -> safe.\n            car2: [-59+72=13, -48+72=24] -> safe.\n\n    Turn12: U -> turn13: (13,9) -> goal.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      Turn 6: S\n      Turn 7: S\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: S\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" -> H=7.\n\n  However, is there a path with H=6? \n\n      We start at turn6:5.\n      We need to be at9 at turn12 (since 6+6=12) -> then we must have taken 6 actions.\n\n      We must be at8 at turn11, at7 at turn10, at6 at turn9, at5 at turn8? or we could jump? \n\n      We must pass through 6,7,8. \n\n      We are at5 at turn6. Then:\n        turn6: action a6 -> turn7: y7\n        turn7: action a7 -> turn8: y8\n        turn8: action a8 -> turn9: y9\n        turn9: action a9 -> turn10: y10\n        turn10: action a10 -> turn11: y11\n        turn11: action a11 -> turn12: y12=9.\n\n      Therefore, we must have been at6 at some turn t in [7,8,9,10,11]? But we must be at6,7,8 in consecutive turns? \n\n      Actually, we can be at6 at turn7, then at7 at turn8, then at8 at turn9, then at9 at turn10? but that would take 4 actions: then we can wait the rest? \n\n      However, we want to be at9 at turn12, so we can be at9 at turn10 and then wait? \n\n      But note: once we are at9, we are done. So we don't need to wait. We can be at9 at turn10? \n\n      How? \n        turn6: U -> to6 at turn7.\n        turn7: U -> to7 at turn8.\n        turn8: U -> to8 at turn9.\n        turn9: U -> to9 at turn10.\n\n      Then we are done at turn10? \n          Then we have taken 4 actions: H=4? \n\n      But we are at9 at turn10 -> which is 6+4=10. \n\n      Then we don't take any more actions? \n\n      However, the problem: we take actions until we reach (0,9). The goal is to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n          We start at t1=6. \n          After 0 actions: we are at turn6: y6=5.\n          After 1 action: turn7: y7=6.\n          After 2 actions: turn8: y8=7.\n          After 3 actions: turn9: y9=8.\n          After 4 actions: turn10: y10=9.\n\n          So H=4? \n\n      But we must check for collisions:\n\n          turn6: at5 -> safe.\n          turn6: U -> then at turn7: we are at6 -> must check freeway6 at turn7: \n                car3: [-11+4*(7-6)= -7, 0+4=4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> collision.\n\n      So we cannot do U at turn6.\n\n      We must wait until turn9 to go to6? \n\n      Then we can do:\n\n          turn6: S -> turn7:5\n          turn7: S -> turn8:5\n          turn8: U -> turn9:6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: [1,12] -> safe)\n          turn9: U -> turn10:7 -> freeway7 at turn10: \n                car2: [-59+12*4=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n      So we cannot do U at turn9 to go to7 at turn10.\n\n      Then we must wait at6 at turn9? \n\n          turn9: S -> turn10:6 -> safe.\n          turn10: U -> turn11:7 -> freeway7 at turn11: [1,12] -> safe.\n          turn11: U -> turn12:8 -> freeway8 at turn12: [13,24] -> safe.\n          turn12: U -> turn13:9 -> done.\n\n      This is 7 actions.\n\n      Therefore, minimal H is 7.\n\n  Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 6, staying at \\(y = 5\\) (action S) is safe because freeway 5 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 7, staying at \\(y = 5\\) (action S) remains safe for the same reason.\n- At turn 8, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) (action U) is safe because the cars on freeway 6 at turn 8 do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 9, staying at \\(y = 6\\) (action S) is safe as the cars on freeway 6 at turn 9 do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 10, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) (action U) is safe because the cars on freeway 7 at turn 10 do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 11, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) (action U) is safe because the cars on freeway 8 at turn 11 do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 12, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) (action U) reaches the goal, and no collision check is needed for \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 13 (i.e., after 7 actions starting from turn 6), which is minimal given the collision constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8) at the moment when the player is on that freeway.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn T, the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and for any car on that freeway k, the car's span at turn T contains 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T they are still on y (so they are vulnerable to cars on freeway y at turn T). At turn T+1, they are on y' and vulnerable to cars on freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1) from the initial state at t1.\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\nGiven initial car states at turn t1=7.\n\nWe must compute the car spans for any future turn T (>=7) for each freeway.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=5 at turn 7 to y=9 at some turn T (>=7) without colliding.\n\nThe player's y-coordinate is updated as:\n  U: y+1 (unless already at 9, then stays? but note: y in [0,9] so if at 9, U would be invalid? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. However, we start at 5 and need to get to 9, so we can only go up to 9. Also, if we try to go above 9, it should be clipped? The problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", so we assume that if we are at 9 and try U, we stay at 9? Similarly for D at 0. But note: we are at 5 and want to go to 9, so we will only use U and S mostly, but sometimes D might be used to avoid? However, going down from 5 might not be efficient. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nWe have to output the actions starting from turn t1=7 until the turn when we first reach 9. Note: at the turn when we are at 9, we have achieved the goal. So the last action that gets us to 9 is the last one we need to output.\n\nWe are to output:\n\nTurn 7: a_7\nTurn 8: a_8\n...\nTurn 7+H-1: a_{7+H-1}\n\nsuch that at turn 7+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 7 to 7+H-1 (except note: when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? because cars are only on freeways y=1..8). So at turn T, if the player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision can occur. But note: we start at (0,5) and we are at freeway 5 at turn 7. We must check the cars on freeway 5 at turn 7? Actually, at turn 7 we are at freeway 5, so we must check if there is a car on freeway 5 at turn 7 that covers x=0? If so, we start in collision? But the problem states the current state, so we assume we are not in collision at the start? Let's see the car state for freeway 5:\n\nFreeway 5: (-36, -47, right, 4) -> at turn 7, the car is moving right. The span is [tau, h] for right-moving? But the table says: for right-moving, the initial span at t1 is [tau, h]. But the table entry for freeway 5 is: (-36, -47, right, 4). So tau = -47, h = -36? Then the initial span at turn7 is [ -47, -36 ]. This does not include 0. So we are safe at turn7.\n\nSimilarly, we must compute for every future turn and every freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nHow to approach:\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) and record the minimal turns to reach (turn, y) and the path. But note: the state also depends on the car positions which are deterministic and depend on the turn number. Since the car movements are linear with time, we can compute the car span at any turn T for any freeway.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we are on at each turn. And we are only concerned with whether at turn T, on freeway k, there is a car that has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe note that the player's moves are only vertical. The horizontal position is fixed at 0.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at a given turn T (>=7). Then for a given turn T and freeway k, we can check if there is any car on freeway k at turn T that has a span containing 0.\n\n2. We are going to simulate from turn 7 onward. The state is (t, y). We start at (7,5). The goal is (t,9) for any t>=7.\n\n3. From a state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then:\n   - If a is U, then next y' = min(9, y+1)\n   - If a is D, then next y' = max(0, y-1)\n   - If a is S, then next y' = y\n\n   Then the next state is (t+1, y').\n\n   But note: at the current state (t,y), we must check if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and if at turn t, on freeway y, there is a car that covers 0? If yes, then this state is invalid.\n\n   However, note that we start at turn 7, y=5 and we already know it's safe. Then we simulate the next turn.\n\n   Important: when we are at state (t,y), we are about to take an action at turn t. But we are already at (0,y) at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the collision check at turn t must be done at the beginning of the turn? The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And note that the player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). So at state (t,y), we are at (0,y) at the beginning of turn t, and then we choose an action to move to the next state.\n\n   Therefore, at the beginning of turn t, if y is between 1 and 8, we must check the cars on freeway y at turn t. If there is a car that has a span containing 0 at turn t, then we are in collision at the start of the turn and this state is invalid.\n\n   Then we choose an action and move to the next state (t+1, y').\n\n   Also, note that when we move, at the next turn t+1, we are at y', and then we check collision at turn t+1 for freeway y' (if y' in [1,8]).\n\n4. We must avoid states that we have visited with the same (t,y) but with a different path? But we are doing BFS and we are minimizing the number of turns, so we want the minimal H. We can use a visited set for (t,y) and if we have visited (t,y) with a lower or equal number of turns, we skip. However, note that the same (t,y) might be reached by different paths and we want the minimal turns. Since we are doing BFS by time (t increases by 1 each step), the first time we reach y=9 we have the minimal H.\n\n   Actually, the state is (t,y). We start at (7,5). We want to get to (t,9) for the smallest t. We can do BFS in increasing t.\n\n   We maintain:\n      queue: (t, y, path)  where path is the sequence of actions from turn7 to turn t-1? Or we can record the parent pointers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can record for each (t,y) the minimal number of steps and the action that led to it. But note: the same (t,y) might be reached by different paths, but if we have visited (t,y) already, then we don't need to revisit because the future from (t,y) is independent of the path.\n\n   However, note: the car positions are deterministic and depend only on t. So the safety of (t,y) is fixed. Therefore, we can mark (t,y) as visited and if we come to (t,y) again with a longer path, we skip.\n\n   So we do:\n\n      Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of steps from the start (or the turn t) to reach (t,y). Actually, we are only interested in the minimal t when we reach (t,9). We can break when we reach (t,9) for the first time.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Initialize: \n          dist[7][5] = 0, and we set visited for (7,5) as safe? But we must check (7,5): freeway 5 at turn7. We have freeway5: car (-36,-47,right,4). At turn7: the car is at [ -47 + 4*(7-7), -36 + 4*(7-7) ]? Actually, the update rule:\n\n          Right-moving: initial span at t1=7 is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? But wait, the table says: for freeway5: (-36, -47, right, 4). How to interpret? The table says: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n          For right-moving: the head is at the front (rightmost) and tail at the back (leftmost). So the initial span at t1=7 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But the table says: (head, tail) = (-36, -47). So head=-36, tail=-47? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] for a right-moving car? \n\n          However, the update rule for right-moving: \n              Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\n          So at T=7: [ -47 + 4*0, -36 + 4*0] = [-47, -36]. This does not contain 0. So safe.\n\n      Then we consider actions at turn7: U, D, S.\n\n      For each action, we compute the next state (t+1, y').\n\n      Then we check the state (t+1, y'): \n          - if y' is in [1,8], we check the cars on freeway y' at turn T = t+1.\n\n      How to compute the car spans for freeway k at turn T?\n\n          For each car on freeway k: \n              If the car is right-moving: \n                  tail_T = tail_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n                  head_T = head_{t1} + s*(T - t1)\n                  The span is [tail_T, head_T] (which is [tail, head] because it's moving right and tail is the left end? Actually, note: the problem says for right-moving: initial span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning [tail, head] and then it shifts by adding s*(T-t1) to both. So the span is an interval that moves to the right.\n\n          But note: the problem says for right-moving: \n              initial: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n          Similarly, left-moving: \n              initial: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n          However, note the table entry for left-moving: for example, freeway3: (24,47,left,24). \n              The initial span at t1=7: for left-moving, the table says (head, tail) = (24,47). But the update rule for left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau]? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". So at t1=7: [24,47]. Then at turn T: [24 - 24*(T-7), 47 - 24*(T-7)].\n\n      Now, we need to check if 0 is in the interval. \n\n      Important: the interval for a car is continuous. So for a car on freeway k at turn T, if 0 is between the left end and the right end (inclusive), then collision.\n\n      Also note: there might be multiple cars on the same freeway. If any one of them covers 0, then collision.\n\n5. We simulate until we reach y=9. We break when we first reach (t,9) and then output the actions from turn7 to turn t-1? Actually, note:\n\n      We start at turn7: state (7,5). Then we take an action at turn7 to go to state (8, y').\n\n      We want to output the action at turn7, then turn8, ... until the turn when we are at y=9. But note: when we reach (t,9), we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t. But we don't need to take an action at turn t if we are already at 9? Actually, we must have taken an action at turn t-1 to get to 9 at turn t. So the last action we take is at turn t-1 that leads to 9 at turn t.\n\n      Therefore, we will have H = t - 6? Actually, from turn7 to turn t (exclusive at the start of turn7, and we take actions at turns 7,8,...,t-1). So the number of actions is (t - 7). And H = t - 7? But the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if we start at t1=7, then the actions are a_7, a_8, ..., a_{7+H-1}. And we have H actions? Then at turn 7+H, we are at (0,9). \n\n      How does the indexing work?\n          At turn7 (current turn), we are at (0,5). Then we take action a_7 -> then at turn8, we are at (0,y1). Then ... until at turn7+H, we are at (0,9). So we have H actions: from a_7 to a_{7+H-1}, and then at turn7+H we are at 9.\n\n      Therefore, we must simulate until we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, and then H = T - 7.\n\n      But note: we start at turn7 at position5. Then if we don't move, we are still at turn7 at position5? But we are already at the beginning of turn7. Then we take an action at turn7 to move to turn8.\n\n      So the state at the beginning of turn7: (7,5). Then we take action a7 to get to the beginning of turn8: (8, y').\n\n      Therefore, we are looking for the smallest T (>=8) such that at the beginning of turn T, we are at y=9. Then H = T - 7.\n\n      And the actions we take: at turn7, turn8, ..., turn T-1. That is, T-7 actions.\n\n      So we break when we have a state (T,9) for T>=8, and then we output the actions from turn7 to turn T-1.\n\n      But note: we must check that at the state (T,9) we are at freeway9? Actually, y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So at turn T, we are at y=9 -> no collision. So we don't need to check for cars at y=9.\n\n6. Implementation:\n\n   We'll do a BFS:\n\n      Let Q be a queue of (t, y, path) \n          where path is the list of actions taken from turn7 to turn t-1 (so the action at turn t-1 is the last one in the list).\n\n      We start: t=7, y=5, path=[].\n\n      Then we check: at (7,5): if y in [1,8] -> check freeway5 at turn7: as we did, safe. Then we mark (7,5) as visited.\n\n      Then we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n        For U: next y' = min(9,5+1)=6 -> next state (8,6). Then we check (8,6): is it safe? We must compute the car spans on freeway6 at turn8.\n\n        Similarly for D: (8,4) and for S: (8,5).\n\n      Then we push these states if they are safe and not visited.\n\n      We continue until we get a state (t,9) for any t.\n\n   However, note: we must check the safety of the state (t,y) at the beginning of turn t. So for the next state (t,y) we are going to push, we check if y in [1,8] -> then check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\n   Steps in BFS:\n\n      while Q not empty:\n          pop (t, y, path)\n          if y == 9: then we have found the solution. H = t - 7, and the actions are path (which has length = t-7).\n\n          Otherwise, for each action a in {U, D, S}:\n             next_y = \n                 if a==U: min(9, y+1)\n                 if a==D: max(0, y-1)\n                 if a==S: y\n             next_t = t+1\n\n             Then we check the state (next_t, next_y): \n                 if next_y is 0 or 9: safe (no cars) -> then we can push if not visited.\n                 else (next_y in [1,8]): \n                     compute the car spans on freeway k=next_y at turn T = next_t.\n\n                     For each car on freeway k (from the table), compute the span at turn next_t (which is T = next_t, and t1=7, so T-t1 = next_t - 7).\n\n                     Check if 0 is in any of the spans.\n\n                     If not, then safe.\n\n             If safe and (next_t, next_y) not visited, then push (next_t, next_y, path + [a])\n\n      We mark visited for (t,y) to avoid cycles? But the grid is small (y in 0..9) and time increases, but we might get the same y at a later time? But we are doing BFS in increasing t, so we don't need to mark visited for (t,y) for the same t? Actually, for a fixed t, we might have multiple ways to get to the same y. We only need to consider the first time we get to (t,y) because we are doing BFS and we want minimal H. But note: we are only storing the path, and we break at the first time we reach 9. However, we might get to (t,y) by a shorter path? Actually, the time t is increasing by 1 each step, and we are doing BFS by time (each level is one time step). So the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\n      However, we might get to the same (t,y) by two different paths at the same time step? Then we only need one. So we can mark visited per (t,y).\n\n      But note: the same (t,y) might be reached by different paths and we want to avoid duplicate work. So we use a visited set: visited[t][y] = True.\n\n      However, the state space: t can go up to ... we don't know. But note: the minimal H should be at most 10? Because from 5 to 9: at least 4 steps if we go up every time. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars. So H might be more than 4.\n\n      But we don't know the upper bound. However, the cars are moving and the patterns are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed and the grid is infinite? But the positions are linear in time. We can compute the exact condition.\n\n      Alternatively, we can run BFS until we find the goal. Since the minimal H is bounded (we can set a limit, say 100 turns) and if we don't find, then we break? But 100 is safe.\n\n7. Precomputation for car spans:\n\n   We have the initial state at t1=7.\n\n   For a given freeway k and turn T (>=7), we can compute the car spans:\n\n      For each car on freeway k: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h0, tau0, d, s)\n\n      Let dt = T - 7.\n\n      If d == 'right':\n          tail_T = tau0 + s * dt\n          head_T = h0 + s * dt\n          The span is [tail_T, head_T] (if tail_T <= head_T, which it should be because for right-moving, tail0 <= head0? Actually, the table: for right-moving, the head is the right end and tail is the left end? But the table entry: (head, tail) = (h0, tau0). For example, freeway1: (12,1,right,12): head0=12, tail0=1 -> so tail0< head0. Then the span is [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]. \n\n      But wait: the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h]? Then at T: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if the table gives (h0, tau0) for the car, then we have to use tau = tau0 and h = h0? \n\n      How is the table given? The table says: (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\n          For a right-moving car: the initial span at t1=7 is [tail, head] = [tau0, h0]. Then at turn T: [tau0 + s*(T-7), h0 + s*(T-7)].\n\n          For a left-moving car: the initial span at t1=7 is [head, tail]? But the problem says: for left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau] -> meaning [head, tail]. Then at T: [head - s*(T-7), tail - s*(T-7)].\n\n      But note: for left-moving, the head is the left end? Actually, the problem says: \"left-moving: head, tail\" and then the initial span is [h, tau]. So if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? Then the table entry for a left-moving car: (head, tail) = (24,47) for freeway3? Then the initial span is [24,47]. But that would be a car that extends from 24 to 47? Then when moving left, the entire car moves left. So at T: [24-24*(T-7), 47-24*(T-7)]. \n\n      But note: in the table, for freeway3: (24,47,left,24). Then at T=7: [24,47]. This does not contain 0. At T=8: [24-24, 47-24] = [0,23]. This contains 0? So at T=8, freeway3 has a car that covers 0.\n\n      However, wait: the problem says for left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau]? and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So yes, at T=8: [24-24, 47-24] = [0,23] -> contains 0.\n\n      So if the player is on freeway3 at turn8, then collision.\n\n8. Now, we code the BFS with a time limit (say up to t=200) to avoid infinite loop.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      from collections import deque\n      visited = set()  # we can store (t,y) as tuples.\n\n      Q: deque of (t, y, path)\n\n      Start: (7,5, [])\n\n      visited.add((7,5))\n\n      while Q:\n          pop state (t,y,path)\n          if y==9: \n              H = len(path)   # because we took len(path) actions to get to this state? \n              But note: we are at (t,y) at the beginning of turn t. We took the actions at turns 7 to t-1. So the number of actions is t-7. And the path has length t-7.\n\n              Then we output the actions: for i in range(len(path)):\n                  Turn 7+i: path[i]\n\n              And break.\n\n          Else:\n             For each action in ['U','D','S']:\n                 next_y = \n                     if 'U': min(9, y+1)\n                     if 'D': max(0, y-1)\n                     if 'S': y\n                 next_t = t+1\n\n                 # Check if we have visited (next_t, next_y) -> if yes, skip.\n                 if (next_t, next_y) in visited: \n                     continue\n\n                 # Check safety at state (next_t, next_y): \n                 if next_y == 0 or next_y == 9:\n                     safe = True\n                 else:\n                     # freeway k = next_y\n                     cars = car_state[next_y]   # list of cars on freeway next_y: each car is (h0, tau0, d, s)\n                     safe = True\n                     dt = next_t - 7   # because initial state at t1=7\n                     for car in cars:\n                         h0, tau0, d, s = car\n                         if d == 'right':\n                             tail_T = tau0 + s * dt\n                             head_T = h0 + s * dt\n                             # the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since tail_T should be <= head_T)\n                             if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T:\n                                 safe = False\n                                 break\n                         elif d == 'left':\n                             # initial: [h0, tau0] -> then at T: [h0 - s*dt, tau0 - s*dt]\n                             # note: for left-moving, the head is the left end? and tail is the right end? \n                             # But the problem: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n                             left_end = h0 - s * dt\n                             right_end = tau0 - s * dt\n                             # But note: in the table, for left-moving, the head and tail: is head0 <= tau0? \n                             # Example: freeway3: (24,47,left,24) -> head0=24, tail0=47 -> so 24<=47 -> so the car is from 24 to 47.\n                             # Then the span at T: [24-24*dt, 47-24*dt]. \n                             # So we have left_end = h0 - s*dt, right_end = tau0 - s*dt.\n                             if left_end <= right_end:\n                                 if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                                     safe = False\n                                     break\n                             else:\n                                 # This should not happen? because head0<=tau0 for left-moving? \n                                 # But if the car is defined with head0>tau0? Then the interval would be [tau0 - s*dt, head0 - s*dt] but we have to take the min and max?\n                                 # Actually, the problem says the initial span is [h, tau] and then shifts. But the interval is from min(h,tau) to max(h,tau)? \n                                 # However, the problem does not specify. But looking at the example: freeway3: (24,47) -> 24<47, so the car is from 24 to 47. \n                                 # So we assume that for a left-moving car, the initial head is the left end and tail is the right end, so head0<=tau0.\n                                 # Similarly, for right-moving: tail0<=head0? \n                                 # In the table: freeway1: (12,1,right,12) -> head0=12, tail0=1 -> so tail0<=head0 -> [1,12].\n                                 # freeway5: (-36,-47,right,4) -> tail0=-47, head0=-36 -> so [-47,-36] -> still tail0<=head0? -47<=-36 -> true.\n                                 # So we can assume that for any car, the initial head and tail are such that the left end is the minimum and the right end is the maximum? \n                                 # Actually, the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] and tau is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end).

But note: we must check the initial state (7,5) is safe? We did. And we start by pushing (7,5,[]). Then we pop it and then we generate the next states.\n\n   However, we must also check that we don't go beyond a time limit? We set a max_t, say 100.\n\n   We'll run until we find the goal.\n\n10. Now, let's code the car_state:\n\n    We are given:\n\n        Freeway 1: [(12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12)]\n        Freeway 2: [(96,49,'right',48)]\n        Freeway 3: [(24,47,'left',24)]\n        Freeway 4: [(36,25,'right',12), (-48,-59,'right',12), (-12,-23,'right',12)]\n        Freeway 5: [(-36,-47,'right',4)]\n        Freeway 6: [(-36,-47,'right',4), (40,29,'right',4), (4,-7,'right',4)]   # note: (40,29) -> so tail0=29, head0=40? But wait: the table says: (head, tail) so head0=40, tail0=29? Then for right-moving: [29,40]. But 29<=40 -> ok.\n        Freeway 7: [(12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12)]\n        Freeway 8: [(12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12)]\n\n    We note: freeway6: (40,29,right,4) -> head0=40, tail0=29 -> then the initial span at t1=7: [29,40]. Then at turn T: [29+4*(T-7), 40+4*(T-7)]\n\n    But wait: the problem says for right-moving: [tau, head] -> so the table gives (head, tail) meaning head and tail? Then we use tau = tail and head = head. So yes.\n\n    However, note: the table says: (head, tail) for every car. So we have to use:\n\n        for a car: (head, tail, direction, speed) -> then for the span:\n\n            if direction=='right': \n                left_end = tail + s * (T-7)\n                right_end = head + s * (T-7)\n\n            if direction=='left':\n                left_end = head - s * (T-7)\n                right_end = tail - s * (T-7)\n\n    Then check if 0 in [left_end, right_end] (closed interval).\n\n11. Let's test with freeway3 at turn8: \n        car: (24,47,left,24) -> direction='left'\n        T=8, dt=1\n        left_end = 24 - 24*1 = 0\n        right_end = 47 - 24*1 = 23\n        so [0,23] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\n12. Now, we code accordingly.\n\n    We'll create a dictionary for car_state:\n\n        car_state = {\n            1: [ (12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12) ],\n            2: [ (96,49,'right',48) ],\n            3: [ (24,47,'left',24) ],\n            4: [ (36,25,'right',12), (-48,-59,'right',12), (-12,-23,'right',12) ],\n            5: [ (-36,-47,'right',4) ],\n            6: [ (-36,-47,'right',4), (40,29,'right',4), (4,-7,'right',4) ],\n            7: [ (12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12) ],\n            8: [ (12,1,'right',12), (-36,-47,'right',12) ]\n        }\n\n    Note: freeway6: the car (4,-7,right,4) -> head0=4, tail0=-7 -> then the initial span: [-7,4]. Then at T: [-7+4*dt, 4+4*dt]. At dt=0: [-7,4] -> contains 0? Actually, -7<=0<=4 -> yes! But wait, at turn7, if the player is on freeway6, then it would be unsafe? \n\n        But at turn7, the player is at (0,5) -> freeway5. Then for freeway6 at turn7: \n            car1: (-36,-47,right,4): [-47+0, -36+0] = [-47,-36] -> no 0.\n            car2: (40,29,right,4): [29,40] -> no 0? 0 not in [29,40] -> false.\n            car3: (4,-7,right,4): [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> so freeway6 at turn7 is unsafe.\n\n        But the player is not on freeway6 at turn7. However, if the player moves to freeway6 at turn8, then we check freeway6 at turn8.\n\n        For car3 at turn8 (dt=1): [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n        So freeway6 is unsafe at turn8? \n\n        Actually, we must check all cars: \n            car1: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43, -32] -> no.\n            car2: [29+4,40+4] = [33,44] -> no.\n            car3: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> yes, 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n        So at turn8, freeway6 is unsafe.\n\n13. Now, we code the BFS.\n\n    We set a time limit to avoid infinite loop? But we expect the minimal H to be around 4 to 10? But we might have to wait. We set max_t = 100.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        from collections import deque\n        visited = set()\n        queue = deque()\n        start = (7, 5, [])   # (t, y, path)\n        visited.add((7,5))\n        queue.append(start)\n\n        car_state = { ... }   # as above\n\n        while queue:\n            t, y, path = queue.popleft()\n\n            if y == 9:\n                # We have reached the goal at the beginning of turn t.\n                # The actions are in path, and the number of actions is len(path) = t-7.\n                # Output the actions from turn7 to turn t-1.\n                for i in range(len(path)):\n                    turn = 7 + i\n                    action = path[i]\n                    print(f\"Turn {turn}: a_{turn} = {action}\")\n                # But the problem says: \n                #   Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n                #   Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\n                #   ...\n                # So we output for turn7, turn8, ... turn t-1.\n                # And we break.\n                break\n\n            # If we are at time t and we want to take an action to go to t+1.\n            for action in ['U','D','S']:\n                if action == 'U':\n                    next_y = min(9, y+1)\n                elif action == 'D':\n                    next_y = max(0, y-1)\n                else: # 'S'\n                    next_y = y\n\n                next_t = t+1\n\n                if (next_t, next_y) in visited:\n                    continue\n\n                # Check safety at (next_t, next_y)\n                if next_y == 0 or next_y == 9:\n                    safe = True\n                else:\n                    safe = True\n                    dt = next_t - 7   # because initial state at t1=7\n                    cars = car_state[next_y]\n                    for (head, tail, d, s) in cars:\n                        if d == 'right':\n                            left_end = tail + s * dt\n                            right_end = head + s * dt\n                            if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                                safe = False\n                                break\n                        elif d == 'left':\n                            # For left-moving: the initial span is [head, tail] -> becomes [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt]\n                            left_end = head - s * dt\n                            right_end = tail - s * dt\n                            if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                                safe = False\n                                break\n\n                if safe:\n                    visited.add((next_t, next_y))\n                    new_path = path + [action]\n                    queue.append( (next_t, next_y, new_path) )\n\n        # If we break, we are done.\n\n    However, what if we never break?

Let's run the BFS and see what we get.\n\n    We start at (7,5): safe.\n\n    Then we consider actions at turn7: U, D, S.\n\n        U: next state (8,6) -> check freeway6 at turn8: as above, unsafe -> skip.\n        D: next state (8,4) -> freeway4 at turn8: \n            cars on freeway4: \n                car1: (36,25,right,12) -> [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> no 0 -> safe.\n                car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> no.\n                car3: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? yes, because -11<=0<=0 -> true -> unsafe.\n            so freeway4 at turn8 is unsafe -> skip.\n\n        S: next state (8,5) -> freeway5 at turn8: \n            cars: [(-36,-47,right,4)] -> at dt=1: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43,-32] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        So we push (8,5,['S'])\n\n    Then we pop (8,5,['S'])\n\n        Now at (8,5): safe? We check: at the beginning of turn8, we are at freeway5: \n            car: [-47+4*(8-7), -36+4*(8-7)] = [-43,-32] -> safe.\n\n        Then we consider actions:\n\n            U: (9,6) -> freeway6 at turn9: \n                dt=2\n                car1: [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> no.\n                car2: [29+4*2,40+4*2] = [37,48] -> no.\n                car3: [-7+4*2,4+4*2] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe! \n                So freeway6 at turn9 is safe.\n\n            D: (9,4) -> freeway4 at turn9: \n                dt=2\n                car1: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [49,60] -> no.\n                car2: [-59+12*2, -48+12*2] = [-35,-24] -> no.\n                car3: [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n            S: (9,5) -> freeway5 at turn9: \n                car: [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n        So we can push all three: (9,6,['S','U']), (9,4,['S','D']), (9,5,['S','S'])\n\n    Now, we pop states in order. Since we are doing BFS, we get the minimal H. The goal is 9, so if we get (9,9) we break? But note: we are at turn9 and y=6,4,5 -> not 9.\n\n    But we want to get to 9. So we continue.\n\n    However, note: from (9,6) we can do U to (10,7) -> but we are getting ahead.\n\n    We want the minimal H. The H for a state (t,y) is t-7. We are at turn9: H so far is 2 actions. We need to get to 9.\n\n    Let's see which state reaches 9 first.\n\n    We continue:\n\n        We have (9,6,['S','U']): \n            Actions: \n                U: (10,7) -> freeway7 at turn10: \n                    cars: \n                         car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*3, 12+12*3] = [37,48] -> no.\n                         car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n                D: (10,5) -> freeway5 at turn10: \n                    dt=3: [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n                S: (10,6) -> freeway6 at turn10: \n                    dt=3: \n                         car1: [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-35,-24] -> no.\n                         car2: [29+4*3,40+4*3] = [41,52] -> no.\n                         car3: [-7+4*3,4+4*3] = [5,16] -> no.\n                    safe.\n\n        We push (10,5,['S','U','D']) and (10,6,['S','U','S'])\n\n        Similarly, from (9,4,['S','D']):\n            U: (10,5) -> freeway5 at turn10: safe -> push (10,5,['S','D','U'])\n            D: (10,3) -> freeway3 at turn10: \n                car: (24,47,left,24) -> at dt=3: [24-24*3, 47-24*3] = [24-72, 47-72] = [-48,-25] -> no 0 -> safe -> push (10,3,['S','D','D'])\n            S: (10,4) -> freeway4 at turn10: \n                dt=3: \n                    car1: [25+12*3,36+12*3] = [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> no.\n                    car2: [-59+12*3, -48+12*3]=[-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> no.\n                    car3: [-23+12*3, -12+12*3]=[13,24] -> no.\n                safe -> push (10,4,['S','D','S'])\n\n        From (9,5,['S','S']):\n            ... similar.\n\n    We see that we haven't reached 9 yet.\n\n    We continue until we find a path to 9.\n\n    However, note: we might go up as much as possible. The minimal steps in the absence of cars: from 5 to 9: 4 steps (U,U,U,U). But we saw at turn8, we couldn't go to 6 because of freeway6. Then at turn9, we can go to 6? But then from 6 we can go to 7 at turn10? But freeway7 at turn10 is unsafe? Then we have to avoid freeway7 at turn10.\n\n    Alternatively, we can go:\n\n        Turn7: S -> to (8,5) [safe]\n        Turn8: S -> to (9,5) [safe]\n        Turn9: U -> to (10,6) [safe, as above for freeway6 at turn10: safe]\n        Turn10: U -> to (11,7) -> freeway7 at turn11: \n            dt=4\n            car1: [1+12*4,12+12*4]=[49,60] -> no.\n            car2: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? But 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        Turn11: U -> to (12,8) -> freeway8 at turn12: \n            dt=5\n            car1: [1+12*5,12+12*5]=[61,72] -> no.\n            car2: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [13,24] -> no.\n            safe.\n        Turn12: U -> to (13,9) -> goal.\n\n        So the actions: \n            Turn7: S\n            Turn8: S\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n\n        H = 6.\n\n        But we can do better? \n\n        Alternatively, at turn9 we are at 6, then we can do:\n\n            Turn9: U -> (10,7) -> but freeway7 at turn10: unsafe (we saw: car2: [-11,0] -> 0 in the span) -> so that move is unsafe.\n\n        So the above path is one possibility.\n\n    But wait: from (9,5) at turn9, we can do U to (10,6) [safe] and then at turn10 we are at 6, then we can do U again to (11,7) [freeway7 at turn11: safe as above] and then U to (12,8) and then U to (13,9). That's 6 actions.\n\n    However, we can also from (9,5) do U to (10,6) and then wait? \n\n        But we want minimal turns. \n\n    But is there a shorter path? \n\n        The minimal number of moves upward is 4. We start at 5, need to get to 9: 4 steps. But we have to avoid unsafe positions.\n\n        Let's try to do 4 U's:\n\n            Turn7: U -> (8,6) -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn8: unsafe) -> not possible.\n\n            Turn7: D -> (8,4) -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn8: unsafe) -> not possible.\n\n            Turn7: S -> (8,5) [safe]\n\n            Then at turn8: \n                We can try U: (9,6) -> safe? freeway6 at turn9: \n                    car3: [ -7+4*2, 4+4*2] = [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe. So we can go to (9,6) at turn9.\n\n            Then at turn9: \n                We can do U: (10,7) -> freeway7 at turn10: \n                    car2: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n                So we cannot do U at turn9.\n\n            Then at turn9: \n                We can do S: (10,6) -> safe (as above) \n                Or D: (10,5) -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn10: \n                If we are at 6: we can do U to (11,7) -> freeway7 at turn11: \n                    car2: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [1,12] -> safe? because 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n                Then at turn11: U to (12,8) -> freeway8 at turn12: \n                    car2: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [13,24] -> safe.\n                Then at turn12: U to (13,9) -> goal.\n\n                This is 6 actions: [S, U, S, U, U, U]? \n                    Turn7: S\n                    Turn8: U -> to (9,6)\n                    Turn9: S -> to (10,6)\n                    Turn10: U -> to (11,7)\n                    Turn11: U -> to (12,8)\n                    Turn12: U -> to (13,9)\n\n                H=6.\n\n            Alternatively, at turn9 we do D: then we are at 5 at turn10, then we can do U four times? That would be longer.\n\n        So minimal H is 6.\n\n        But note: we can do:\n\n            Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n            Turn8: S -> (9,5)\n            Turn9: U -> (10,6)\n            Turn10: U -> (11,7) [safe at turn11? no: we are at turn11? Actually, we are at state (11,7) at the beginning of turn11. Then we check freeway7 at turn11: \n                car2: [-47+12*(11-7) = -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            Turn11: U -> (12,8) [freeway8 at turn12: car2: [-47+12*5=13, -36+12*5=24] -> safe]\n            Turn12: U -> (13,9)\n\n            Also 6 actions.\n\n        But we can try to avoid the wait at turn9? \n\n        What if we do:\n\n            Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n            Turn8: U -> (9,6) [safe at turn9? yes, freeway6 at turn9: car3: [1,12] -> safe? but 0 not in [1,12] -> safe]\n            Turn9: U -> (10,7) [unsafe at turn10: freeway7 at turn10: car2: [-11,0] -> unsafe] -> not possible.\n\n        So we must wait at turn9? \n\n        Alternatively, we can go down? \n\n            Turn7: D -> unsafe? we saw turn8 at freeway4 unsafe -> so we cannot go down at turn7.\n\n            Turn7: S -> (8,5) \n            Turn8: D -> (9,4) [freeway4 at turn9: safe? \n                car1: [25+12*2,36+12*2]=[49,60] -> no\n                car2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> no\n                car3: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> no\n                safe.\n\n            Then at turn9: \n                We can do U: (10,5) [freeway5 at turn10: [-47+12, -36+12]? wait, freeway5: car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at dt=3: [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n                Then at turn10: U to (11,6) -> freeway6 at turn11: \n                    car3: [-7+4*4,4+4*4] = [9,20] -> no 0 -> safe.\n                Then turn11: U to (12,7) -> freeway7 at turn12: \n                    car2: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [13,24] -> safe.\n                Then turn12: U to (13,8) -> freeway8 at turn13: \n                    car2: [-47+12*6, -36+12*6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n                Then turn13: U to (14,9) -> goal.\n\n                This is 7 actions: [S, D, U, U, U, U, U] -> longer.\n\n        So the minimal H is 6.\n\n        Now, we have two sequences of 6 actions:\n\n            Option1: S, S, U, U, U, U   -> \n                Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n                Turn8: S -> (9,5)\n                Turn9: U -> (10,6)\n                Turn10: U -> (11,7)\n                Turn11: U -> (12,8)\n                Turn12: U -> (13,9)\n\n            Option2: S, U, S, U, U, U   ->\n                Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n                Turn8: U -> (9,6)\n                Turn9: S -> (10,6)\n                Turn10: U -> (11,7)\n                Turn11: U -> (12,8)\n                Turn12: U -> (13,9)\n\n        Both are 6 actions.\n\n        But which one is found first in BFS? \n\n        In BFS, we explore by time. At time t=8, we have two states: (8,5) and (8,4) and (8,5) was pushed first? Actually, we pushed (8,5) from the first step (action S) and then we pushed (8,4) and (8,5) again? But we use visited per (t,y). So at t=8, we pushed (8,5) and then we also pushed (8,4) and (8,5) is already visited so we skip the S action from (8,5) to (9,5) is the same as from (8,5) to (9,5) and we push (9,5) only once.\n\n        Then at t=9, we have states: (9,6), (9,4), (9,5). We pushed (9,6) from (8,5) with action U, then (9,4) from (8,5) with action D? But we skipped D at turn7 because unsafe? Actually, at turn7 we only pushed (8,5) from the initial state with action S. Then at (8,5) we considered actions and pushed (9,6), (9,4), (9,5). \n\n        Then at t=9, we pop (9,6) first? Then we try actions: U -> unsafe, D -> (10,5), S->(10,6). Then we push (10,5) and (10,6).\n\n        Then we pop (9,4): and so on.\n\n        Then we pop (9,5): and then we try U -> (10,6) and we mark (10,6) as visited? So if we already pushed (10,6) from (9,6) with action S, then we skip.\n\n        Then we continue: we pop (10,5) and (10,6) at t=10.\n\n        From (10,6): we try U -> (11,7) -> safe -> then we push (11,7) with path: for example, from (9,6) then S to (10,6): path=['S','U','S'] -> then U to (11,7): path=['S','U','S','U'].\n\n        Then from (11,7): U to (12,8) -> safe -> push (12,8) with path extended by 'U'.\n\n        Then from (12,8): U to (13,9) -> goal.\n\n        Then we output: \n            Turn7: S\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: S\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n\n        This is option2.\n\n        Alternatively, if we had chosen at (9,5) to go U to (10,6) but we skip because (10,6) is visited? Then we don't push. But then we would have found the goal at the same time? \n\n        Actually, the first time we reach the goal is at turn13? So the two options have the same H.\n\n        But note: we break when we first reach y=9? So the first path that reaches (13,9) we break. \n\n        How we traverse the states? \n\n        We use a queue (BFS) and we traverse in increasing t. So we will first reach (13,9) via the first path that gets there. \n\n        Since both options take 6 actions and the goal is reached at turn13, the first one we find is the one we output.\n\n        We don't care which as long as H is minimal.\n\n    However, we can also consider a path that goes up faster? \n\n        What if we do:\n\n            Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n            Turn8: S -> (9,5)\n            Turn9: S -> (10,5) [safe? freeway5 at turn10: [-35,-24] -> safe]\n            Turn10: U -> (11,6) [freeway6 at turn11: car3: [ -7+4*4, 4+4*4] = [9,20] -> safe]\n            Turn11: U -> (12,7) [freeway7 at turn12: car2: [13,24] -> safe]\n            Turn12: U -> (13,8) [freeway8 at turn13: car2: [25,36] -> safe]\n            Turn13: U -> (14,9) -> goal: 7 actions -> not minimal.\n\n    So we stick with 6 actions.\n\n    But note: we can do:\n\n        Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n        Turn8: U -> (9,6) [safe at turn9: freeway6 at turn9: car3: [1,12] -> safe]\n        Turn9: D -> (10,5) [safe] \n        Turn10: U -> (11,6) [safe]\n        Turn11: U -> (12,7) [safe]\n        Turn12: U -> (13,8) [safe]\n        Turn13: U -> (14,9) -> 7 actions.\n\n    So the minimal is 6.\n\n    Therefore, we output the first 6-action sequence that reaches 9.\n\n    We'll run the BFS and output the sequence.\n\n    However, we must check the freeway states carefully.\n\n    We already did for the first few steps.\n\n    We'll code accordingly.\n\n    We'll create the car_state dictionary and run the BFS.\n\n    We'll output the sequence for the first path that reaches y=9.\n\n    We assume that the BFS will find the minimal H.\n\n    Let's code.\n\n    Note: the car_state for freeway6: the car (4,-7,right,4) -> head=4, tail=-7 -> so at T: [ -7+4*(T-7), 4+4*(T-7) ]\n\n    We'll implement the BFS.\n\n    We break when we reach y=9.\n\n    We'll run and see what we get.\n\n    We hope for a 6-action sequence.\n\n    But note: we might find a 5-action sequence? \n\n        From 5 to 9: 4 moves. But we start at turn7. Then we need 4 actions: turn7,8,9,10 -> then at turn11 we are at 9? \n\n        How? \n\n            Turn7: U -> (8,6) -> unsafe -> not possible.\n\n            So 4 actions is impossible.\n\n        Then 5 actions: we do 4 moves and one wait? \n\n            Example: \n                Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n                Turn8: U -> (9,6) [safe]\n                Turn9: U -> (10,7) [unsafe] -> not possible.\n\n                Turn7: S -> (8,5)\n                Turn8: S -> (9,5)\n                Turn9: U -> (10,6) [safe]\n                Turn10: U -> (11,7) [safe? freeway7 at turn11: [1,12] -> safe]\n                Turn11: U -> (12,8) [safe]\n                Turn12: U -> (13,9) -> 6 actions.\n\n            We don't see a 5-action sequence.\n\n        So minimal is 6.\n\n    We run the BFS and output.\n\n    We'll write the code in pseudocode and then run manually or we can run in mind.\n\n    We start:\n\n        t0=7, y0=5, path=[] -> safe.\n\n        Then we generate:\n\n            U: (8,6) -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn8: car3: [-3,8] contains 0) -> skip.\n            D: (8,4) -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn8: car3: [-11,0] contains 0) -> skip.\n            S: (8,5) -> safe -> push (8,5,['S'])\n\n        Then we pop (8,5,['S'])\n\n            Generate:\n                U: (9,6) -> freeway6 at turn9: \n                    car1: [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> no.\n                    car2: [29+8,40+8] = [37,48] -> no.\n                    car3: [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe -> push (9,6,['S','U'])\n                D: (9,4) -> freeway4 at turn9: \n                    car1: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> no.\n                    car2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> no.\n                    car3: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> no -> safe -> push (9,4,['S','D'])\n                S: (9,5) -> freeway5 at turn9: \n                    car: [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39,-28] -> no -> safe -> push (9,5,['S','S'])\n\n        Then we pop the first: (9,6,['S','U'])\n\n            Generate:\n                U: (10,7) -> freeway7 at turn10: \n                    car1: [1+12*3,12+12*3]=[37,48] -> no.\n                    car2: [-47+36, -36+36]=[-11,0] -> contains 0 -> unsafe -> skip.\n                D: (10,5) -> freeway5 at turn10: \n                    car: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe -> push (10,5,['S','U','D'])\n                S: (10,6) -> freeway6 at turn10: \n                    car1: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> no.\n                    car2: [29+12,40+12]=[41,52] -> no.\n                    car3: [-7+12,4+12]=[5,16] -> no -> safe -> push (10,6,['S','U','S'])\n\n        Then we pop (9,4,['S','D']): we skip for now.\n\n        Then we pop (9,5,['S','S']): \n            U: (10,6) -> if (10,6) is not visited?

We take action S -> so y8 = y7 + 0 = 5.\n            Then at the beginning of turn8, we are at (0,5). Then we take action U -> so y9 = min(9,5+1)=6.\n            Then at the beginning of turn9, we are at (0,6). Then action S -> so y10 = 6.\n            Then at turn10: action U -> y11=7.\n            Then turn11: U -> y12=8.\n            Then turn12: U -> y13=9.\n\n        And at turn13, we are at (0,9) -> goal.\n\n        Now, check collisions:\n\n            Turn7: at (0,5) -> freeway5: safe.\n            Turn8: at (0,5) -> freeway5: safe (as computed).\n            Turn9: at (0,6) -> freeway6: at turn9: \n                car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n            Turn10: at (0,6) -> freeway6: at turn10: [5,16] -> safe.\n            Turn11: at (0,7) -> freeway7: at turn11: [1,12] -> safe.\n            Turn12: at (0,8) -> freeway8: at turn12: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n    Therefore, we output.\n\n    But note: there is another path that we found: \n        Turn7: S\n        Turn8: S\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n\n    That also works. But the BFS found the one with action U at turn8 first.\n\n    We output the one we found.\n\n    So the answer:\n\n        Turn 7: S\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: S\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n    In the boxed format:\n\n        \\boxed{\n            Turn 7: S \\\\\n            Turn 8: U \\\\\n            Turn 9: S \\\\\n            Turn 10: U \\\\\n            Turn 11: U \\\\\n            Turn 12: U\n        }\n\n    But the problem says: \"a_{t_1 + t}\" for t=0 to H-1. Here, t_1=7, H=6, so t from 0 to 5: \n        a_7 (t=0): S\n        a_8 (t=1): U\n        a_9 (t=2): S\n        a_10 (t=3): U\n        a_11 (t=4): U\n        a_12 (t=5): U\n\n    So we write:\n\n        Turn 7: S\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: S\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n    This is the same.\n\n    We'll output accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but we don't need to output H, only the sequence. And we have H=6.\n\n    But we output the sequence for 6 turns.\n\n    So the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 7, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8, is achieved in 6 turns. The sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 7, the player is at (0, 5). Taking action 'S' (stay) keeps the player at (0, 5), which is safe as freeway 5 at turn 7 has no car covering x=0 (car spans are [-47, -36]).\n- At turn 8, the player is at (0, 5). Taking action 'U' (up) moves to (0, 6). This is safe as freeway 6 at turn 9 (after movement) has car spans: car1 [-39, -28], car2 [37, 48], car3 [1, 12]; none cover x=0.\n- At turn 9, the player is at (0, 6). Taking action 'S' (stay) keeps the player at (0, 6). This is safe as freeway 6 at turn 10 has car spans: car1 [-35, -24], car2 [41, 52], car3 [5, 16]; none cover x=0.\n- At turn 10, the player is at (0, 6). Taking action 'U' (up) moves to (0, 7). This is safe as freeway 7 at turn 11 has car spans: car1 [37, 48], car2 [1, 12]; none cover x=0.\n- At turn 11, the player is at (0, 7). Taking action 'U' (up) moves to (0, 8). This is safe as freeway 8 at turn 12 has car spans: car1 [61, 72], car2 [13, 24]; none cover x=0.\n- At turn 12, the player is at (0, 8). Taking action 'U' (up) moves to (0, 9), achieving the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in minimal turns (H=6) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and if you move, at T+1 you're on y_{T+1}. So for collision, it's based on where you are at the start of the turn, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning that at turn T, you're still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nSo, when you take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe collision check is at the beginning of the turn, based on the position before the move? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, you are at position y_T. Then you choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T, meaning when you are at y_T, and it depends on the cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAfter you move, at T+1, you are at y_{T+1}, and collision is checked based on cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=9, and we can compute for future turns T based on that.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at turn 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9 because freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I need to go to 9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I'm at 6, and 9 is 3 above, in theory I could go up 3 times, but I need to avoid cars on the way.\n\nI have to pass through y=7 and y=8 to get to y=9.\n\ny=6 to y=9, so I need to be at y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut I might stay or move down to avoid cars, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but in some cases it might to wait.\n\nBut let's see the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to compute the car positions at different turns.\n\nThe cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nFor each freeway, there are multiple cars with their positions at t=9.\n\nThe position is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so for turn T, span is [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, [τ, h] to [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway k, it lists cars with (h, τ, d, s)\n\nLet me list all cars at t=9 for each freeway.\n\nt_1 = 9.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSince right-moving, the span at t=9 is [τ, h] = for first car: tail τ=25, head h=36? No.\n\nIn the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ], head to tail.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), so for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], for left, [h, τ].\n\nFor freeway 1, both cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12. So span at t=9 is [25, 36]\n\nSecond car: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12. Span at t=9: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nNow, collision occurs if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nFreeway 2: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nh=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48. Span at t=9: [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\n0 is included, since [ -47, 0 ], 0 is the upper end.\n\nFreeway 3: (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nd=left, so at t=9, span is [h, τ] = [-24, -1]\n\nNow, freeway 4: three cars: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, span [49,60]\n\nSecond: h=-24, τ=-35, span [-35,-24]\n\nThird: h=12, τ=1, span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 5: (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nOne car, right-moving, h=-28, τ=-39, span [-39,-28]\n\nFreeway 6: three cars: (-28,-39,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst: h=-28, τ=-39, span [-39,-28]\n\nSecond: h=48, τ=37, span [37,48]\n\nThird: h=12, τ=1, span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 1: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSpan [25,36] and [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 1 and 7: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSpan [25,36] and [-23,-12]\n\nNow, the player is at y=6 at turn t=9.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 9, player is on y=6.\n\nCheck if collision at t=9 on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: span [-39,-28], [37,48], [1,12]\n\nIs 0 in any span? [-39,-28]: 0 > -28, not in. [37,48]: 0 < 37, not in. [1,12]: 1 to 12, 0 not in. So no collision at t=9 on y=6.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I go U at t=9, then y_{10} = 7.\n\nThen at t=10, I'm on y=7, need to check cars on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go S, stay at y=6 for t=10.\n\nOr D, to y=5, but that might be counterproductive.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably U or S to time the moves.\n\nMinimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the critical freeways: y=7 and y=8, since I have to pass through them.\n\ny=6 is where I am, but I can leave immediately.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, cars same as 1 and 8: at t=9, spans [25,36] and [-23,-12]\n\nFor future turn T, let dt = T - 9.\n\nSpan for first car: right-moving, [25 + 12*dt, 36 + 12*dt]? No.\n\nGeneral formula: for right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1=9, τ and h are given.\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: τ=25, h=36, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 12*(T-9), 36 + 12*(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=-23? h=-12, τ=-23? In state it's (h,τ,d,s) = (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSo τ = -23, h = -12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-23 + 12*(T-9), -12 + 12*(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision on y=7 at turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nPlayer starts at t=9, y=6.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can consider the position over time.\n\nLet me denote dt = T - 9, so at time dt, turn is T=9+dt.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T.\n\ny_{9} = 6\n\ny_{10} = 6 + Δy_9\n\ny_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, etc.\n\nI need y_{9+H-1} = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince from 6 to 9, minimum 3 moves up, so H at least 3.\n\nBut with possible waits, H could be more.\n\nFirst, can I go up directly?\n\nSuppose I go U at t=9, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, I'm on y=7.\n\nCheck collision at t=10 on y=7.\n\ndt = t - 9 =1 for t=10.\n\nFreeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst car span: [25 + 12*1, 36 + 12*1] = [37,48]\n\n0 not in [37,48]\n\nSecond car: [-23 + 12*1, -12 + 12*1] = [-11, 0]\n\n[-11, 0], 0 is included? Since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\n[ -11, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nSo at t=10, on y=7, second car has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so collision if I am on y=7 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, if I go to y=7 at t=10, I collide.\n\ny_{10} =7, and at turn t=10, I am on y=7, and 0 is in span, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go up at t=9 to be on y=7 at t=10.\n\nIf I stay at t=9, y_{10}=6, then at t=10, I am on y=6.\n\nCheck y=6 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 6: cars at t=9: first car: (-28,-39,right,4) so τ=-39, h=-28\n\nSpan at T: [ -39 + 4*(T-9), -28 + 4*(T-9) ]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,4) τ=37, h=48, span [37 + 4*(T-9), 48 + 4*(T-9)]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,4) τ=1, h=12, span [1 + 4*(T-9), 12 + 4*(T-9)]\n\nAt t=10, dt=1\n\nFirst span: [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond: [37+4, 48+4] = [41,52] no\n\nThird: [1+4, 12+4] = [5,16] no, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=10, on y=6 is safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, if I go down to y=5 at t=10, but y=5 is freeway 5, which has a car.\n\nFreeway 5: at t=9, (-28,-39,right,4) so τ=-39, h=-28, span [-39,-28] at t=9.\n\nAt t=10, dt=1, span [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe. But going down might not help.\n\nI need to go to y=7 at some point.\n\ny=7 is dangerous at t=10.\n\nWhen is y=7 safe?\n\nFreeway 7: cars:\n\nFirst car: τ=25, h=36, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 12dt, 36 + 12dt] where dt=T-9\n\nSecond car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [-23 + 12dt, -12 + 12dt]\n\nCollision if 0 in first span or second span.\n\nFirst span: 0 in [25+12dt, 36+12dt] ? Since 25+12dt >=25>0, and increasing, so 0 < 25+12dt always for dt>=0, so never in first span.\n\nSecond span: 0 in [-23+12dt, -12+12dt]\n\nSet -23 +12dt <= 0 <= -12 +12dt\n\nSo -23 +12dt <= 0 => 12dt <=23 => dt <= 23/12 = 1.916, so dt <=1 since dt integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +12dt => 12dt >=12 => dt >=1\n\nSo for dt=1, 0 <= -12+12=0, and -23+12=-11 <=0, so 0 is in [-11,0] at dt=1.\n\nFor dt=0, at t=9, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ndt=2, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at dt=1, t=10, collision on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, no collision on y=7 except t=10.\n\nt=10 is turn 10, dt=1.\n\nNow, what about y=8?\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: cars (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSpans identical to y=7.\n\nSo y=8 also has collision only at t=10, dt=1.\n\nNow, y=6: freeway 6.\n\nCars:\n\nFirst: τ=-39, h=-28, s=4, right, span [-39 +4dt, -28 +4dt]\n\nSecond: τ=37, h=48, s=4, span [37+4dt, 48+4dt]\n\nThird: τ=1, h=12, s=4, span [1+4dt, 12+4dt]\n\nCollision if 0 in any span.\n\nFirst span: [-39+4dt, -28+4dt], min -39, max increasing, 0 in when -39+4dt <=0 and 0<= -28+4dt\n\n-39+4dt <=0 => 4dt<=39 => dt<=39/4=9.75, so dt<=9\n\n0<= -28+4dt => 4dt>=28 => dt>=7\n\nSo for dt from 7 to 9 inclusive, 0 in first span? Let's see:\n\nAt dt=7, span [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=8, [-39+32, -28+32] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\ndt=9, [-39+36, -28+36] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\ndt=10, [-35, -24]? Earlier at dt=1, [-35,-24], not.\n\nAt dt=10, [-39+40, -28+40] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on y=6 when dt=7,8,9 i.e. turns t=16,17,18? t=9+dt.\n\ndt=7: t=16\n\ndt=8: t=17\n\ndt=9: t=18\n\nNow second span: [37+4dt,48+4dt], all positive and increasing, min 37>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird span: [1+4dt,12+4dt], min 1>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo on y=6, collision only at t=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have issues.\n\nBut I need to go through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe except at t=10.\n\nt=10 is turn 10.\n\nNow, player at t=9, y=6.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some turn not equal to 10, to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach, safe.\n\nNow, minimal turns.\n\nSince I need to go up twice: from 6 to 7, then 7 to 8, then 8 to 9, but I might stay or move directly.\n\nBut each move up changes y.\n\nI can go up at different times.\n\nStart at t=9, y=6.\n\nOption 1: stay at t=9, so a_9=S, then y_{10}=6.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=6, which is safe as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at t=10, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U at t=10, then y_{11}=7.\n\nAt t=11, I am on y=7.\n\nNow t=11, dt=2 for t=9? t=11 is turn 11, dt from t_1=9, dt=2.\n\ny=7 at t=11, dt=2.\n\nFreeway 7, second car span: [-23 +12*2, -12 +12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in. First car [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no. So safe.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=7, I can go U to y=8 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, on y=8, dt=3.\n\ny=8 same as y=7, span: second car [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24]? dt=3, -23+12*3= -23+36=13, -12+36=24, [13,24], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen at t=12, go U to y=9 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at turn 13.\n\nNow, sequence: t=9 to t=13, but actions from t=9 to t=12.\n\nStart turn t=9.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=6.\n\nI choose action for this turn, which affects y_{10}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe turn indices.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, collision based on y_{t+1}? No.\n\nAt turn t, collision based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nThen after action, y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nWe need to reach a turn where y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions to achieve that.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nThe position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1? The sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then y_{t_1 +1} should be 9.\n\nBut here from y=6, cannot in one action.\n\nIn general, after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with the sequence I thought:\n\nAt t=9, start y=6.\n\nIf I do S at t=9, then y_{10} =6.\n\nAt t=10, y=6, I do U, then y_{11}=7.\n\nAt t=11, y=7, I do U, then y_{12}=8.\n\nAt t=12, y=8, I do U, then y_{13}=9.\n\nSo at turn 13, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions: actions at t=9,10,11,12, so H=4 actions.\n\nt from t_1=9 to t_1 + H -1 =9+4-1=12, actions a9 to a12, and y_{13}=9.\n\nNow, is this minimal?\n\nH=4, but can I do in H=3?\n\nWith H=3 actions, I need y_{12}=9.\n\nStart at t=9, y=6.\n\nAfter three actions, y_{12} should be 9.\n\nSo net change +3, so I need three U moves, no S or D, because D would require more U.\n\nIf I do U,U,U, then y_{10}=7, y_{11}=8, y_{12}=9.\n\nBut at t=10, when I go to y=7, we have collision as before.\n\nSpecifically, if a9=U, then y_{10}=7, and at turn t=10, I am on y=7, which has collision at t=10.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf I do S at t=9, then U at t=10, U at t=11, then y_{10}=6 (after S), y_{11}=7 (after U at t=10), y_{12}=8 (after U at t=11), but I need y_{12}=9, so not yet at 9.\n\nAfter three actions: start y9=6.\n\na9: if S, y10=6\n\na10: if U, y11=7\n\na11: if U, y12=8\n\ny12=8, not 9. Need one more U to get to 9.\n\nIf a9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nBut at t=10, on y=7, collision.\n\nIf I go U at t=9 to y=7 at t=10, collision.\n\nNo other way with three actions: to go from 6 to 9 in three steps, I must increase y by 3, so three U actions, no S or D, so I must be on y=7 at t=10, which causes collision.\n\nTherefore, H=3 impossible.\n\nH=4 is possible as I described.\n\nBut in my sequence, I used S at t=9, then U,U,U.\n\nBut I can go directly at later time.\n\nBut H=4 seems minimal.\n\nIn my sequence: actions: t=9: S, t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U\n\nThen y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, y13=9.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nAt t=11, on y=7, with dt=2 (since t=11, from t9, dt=2), y=7 safe as we saw.\n\nSimilarly t=12, y=8 safe.\n\nt=13, y=9 safe.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=6 longer, but that would take more turns.\n\nOr go down, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother idea: what about y=8? Similarly, y=8 has the same issue at t=10.\n\nBut in the path, I need to go through y=7 or y=8 at times not t=10.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=7 at t=11, which is fine.\n\nI could go to y=8 directly, but from y=6, I need to go to y=7 first? No, I can go from y=6 to y=7 to y=8, etc.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are both problematic only at t=10.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? For example, if I go to y=5, but y=5 might have issues.\n\nBut I don't need to.\n\nIn this case, with H=4, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on other freeways, but since I only care about the freeways I am on.\n\nIn this sequence, I am on y=6 at t=9 and t=10, both safe since t=10 dt=1, y=6, spans: first car [-39+4, -28+4]=[-35,-24] no, second [41,52] no, third [5,16] no, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=7, dt=2, span [1,12] and [49,60], no 0.\n\nSimilarly t=12, y=8, similar.\n\nt=13, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, but the player is at (0,y), and cars, but the x-position is always 0 for player, and cars move, but collision only if 0 in span at that turn for the y.\n\nIn freeway 6, at t=10, we have no collision, but later at t=16,17,18 there is, but I am not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut I should check if there are obstacles on the way, but in this path, it seems clear.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by going up earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I go U at t=9 to y=7, but at t=10, collision, not possible.\n\nIf I stay at t=9, S, then at t=10, instead of U, I could do something else, but that might delay.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I could go S or D, but then I need to go up later.\n\nBut that would take more actions, H larger.\n\nFor instance, if at t=10, I stay S, y11=6, then I need to go up later.\n\nBut at t=11, dt=2, y=6, is it safe? At t=11, dt=2, freeway 6 first car span [-39+8, -28+8]=[-31,-20] no 0, safe.\n\nBut if I stay, I waste time.\n\nThen go U at t=11 to y=7 at t=12? y12=7.\n\nThen at t=12, on y=7, dt=3, span [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24]? Earlier for y=7 at dt=3: second car [-23+12*3, -12+12*3]=[-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24], no 0.\n\nThen go U to y=8 at t=13, then U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut that would be more actions: say a9=S, a10=S, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, then y14=9, H=5 actions, worse than H=4.\n\nSo not better.\n\nGo down to y=5? At t=9, if D, y10=5.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: at t=9, car (-28,-39,right,4) so τ=-39,h=-28, span [-39,-28] at t=9.\n\nAt t=10, dt=1, span [-39+4, -28+4]=[-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=6 at t=11, etc., but again, more steps.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the H=4 sequence seems best.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a9=S, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U.\n\nThen y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, y13=9.\n\nNow, but at t=11, when I am on y=7, is there any issue?\n\nt=11, turn 11, from t9, dt=2.\n\ny=7, freeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [25+24,36+24]=[49,60]\n\nSecond: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12]\n\n0 not in, good.\n\nSimilarly, when I go to y=8 at t=12, dt=3.\n\ny=8 same: first car [25+36,36+36]=[61,72]? dt=3, 25+36=61,36+36=72.\n\nSecond: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24], no 0.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, but what about freeway 4 or others? But I am not on them, so no need.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I go to a different y, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay on a freeway, but in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going through a different path, but all paths must go through y=7 or y=8, and since y=7 and y=8 are safe except at t=10, and I avoid t=10.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=7 at t=11.\n\nCould I go to y=8 directly? From y=6, if I go U, to y=7, cannot directly to y=8.\n\nUnless I do multiple actions, but each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo must go through y=7.\n\ny=7 is necessary to reach y=8 and y=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=4 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from turn 9 to turn 12.\n\na_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}\n\nIn the sequence: a_{t_1} = a_9, a_{t_1+1}=a_{10}, etc.\n\nWith a9=S, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} , which is turn 9: S\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} , turn 10: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} , turn 11: U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} , turn 12: U\n\nH=4.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is a9 to a12.\n\nAnd after that, y_{13}=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there another sequence with same H?\n\nFor example, at t=9, I could do U, but that causes collision at t=10.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, at t=9, S; t=10, U to y=7 at t=11? At t=10, if I do U, y11=7.\n\nThen at t=11, I am on y=7.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nAt t=11, on y=7, I can do U to y=8 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, on y=8, do U to y=9 at t=13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=11, I do something else, but not necessary.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, at t=9, I did S, but could I do nothing? S is stay.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later, but same.\n\nAnother point: what about freeway 2 or others? But since I don't go there, no issue.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 has a car at t=9: (0,-47,right,48), so h=0, τ=-47, span [ -47, 0 ] at t=9, which includes 0.\n\nBut freeway 2 is y=2, and I am at y=6, not on it.\n\nAt future turns, but I am not on y=2, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 has a car with span [1,12] at t=9, which includes 0? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\nAt t=9, third car [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nLater, but I don't care.\n\nSo only the freeways I traverse matter.\n\nIn this case, I traverse y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6: safe at t=9 and t=10 in my sequence.\n\ny=7: safe at t=11.\n\ny=8: safe at t=12.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 in fewer by waiting less, but not possible.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at turn 13.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nH=4, sequence: turn 9: S, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U.\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, there is freeway 3, for example, but I don't go there.\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, car (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nd=left, so at t=9, span [h,τ] = [-24,-1]\n\nThen at T, [ -24 -24*(T-9), -1 -24*(T-9) ] since left-moving.\n\nFor example, at t=10, dt=1, [ -24-24, -1-24] = [-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Collision Conditions**:\n  - Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n  - The car spans evolve linearly over time based on their direction and speed, starting from turn \\(t_1 = 9\\).\n- **Critical Freeways**:\n  - To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 6\\), the player must pass through \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have identical car configurations: cars with spans \\([25, 36]\\) and \\([-23, -12]\\) at turn 9, both right-moving with speed 12.\n    - Collision occurs on both freeways only at turn \\(T = 10\\) (i.e., when \\(T - 9 = 1\\)), as the second car's span is \\([-11, 0]\\), which includes 0.\n    - At other turns, these freeways are safe.\n  - Freeway \\(y = 6\\) has cars with spans \\([-39, -28]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), and \\([1, 12]\\) at turn 9, all right-moving with speed 4.\n    - Collision occurs on \\(y = 6\\) at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (when \\(T - 9 = 7, 8, 9\\)), but not at turns \\(T = 9\\) or \\(T = 10\\).\n- **Reachability**:\n  - The minimum number of actions to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3 (three \"U\" actions), but this requires being on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10, where collision occurs. Thus, \\(H = 3\\) is impossible.\n  - \\(H = 4\\) is achievable by avoiding \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10. Specifically:\n    - Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 9 (action \"S\") to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10.\n    - At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (action \"U\"), arriving at turn 11. Turn 11 is safe for \\(y = 7\\) (span \\([1, 12]\\), no 0).\n    - At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (action \"U\"), arriving at turn 12. Turn 12 is safe for \\(y = 8\\) (span \\([13, 24]\\), no 0).\n    - At turn 12, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (action \"U\"), arriving at turn 13. \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, so it is safe.\n  - This sequence uses \\(H = 4\\) actions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- Turn 9: Action \"S\" (stay at \\(y = 6\\), safe as no collision on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9).\n- Turn 10: Action \"U\" (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 11; at turn 10, player is on \\(y = 6\\), safe).\n- Turn 11: Action \"U\" (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 12; at turn 11, player is on \\(y = 7\\), safe as span is \\([1, 12]\\)).\n- Turn 12: Action \"U\" (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13; at turn 12, player is on \\(y = 8\\), safe as span is \\([13, 24]\\)).\n\nAfter 4 actions, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 13. No sequence with \\(H < 4\\) is possible due to the collision at turn 10 on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 10, and I start at y=6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each car, given its position at turn t_1=10, I can find where it will be at any future turn T.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI start at y=6 at turn 10.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I'm going up, and 9 is above 6, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so when I'm on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. But I start at y=6, which is a freeway, and I need to get to y=9, which is safe.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, so once I'm there, I'm fine.\n\nBut to get there, I have to pass through y=7 and y=8, which have cars.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=10.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to understand the span.\n\nFor left-moving cars: direction left, so head and tail: I think head is the front, but in the update, for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in the span at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end? Let me see.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo, in both cases, at t_1, [min, max] is given, but for left, [h, τ] might not be min to max; it says [h, τ], and h and τ could be such that h > τ or h < τ? I think we need to interpret the span properly.\n\nLook at the examples.\n\nFor instance, freeway 1: cars (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for first car, τ=37, h=48, so [37,48] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car, τ=-11, h=0, so [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nThen at time T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)] for first car, and [-11 + 12(T-10), 0 + 12(T-10)] for second car.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, 0 is in some car's span at that T.\n\nAnd I'm on freeway y at turn T if that's my position after the action, but the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or after move? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at the end of turn t, I'm at y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is my position at turn T, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is my vertical position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I am on freeway y_T.\n\nThen for that freeway, if there is a car such that at turn T, 0 is in its span, then collision.\n\nAlso, the note: if at turn T, I move to a different y, say from y to y', then at turn T, I am still on y, not on y', so collision only depends on cars on y at turn T, not on y'.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I am on y' for collision check.\n\nNow, in this case, I start at turn t_1=10, position (0,6), so at turn 10, I am on freeway 6.\n\nThen I take action a_10, which determines y_11, and so on.\n\nI need to find actions from a_10 to a_{10+H-1} such that after H turns, I am at y=9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = 9, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nI start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, I go to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nGenerally, after t actions, I am at turn t_1 + t, position y_{t_1 + t}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd I want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt time t_1, I am at y_{t_1} = 6.\n\nI take action a_{t_1}, which affects the move to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1}, I am at y_{t_1 +1} at time t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t_1 + t}, I am at y_{t_1 + t +1} at time t_1 + t +1.\n\nThe position at time t is y_t, after the action of previous turn.\n\nAt time t_1, before any action, I am at (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1}, and move to y_{t_1 +1} at time t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, at time t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, take action a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2} at time t_1 +2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the task says: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, because from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 +1} after a_{t_1}, to y_{t_1 +2} after a_{t_1 +1}, ..., to y_{t_1 + H} after a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H} is the position after H actions.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThat would be before the last action or something.\n\nI think there's a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me denote the state at time t.\n\nAt time t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nThen at time t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at time t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so a_t for t = t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H - 1}, I am at y_{t_1 + H} at time t_1 + H.\n\nAnd I want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the task says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which is the position at time t_1 + H - 1, before taking action a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, then at time t_1 + H - 1, I am already at 9, so I don't need to take action to go to 9; I am there.\n\nBut if I am at 9 at time t_1 + H - 1, and I take an action, I might move away, but I can choose S to stay.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9), so once I am at y=9, I am done, I don't need to move, but the sequence includes the actions until I reach.\n\nLet's read the task:\n\n\"minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the sequence is actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which are taken at times t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAt time t_1 + H - 1, after taking a_{t_1 + H - 1}, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the position at time t_1 + H - 1 is y_{t_1 + H - 1}, before taking action a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, then at time t_1 + H - 1, I am at 9, so to reach at that time, I don't take an action at that time to arrive; I am already there.\n\nThe sequence includes actions up to the turn before I am at 9 or something.\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the position y_t is defined at integer times, and actions are taken at each time.\n\nTo have y_t = 9 at some time t, with t = t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThen H is the number of actions to be taken from time t_1 to t-1, so that at time t, I am at 9.\n\nFor example, at time t_1, I am at y_{t_1} = 6.\n\nIf I take no actions, I am still at 6 at time t_1, but I need to move to 9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, I am at time t_1, y=6, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action, at time t_1 +1, y could be 5,6,7.\n\nI need y_t = 9 for some t >= t_1.\n\nLet t = t_1 + K, so at time t_1 + K, y_{t_1 + K} = 9.\n\nThen I need to take K actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + K - 1}, so H = K actions.\n\nThen the position at time t_1 + K is after K actions.\n\nThe task says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, so if we let T = t_1 + H - 1, then at time T, y_T = 9.\n\nAnd I have taken actions from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}, so H-1 actions? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nThe last action is at time t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H-1}, I am at y_{t_1 + H} at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut the task wants y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which is the position at time t_1 + H-1, before taking the action at that time.\n\nIf at time t_1 + H-1, I am at y=9, then I don't need to take an action at that time to be at 9; I am already there.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H-1}, which is the action taken at time t_1 + H-1 to go to the next position.\n\nIf I am at 9 at time t_1 + H-1, I can choose a_{t_1 + H-1} = S to stay at 9, but then at time t_1 + H, I am still at 9.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9), so at time t_1 + H-1, I am at 9, so I have reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is to be taken until I reach, including the action to stay or something.\n\nI think it's a bit messy, but from the answer format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\", and after that, at time t_1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which contradicts.\n\nLet's read the task again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means that at time t_1 + H - 1, the position is 9.\n\nThen the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, taken at times t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAt time t_1 + H-1, I take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut if y_{t_1 + H-1} = 9, that is before taking the action at time t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for the position to be 9 at time t_1 + H-1, I must have arrived there by the action at time t_1 + H-2 or earlier.\n\nThe actions up to a_{t_1 + H-2} bring me to y_{t_1 + H-1} = 9 at time t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen at time t_1 + H-1, I take action a_{t_1 + H-1}, but since I am already at 9, I might choose S, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nBut the goal is reached at time t_1 + H-1 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t_1 + H-1} is included, which is the action at the time I am at 9.\n\nBut I can choose to stay or move, but since I want to be at 9, I should stay or something.\n\nTo minimize H, I think H is the number of actions, and I need to reach at time t_1 + H-1.\n\nFor example, if I start at time t_1 at y=6, and I go directly up, I can reach y=9 in 3 moves: a10=U, to y11=7; a11=U, to y12=8; a12=U, to y13=9. So at time 13, y=9. So I took actions at t=10,11,12, H=3 actions, and y_{t1 + H} = y13=9, but the task says y_{t1 + H -1} = y12 should be 9? No, y12=8 in this case.\n\nIf I want y_{t1 + H-1} =9, with H actions.\n\nSet T = t1 + H-1, y_T =9.\n\nThen at time T, I am at 9.\n\nThe actions are from a_t1 to a_{T}, because t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_t1 to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_T.\n\nSo at time T, I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at time T, before action, I am at y_T=9.\n\nThen I take action a_T, which could keep me at 9 or move away.\n\nBut the position at time T is 9, so I have reached at time T.\n\nThe action a_T is taken at time T, but it doesn't change the position at time T; it changes the future position.\n\nSo for the purpose of reaching (0,9) at time T, the actions before that are what matter, and a_T is not necessary, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, when I am at 9 at time T, I can choose a_T = S to stay, or U or D, but since I want to be at 9, S is fine.\n\nBut to minimize H, I need the smallest H such that for some sequence, y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nWith H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at time t1 + H-1.\n\nFrom start at time t1, y=6, the earliest I can be at y=9 is at time t1+3, with y_{t1+3}=9.\n\nAt time t1+3, y=9.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+3}, so t1 + H-1 = t1+3, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nActions: a_t1 to a_{t1+3}, but at time t1+3, I take a_{t1+3}, which affects y_{t1+4}, but at time t1+3, before action, I am at y_{t1+3}=9.\n\nSo the actions to get there are a_t1, a_t1+1, a_t1+2.\n\nThen at time t1+3, I am at 9, and I take a_t1+3, which is part of the sequence but not needed for reaching.\n\nBut the sequence includes it.\n\nIn this case, with H=4, y_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+3} =9.\n\nIf I reach at t1+3 with H=3 actions, y_{t1+3} =9, but y_{t1 + H-1} = y_{t1+2} if H=3, which is not 9.\n\nSo for H=3, y_{t1+2} is not 9, it's 8 or something.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 at time T= t1+3, I need H such that t1 + H-1 = T, so H-1 = T - t1, H = (T - t1) +1.\n\nFor T= t1+3, H=4.\n\nWith 3 actions, I can be at y=9 at time t1+3, but the position at time t1+2 is not 9.\n\nThe task requires y_{t1 + H-1} =9, so for reaching at time T, H = (T - t1) +1.\n\nThe minimal T is what we care about, but H will be T - t1 +1.\n\nMin H means min T, since t1 fixed.\n\nSo essentially, find the minimal time T >= t1 such that I can be at y=9 at time T, with no collision at times from t1 to T-1, I think, but collision at each time when I am on a freeway.\n\nFrom time t1 to T, at each time, when I am on a freeway, I must not collide.\n\nAt time T, if y_T=9, no freeway, no collision possible.\n\nSo for times from t1 to T-1, when y_t between 1 and 8, I must avoid collision at that time.\n\nNow in this case, t1=10, y10=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way is to go up: U,U,U to reach y=9 at time 13.\n\nBut I have to check for each freeway I am on, at each time, whether there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nI start at time 10, y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nAt time 10, for freeway 6, are there cars with 0 in span?\n\nFreeway 6 cars: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for t1=10.\n\nt1=10, so at time T, span = [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\n\nFor car 1: τ=-35, h=-24? No.\n\nThe cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since right-moving, τ < h.\n\nIn the list, for freeway 6: (-24,-35,right,4), so head = -24, tail = -35? That seems odd, because usually head is front.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t1=10.\n\nSimilarly, (52,41,right,4), τ=41, h=52? [41,52]\n\nAnd (16,5,right,4), [5,16]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + 4(T-10), h + 4(T-10)]\n\nSo for car1: τ=-35, h=-24, span at T: [-35 +4(T-10), -24 +4(T-10)] = [-35 +4T-40, -24 +4T-40] = [4T-75, 4T-64]\n\nSimilarly, car2: τ=41, h=52, span [41 +4(T-10), 52 +4(T-10)] = [41+4T-40, 52+4T-40] = [4T+1, 4T+12]\n\nCar3: τ=5, h=16, span [5 +4(T-10), 16 +4(T-10)] = [5+4T-40, 16+4T-40] = [4T-35, 4T-24]\n\nNow at time T, collision if 0 is in one of these intervals for freeway 6.\n\nBut at time T, for the position at that time.\n\nAt time 10, T=10, y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nCheck if 0 in any span at T=10.\n\nFor car1: [4*10-75, 4*10-64] = [40-75,40-64] = [-35,-24], 0 not in [-35,-24]\n\nCar2: [40+1,40+12]=[41,52], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [40-35,40-24]=[5,16], 0 not in\n\nSo at time 10, no collision.\n\nNow, I take action a10, which determines y11.\n\nIf I go up, a10=U, then y11=7.\n\nAt time 11, I am on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 cars: (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ +12(T-10), h +12(T-10)]\n\nFirst car: τ=37, h=48, span [37 +12(T-10), 48 +12(T-10)] = [12T -120 +37, 12T-120+48] = [12T -83, 12T -72]\n\nAt T=11: [12*11 -83, 12*11 -72] = [132-83,132-72] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ=-11, h=0, span [-11 +12(T-10), 0 +12(T-10)] = [12T -120 -11, 12T-120] = [12T-131, 12T-120]\n\nAt T=11: [12*11-131, 12*11-120] = [132-131,132-120] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSo at time 11, on freeway 7, no collision.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=8, at time 12 on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: same as freeway 7? (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: as above.\n\nAt T=12: first car [12*12 -83, 12*12 -72] = [144-83,144-72] = [61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [12*12-131, 12*12-120] = [144-131,144-120] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=9, at time 13, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reached in 3 moves, at time 13.\n\nBut according to the task, to have y_{t1 + H-1} = y_{10 + H-1} =9.\n\nAt time 13, y13=9, so t1 + H-1 =13, 10 + H-1=13, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThen the sequence should have 4 actions: a10, a11, a12, a13.\n\nBut at time 13, I am at y13=9, and I take a13, which could be S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify a10 to a13.\n\nBut with a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S, for example.\n\nBut I reached at time 13 with the actions.\n\nIn terms of time, I am at y=9 at time 13.\n\nWith H=4, y_{t1+H-1}=y13=9.\n\nIf I could reach earlier, but from y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 steps up, so time 13 is earliest possible.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point there is collision in this path.\n\nIn the above, at time 10,11,12, no collision, as I checked.\n\nBut is that true for all?\n\nAt time 10, freeway 6, cars spans: car1 [4T-75,4T-64] at T=10: [40-75,40-64]=[-35,-24], not 0.\n\nCar2 [4T+1,4T+12] at T=10: [41,52], not 0.\n\nCar3 [4T-35,4T-24] at T=10: [5,16], not 0.\n\nAt time 11, freeway 7, T=11:\n\nFirst car [12T-83,12T-72] = [132-83,132-72]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nSecond car [12T-131,12T-120]=[132-131,132-120]=[1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nAt time 12, freeway 8, T=12:\n\nFirst car [12*12-83,144-72]=[61,72], no.\n\nSecond car [144-131,144-120]=[13,24], no.\n\nSo no collision, and I can reach at time 13 with actions U,U,U and then S at time 13, but a13 is at time 13, after which y14=9 or something, but position at time 13 is already 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=4, actions a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S.\n\nBut a13=S keeps me at 9.\n\nSince I am at 9 at time 13, I don't need to take action, but the sequence includes it.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=3 with y_{t1+H-1}=y_{12}=9? But y12=8 if I go up, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at time 12, I need to have moved faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so impossible to be at 9 before time 13.\n\nAt time t1=10, y=6; after one action, at time 11, y=5,6,7; after two actions, time 12, y=4 to 8; after three actions, time 13, y=3 to 9. So earliest at time 13, y=9.\n\nSo minimal T=13.\n\nThus H=4 with y_{10+4-1}=y13=9.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that there are no collisions at times 10,11,12.\n\nI think I checked, but let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on other freeways don't matter, only the one I am on at that time.\n\nBut in this path, I am only on y=6,7,8 at times 10,11,12.\n\ny=6 at time 10, y=7 at time 11, y=8 at time 12.\n\nNow, but I need to check for all times when I am on freeway.\n\nBut is there a possibility that at some other time, if I go slower, but since I can go fast, and no collision, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me check if on freeway 8, for example, at time 12, is there a car covering 0?\n\nAs above, no.\n\nBut let me see the second car on freeway 7 and 8: (0,-11,right,12) at t1=10, span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nAt T, [ -11 +12(T-10), 0 +12(T-10) ] = [12T -120 -11, 12T-120] = [12T-131, 12T-120]\n\nAt T=11: [132-131,132-120]=[1,12], not 0.\n\nAt T=12: [144-131,144-120]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nWhen does it cover 0? Set 12T-131 <= 0 <= 12T-120\n\nSo 12T-131 <=0 and 0<=12T-120\n\nSo 12T <=131, T<=131/12=10.916, so T<=10 since integer? T=10: 12*10-131=120-131=-11<=0, and 0<=120-120=0, so at T=10, 0 is included, because [12*10-131,12*10-120]=[-11,0], and 0 is included.\n\nBut at time T=10, for freeway 7, I am not on freeway 7 at time 10; I am on freeway 6 at time 10.\n\nAt time 11, I am on freeway 7, and at T=11, the span is [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn my path, no issue.\n\nBut let me check if there is a car that might cause problem at some point.\n\nFor example, on freeway 4, there is a car (-12,-23,right,12), but I am not on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo direct path seems fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), and cars are on x-axis, moving.\n\nIn the collision, it is only when I am at x=0 and y=k, and 0 in car span on that freeway.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 7 at time 10, there is a car with span [-11,0] at T=10, which includes 0, so if I were on freeway 7 at time 10, I would collide, but I am on freeway 6, not 7.\n\nAt time 11, on freeway 7, the car has moved, span [1,12], not including 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with actions: a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, and since H=4, I need a13.\n\nAt time 13, I am at y=9, so I can do a13=S.\n\nThen sequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: U, Turn 12: U, Turn 13: S.\n\nBut is S necessary? Since I am at 9, and I need to reach, but the action at time 13 is taken, but it doesn't affect reaching, but to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can have only three actions, but with H=3, y_{t1+H-1}=y_{10+3-1}=y12, which should be 9, but with three actions, from y10=6, after a10, a11, a12, y13= something, but y12 is after two actions? Let's not confuse.\n\nAt time 10: y10=6\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAt time 11: y11\n\nAfter a11, y12\n\nAt time 12: y12\n\nAfter a12, y13\n\nIf I take actions a10, a11, a12, that's three actions, H=3, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{10+3-1} = y12.\n\nI need y12=9.\n\nBut from y10=6, to have y12=9, I need to go up twice, but y12 would be 8 if I go U,U, since y11=7, y12=8.\n\nTo have y12=9, I need to go U at a10 and a11, then y11=7, y12=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a12, y13=9.\n\nBut y12=8.\n\nSo y12 cannot be 9 with start from y10=6 in two moves.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9 is at time 13 with y13=9.\n\nThus for y_{t1+H-1}=y13=9, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nSo I need four actions.\n\nBut the fourth action at time 13 is after I have reached, so I can choose S.\n\nIn the sequence, it must be included.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can write the actions to move and then stay.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut I think I should verify if at time 12 on freeway 8, it is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 cars same as freeway 7: (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt time 12, T=12.\n\nFirst car: [12*12 -83, 12*12 -72] = [144-83,144-72]=[61,72]? Earlier calculation.\n\nFrom above: span at T: [12T-83,12T-72] for first car? For τ=37,h=48, [37+12(T-10),48+12(T-10)] = [12T -120+37, 12T-120+48] = [12T-83,12T-72]\n\nAt T=12: [144-83,144-72]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [12T-131,12T-120] at T=12: [144-131,144-120]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nBut is there any car that might be at 0 at some other time?\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, car (0,-11,right,12) at T=10, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other places.\n\nSo direct path should work.\n\nBut let me see the cars on freeway 4, for example, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if going up immediately causes collision, but in this case, no.\n\nMaybe I should list for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut since I only care about the path I take.\n\nIn this path, from time 10 to 12, on y=6,7,8, all safe.\n\nThus minimal H=4.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nFreeway 6: cars at t1=10: (-24,-35,right,4), so τ=-35, h=-24, [ -35, -24 ] at T=10? span at T=10: since t1=10, T=10, so for car, [τ + s(10-10), h + s(10-10)] = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] for this car? head and tail.\n\nIn the input, (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nAt T, [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] = [-35 +4(T-10), -24 +4(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, (52,41,right,4), τ=41, h=52, [41,52] at T=10.\n\n(16,5,right,4), [5,16] at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, on freeway 6, spans [-35,-24], [41,52], [5,16], none contain 0.\n\nAt T=11, for freeway 7, but freeway 7 is different.\n\nI think I am fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car list, there is freeway 2, for example, (48,1,right,48), which at T=10, span [1,48], not 0, but at T=11, [1+48(1),48+48(1)]? s=48, t1=10.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] = [1 +48(T-10), 48 +48(T-10)] for this car.\n\nAt T=10: [1,48]\n\nAt T=11: [1+48,48+48]=[49,96], etc.\n\n0 never covered since min is 1.\n\nSimilarly, other cars might cover 0 at some times.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (0,-11,right,12), at T=10, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nBut if I were on freeway 1 at time 10, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: cars (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ +12(T-10), h +12(T-10)]\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59 +12(T-10), -48 +12(T-10)] = [12T-120-59,12T-120-48]=[12T-179,12T-168]\n\nAt T=10: [-59,-48], not 0.\n\nSecond car: τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23+12(T-10), -12+12(T-10)] = [12T-120-23,12T-120-12]=[12T-143,12T-132]\n\nAt T=10: [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nThird car: τ=13, h=24, [13+12(T-10),24+12(T-10)] = [12T-120+13,12T-120+24]=[12T-107,12T-96]\n\nAt T=10: [13,24], not 0.\n\nWhen does second car cover 0? Set 12T-143 <=0 <=12T-132\n\nSo 12T-143 <=0 => T<=143/12=11.916, T<=11\n\nAnd 0<=12T-132 => 12T>=132, T>=11\n\nSo at T=11, 12*11-143=132-143=-11<=0, 0<=132-132=0? 12T-132 at T=11: 132-132=0, so 0 <=0 true, so 0 in [ -11, 0 ] at T=11? Span at T=11: [12*11-143,12*11-132]=[132-143,132-132]=[-11,0], so yes, 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, on freeway 4, if I am there, collision.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut for my path, all safe.\n\nSo I think I can go directly.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster, but I cannot, since 3 steps needed.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 in fewer actions by being there earlier, but impossible.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: U, Turn 12: U, Turn 13: S\n\nBut for Turn 13, since I am at y=9, and I need to be there, S is fine.\n\nI could do nothing, but action must be specified.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collisions.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at time 12.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: same as 7: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt T=12, first car span [12*12-83,12*12-72]=[144-83,144-72]=[61,72]\n\nSecond car [12*12-131,12*12-120]=[144-131,144-120]=[13,24]\n\n0 not in.\n\nAt time 13, I am at y=9, no car.\n\nBut in the sequence, a13 is at time 13, action for that turn.\n\nSince I am at 9, I can choose any, but S to stay.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to specify beyond, but H=4 includes it.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay, but going up is fastest.\n\nSuppose at some point I need to wait because of car, but in this case, no need.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7 at time 11, the second car has span [1,12], which is close to 0, but not including.\n\nIf I were to be on freeway 7 at time 10, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think H=4 with actions U,U,U,S.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut the turns are labeled from t1=10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is S necessary? Since at time 13, I am already at 9, and taking S keeps it, but if I take U, y14=10, but y must be in [0,9], so U not allowed, since y=9, U would go to 10, invalid, so only S or D, but D goes down, which is not desired, so S is best.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 3, but with y12=9, which is impossible.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 5, for example, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,6), and at time 10, I am on y=6, which I checked safe.\n\nThen I move up.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at time 12 on y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 4, as it takes 3 turns to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) (since each \"up\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1), and an additional turn to account for the requirement that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\), which occurs at turn 13. The sequence of actions must ensure no collision occurs at any turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)).\n\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). The cars on freeway 6 at turn 10 have spans that do not include 0:  \n  - Car 1: \\([-35, -24]\\)  \n  - Car 2: \\([41, 52]\\)  \n  - Car 3: \\([5, 16]\\)  \n  No collision occurs, so moving up (\\(U\\)) is safe, leading to \\(y_{11} = 7\\).\n\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). The cars on freeway 7 at turn 11 have spans that do not include 0:  \n  - Car 1: \\([49, 60]\\)  \n  - Car 2: \\([1, 12]\\) (0 is not in \\([1, 12]\\) since \\(0 < 1\\))  \n  No collision occurs, so moving up (\\(U\\)) is safe, leading to \\(y_{12} = 8\\).\n\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 12 have spans that do not include 0:  \n  - Car 1: \\([61, 72]\\)  \n  - Car 2: \\([13, 24]\\)  \n  No collision occurs, so moving up (\\(U\\)) is safe, leading to \\(y_{13} = 9\\).\n\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision is possible. The action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying \\(y_{13} = 9\\).\n\nThus, the sequence of actions for turns 10 to 13 achieves the goal with \\(H = 4\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, S \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 11.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if at turn T, you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8.

I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are freeways, so I need to be careful when I'm on them.\n\ny=9 is the target, so once I'm there, I'm done.\n\nBut I need to minimize the number of turns, so I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn 11 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h], so for first car: head h=60, tail τ=49? That doesn't make sense because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, d=right, so span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, d=left, span is [h, τ] with h ≤ τ.\n\nIn freeway 1, both cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12. So span at turn 11 is [49, 60]\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with t1=11.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t) at each turn.\n\nSo for a given freeway y and turn T, if y_t = y, and for some car on y, 0 is in its span at T, then collision.\n\nNow for freeway 1 at turn 11:\n\nCar 1: span [49,60] at T=11, s=12, right.\n\nCar 2: (12,1,right,12), so span [1,12] at T=11.\n\nNow, 0 is not in [1,12] or [49,60], so at turn 11, on y=7, but freeway 1 is y=1, I think? Freeway k=1,2,3,... probably corresponds to y=k, so freeway 1 is y=1.\n\nThe freeways are labeled k=1 to 8 for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for freeway 1 (y=1): cars at T=11: spans [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in either, so safe if on y=1 at T=11.\n\nBut I'm at y=7 now.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): one car (96,49,right,48)\n\nh=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48, so span at T=11: [49,96]\n\n0 not in, so safe.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): (-72,-49,left,24)\n\nd=left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h ≤ τ.\n\nHere h=-72, τ=-49, so h < τ, so [ -72, -49 ] at T=11.\n\ns=24, left-moving, so at time T, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-72 -24(T-11), -49 -24(T-11)]\n\nBut collision only if 0 in span at T.\n\nAt T=11, span [-72,-49], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): three cars:\n\n(-36,-47,right,12), d=right, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? τ=-47, h=-36, so since d=right, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at T=11.\n\nThen (0,-11,right,12), span [-11,0]? τ=-11, h=0, so span [-11,0] at T=11.\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so span [ -11, 0 ].\n\n0 is included, since it's a closed interval? The span includes the endpoints, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is endpoint, it should be included.\n\nFor this car on y=4 at T=11: span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if player is on y=4 at T=11, collision.\n\nBut I'm not on y=4 now.\n\nThen third car: (36,25,right,12), span [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nd=right, h=-20, τ=-31, so span [τ, h] = [-31, -20] at T=11, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): three cars:\n\n(-20,-31,right,4), same as above? No, different freeway.\n\n(-20,-31,right,4), span [-31,-20] at T=11\n\n(56,45,right,4), h=56, τ=45, span [45,56]\n\n(20,9,right,4), h=20, τ=9, span [9,20]\n\n0 not in any.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), same as freeway 1.\n\nSpans [1,12] and [49,60] at T=11, 0 not in, so at turn 11, on y=7, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as freeway 1 and 7: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), spans [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut to get to y=9, I need to be at y=8 first, then move up to y=9.\n\nAt y=8, I need to avoid collisions when I'm on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, when I'm on y=7, I need to avoid collisions if I stay or move.\n\nSince I start at y=7, turn 11.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of turns should be at least 2, since I need to go up twice: from 7 to 8, then 8 to 9.\n\nBut I might need to wait if there are cars blocking.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly: at turn 11, action U, so y_{12} = 8.\n\nThen at turn 12, action U, y_{13} = 9.\n\nNow, I need to check for collisions during this sequence.\n\nAt turn 11: I am at y=7. Action U, so I move to y=8 at the next turn, but at turn 11, I am still on y=7.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 11: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nCars on y=7: at turn 11, spans [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nI take action U, so y_{12} = 8.\n\n- At turn 12: y=12, freeway 8 (since y=8).\n\nNow, I need to check cars on freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12) at t1=11.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span depends on direction.\n\nRight-moving car: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nt1=11.\n\nFor freeway 8, both cars right-moving.\n\nFirst car: τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\nAt turn T, span: [49 + 12(T-11), 60 + 12(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=1, h=12, s=12, span [1 + 12(T-11), 12 + 12(T-11)]\n\nAt turn 12, T=12.\n\nT-11=1.\n\nSo first car span: [49 + 12*1, 60 + 12*1] = [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72]\n\nSecond car span: [1 + 12*1, 12 + 12*1] = [13,24]\n\n0 is not in [13,24] nor [61,72], so no collision at turn 12 on y=8.\n\nThen I take action U at turn 12, so y_{13} = 9.\n\nAt turn 13: y=13? No, y is the position, not the turn.\n\ny_t is the vertical position at turn t.\n\nAt turn 12, y=8, I take action U, so at turn 13, y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 13, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, no collision. I have reached the goal.\n\nBut the turn when I reach y=9 is turn 13, and I started at turn 11, so H=3 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t1=11.\n\nAt turn 11: I am at (0,7), I perform action a_{11}.\n\nThen after action, at turn 12, position is (0, y_{12}).\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Turn 11: y_11 = 7, on freeway 7, no collision as above.\n\nI choose a_{11} = U, so y_{12} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n- Turn 12: y_12 = 8, on freeway 8, cars on y=8 at turn 12: spans [13,24] and [61,72], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nI choose a_{12} = U, so y_{13} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\n- Turn 13: y_13 = 9, not a freeway, no collision, done.\n\nSo I reached at turn 13, with actions at turn 11 and 12.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=11 to t=11+H-1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=11, so a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter H turns, I am at y_{t1 + H}\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe player position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t1=11, y_{11} = 7.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =9, but I start at 7, not 9.\n\nWith actions, after actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is applied from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and after that, at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of turns, from start turn t1 to end turn t1+H-1, inclusive? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after choosing a_t at turn t, I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe position changes after the action.\n\nBut collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, I think, based on current position before action? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, we have y_T, and we check if on freeway, collision with cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t1 + H -1, I am at position 9.\n\nFor that to happen, I need to have arrived there by actions up to turn t1 + H -2 or something.\n\nLet's set t_start = t1 =11.\n\nI start at turn t_start with y=7.\n\nI want after some turns, at some turn T_end, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nAnd T_end = t_start + H -1? The problem says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo T_end = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I can reach at turn 11, but y_11=7 ≠9, so not possible.\n\nMinimal H: if I go directly, as above, at turn 12, y=8, not 9; at turn 13, y=9.\n\nSo T_end=13, y_13=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =13, t1=11, so 11 + H -1 =13, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nt1 + H -1 =13, 11 + H -1 =13, so 10 + H =13? 11 + H -1 =10 + H =13, so H=3.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=3, actions at t=11,12,13? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1 + t for t=0: a_{t1} = a_11\n\nt=1: a_{12}\n\nt=2: a_{13} for H=3? t from 0 to H-1, so if H=3, t=0,1,2: actions a11, a12, a13.\n\nBut when I take a13, it affects y14.\n\nBut I need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{11+3-1} = y_{13} =9.\n\nSo at turn 13, y13=9.\n\nTo have y13=9, that means at turn 12, y12, I took action such that y13 = y12 + Δy12.\n\nIf at turn 12, y12=8, I take U, then y13=9.\n\nOr if y12=9, I take S, but I start from 7.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 11, y11=7, take U, y12=8.\n\nAt turn 12, y12=8, take U, y13=9.\n\nAt turn 13, y13=9, done. I don't need to take action at turn 13, but the action sequence is up to a_{t1+H-1}, which for H=3 would include a13.\n\nBut at turn 13, I am already at y13=9, and if I take no action or stay, but the action is chosen, and collision might be checked, but y=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nI could take S or something, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set, but I need y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is before the last action? Confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 for offset, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter applying these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFor example, with H=2: actions at t1 and t1+1, so t=11 and 12.\n\nAfter these, position at turn t1+H-1 =11+2-1=12 is y12=9? But from y11=7, I can go to y12=8 or 6 or 7, not directly to 9. Impossible to reach y=9 in one action. Since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo minimal H must be at least 2.\n\nWith H=2: actions a11 and a12.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{11+2-1} = y_{12} =9.\n\nSo at turn 12, y12=9.\n\nBut from y11=7, to have y12=9, I need to increase by 2 in one turn, but Δy is only +1,0,-1, so impossible. Max increase is +1 per turn.\n\nSo y12 can be at most 8, if I go up from 7.\n\ny12 <= y11 +1 =8.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y13 <= y12 +1 <=9, so earliest possible is y13=9, with y12=8 and up.\n\nThus minimal H=3, with y13=9.\n\nWith H=3, actions at t=11,12,13? t from 0 to 2: a11, a12, a13.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{11+3-1} = y_{13} =9.\n\nAt turn 13, I need to be at 9.\n\nTo have that, at turn 12, I must be at 8 and take U, or at 9 and take S, but starting from 7.\n\nSo must be at 8 at turn 12.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At turn 11: I start at y11=7, take action a11, which sets y12.\n\n- At turn 12: I am at y12, take action a12, which sets y13.\n\n- At turn 13: I am at y13, and if y13=9, done.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn T, we check based on y_T.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\n- Turn 11: y11=7, on freeway 7. Cars: as above, at T=11, spans [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a11=U, so y12=8.\n\n- Turn 12: y12=8, on freeway 8. Cars on y=8 at turn 12.\n\nAs computed, for both cars, at T=12, span [13,24] and [61,72], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a12=U, so y13=9.\n\n- Turn 13: y13=9, not freeway, no cars, safe. And y13=9, reached.\n\nBut the action sequence includes a13? With H=3, I have to specify a13, but at turn 13, I am already at 9, so I can take S or U or D, but if I take U, y14=10, but y must be in [0,9], so if y=9, U would make y=10, but y must be in [0,9], so probably I cannot go above 9 or below 0, so actions are constrained.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U is invalid? But the problem doesn't say actions are invalid, it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably it clips or something, but to be safe, I should avoid actions that would take y out of bounds.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", so it is enforced, but for collision, it might not matter.\n\nBut since I need to reach (0,9), and stay or something, but once at 9, I can take S to stay.\n\nIn this case, for a13, I can take S to stay at 9.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=3, I need a13.\n\nIn the direct path, with two actions: a11=U and a12=U, I reach y13=9, and at turn 13, I can take a13=S.\n\nBut with H=3, it includes a13.\n\nI could have H=2, but impossible as above.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thing: is there a car blocking at some point?\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8 at turn 12, it was safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the cars.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 12: T=12, t1=11, T-t1=1.\n\nCars: both right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: τ=49, h=60, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [49 + 12(1), 60 + 12(1)] = [61,72]\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, span [1 +12(1), 12+12(1)] = [13,24]\n\n0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but I only care when I am on them.\n\nIn this path, I only pass through y=7 at turn 11 and y=8 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11, y=7 safe; turn 12, y=8 safe.\n\nThen y=9 at turn 13 safe.\n\nSo it should be fine with H=3.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, which is 3, but is there a way with H=2? No, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 12, but from y=7 at turn 11, I can only be at 6,7,8 at turn 12, not 9.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 12 on y=8, is there really no collision? I think so.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has same as freeway 1 and 7: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt turn 11: [49,60] and [1,12]\n\nAt turn 12: since right-moving, each increases by s*1=12, so [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] and [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], yes 0 not in.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me look at other freeways; for example, on y=7 at turn 11, there is a car with span [1,12], which includes 1 to 12, and 0 is not included, since [1,12] is from 1 to 12, 0<1, so not included.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there is a car at turn 11 with span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if on y=4 at turn 11, collision.\n\nBut I'm not there.\n\nNow, but in my path, I don't go to other y, so should be fine.\n\nBut the player might need to go through other y if blocked, but here not blocked.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at other times, but I only care about the turns I am there.\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can go faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer turns by being at y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nBut with H=3, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 4, for example, to see if there is danger.\n\nFreeway 4: at turn 11, cars:\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,12) d=right, h=-36, τ=-47? Head and tail.\n\nIn the table: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor d=right, span is [τ, h] since τ is tail, h is head, so if moving right, tail left, head right.\n\nSo at t1, span [τ, h]\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nFreeway 4: first car: h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, so τ=-47, h=-36, so at T=11, span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, span [ -11, 0 ] at T=11, which includes 0.\n\nThird car: h=36, τ=25, d=right, span [25,36]\n\nSo at turn 11, on y=4, if player there, collision because 0 in [-11,0].\n\nBut I'm not.\n\nNow, for example, if I were to go to y=4 at some point, I need to avoid when 0 in span.\n\nBut in this case, not needed.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nIn my direct path, it seems collision-free with H=3.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nH=3, actions: a11=U, a12=U, and a13=S or something, but with a13=S.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0: a_{t1} = a11\n\nt=1: a12\n\nt=2: a13 for H=3.\n\na11=U, a12=U, a13=S to stay.\n\nI could do a13=U, but y14=10, which is invalid, so y14=min(9,10)=9? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably it is set to within bounds, but to be precise, it might be clipped, but since we reach at turn 13, it's fine to take S.\n\nBut in the action, I can choose S.\n\nPerhaps I don't need a13 if I reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 11, I am at y=7, if I take U, to y=8 at turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 12, on y=8, is there any car that has 0 in span?\n\nAs above, no.\n\nBut let me see for other turns.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when does the car span include 0.\n\nFor the second car on freeway 8: at T, span [1 + 12(T-11), 12 + 12(T-11)] = [12(T-11) +1, 12(T-11) +12]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: min <= 0 <= max.\n\n12(T-11) +1 <= 0 <= 12(T-11) +12\n\nSince 12(T-11) +1 >0 for T-11 >=0, because at T=11, 1>0, and increases, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, for the first car: [49 +12(T-11), 60+12(T-11)] always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 8, for all T, since the spans start from 1 at min and increase, 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7, same cars, same thing, at turn 11, [1,12] and [49,60], both >0, so 0 never in span for any T.\n\nFor other freeways, let's see if any car can have 0 in span.\n\nFor example, freeway 4: the car with span [-11,0] at T=11.\n\nd=right, s=12, so at T, span [ -11 + 12(T-11), 0 + 12(T-11) ] = [12(T-11) -11, 12(T-11)]\n\nSet 0 in this: 12(T-11) -11 <= 0 <= 12(T-11)\n\nSince 12(T-11) >=0 for T>=11.\n\nSo 0 <= 12(T-11) always true for T>=11? 12(T-11) >=0.\n\nAnd 12(T-11) -11 <=0 when 12(T-11) <=11, so T-11 <= 11/12, so since T integer, T-11=0, T=11.\n\nAt T=11, [12(0)-11, 12(0)] = [-11,0], and 0 is included.\n\nFor T>11, [12(T-11)-11, 12(T-11)]\n\nAt T=12, [12(1)-11, 12(1)] = [12-11,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for T=11 only, 0 in span for that car on y=4.\n\nBut other cars on y=4: first car span [ -47 +12(T-11), -36 +12(T-11) ], which for T=11, [-47,-36], negative, 0 not in; at T=12, [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24], still negative; T=13, [-23,-12], etc., never reaches 0.\n\nThird car [25+12(T-11), 36+12(T-11)] always positive.\n\nSo only on y=4 at turn 11, collision if present.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 3: left-moving, h=-72, τ=-49, s=24, d=left.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-72 -24(T-11), -49 -24(T-11)]\n\nBoth decreasing, always negative, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 5: (-20,-31,right,4), span [ -31 +4(T-11), -20 +4(T-11) ]\n\nAt T=11, [-31,-20], negative; T=12, [-27,-16]; ... when does it cover 0?\n\n-31 +4(T-11) <= 0 <= -20 +4(T-11)\n\nSince the span is moving right, min increasing.\n\nSet min <=0: -31 +4(T-11) <=0 => 4(T-11) <=31 => T-11 <= 7.75, so T<=18 or 19.\n\nSimilarly, max <=0? 0 <= max: 0 <= -20 +4(T-11) => 4(T-11) >=20 => T-11 >=5, T>=16\n\nAnd min <=0: -31 +4(T-11) <=0 => T-11 <= 31/4=7.75, T<=18\n\nSo for T from 16 to 18, 0 in span? Let's see.\n\nAt T=16: min = -31 +4(5) = -31+20= -11, max= -20+20=0, so span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=17: min=-31+24= -7? 4*(17-11)=4*6=24, min=-31+24=-7, max=-20+24=4, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=18: min=-31+28= -3, max=-20+28=8, [ -3,8], includes 0.\n\nT=19: min=-31+32=1, max=-20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other T, not.\n\nBut on freeway 5, y=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 has cars, but I don't go there.\n\nIn my path, I only go through y=7 and y=8, which are always safe for x=0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, with a11=U, a12=U, and a13=S, I can reach.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=3, I need to output actions for turn 11,12,13.\n\na13 can be S.\n\nPerhaps I can have only two actions, but H=3 is minimal.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 13, when I am at y=9, no action needed, but the sequence includes it.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 12 by being at y=8 and going up, but y=9 at turn 13.\n\nUnless I start higher, but I start at 7.\n\nSo I think H=3 is correct.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6 or others, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, I need to make sure.\n\nAnother point: the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, not moving to different y at the same turn; the move happens to next turn.\n\nIn my case, no issue.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 3, with actions U at turn 11, U at turn 12, and S at turn 13.\n\nBut for the sequence, in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut with H=3.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 13, taking S is fine.\n\nI could take no action, but S is stay.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=2 with different path, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: if I go down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, go to y=6, but that might be worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut let me see freeway 7 and 8 cars are the same, and always safe at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7: at any T, spans for the cars: one is around [12(T-11)+1, 12(T-11)+12], which for T>=11, min >=1, so 0 not in; similarly other.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case, it seems 3.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 at turn 12: [13,24] and [61,72], yes.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for the given turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=11.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut with H=3.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid specifying a13, but since H=3, I need to.\n\nBut at turn 13, I am at y=9, and I need to take an action, but since the position is already 9, and I reach at turn 13, it should be fine.\n\nTo be precise, the action at turn 13 doesn't affect reaching, but I have to include it.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H could be less if I start moving earlier, but no, I start at turn 11.\n\nAnother thing: is there a way to be at y=9 at turn 12? No.\n\nUnless I was already moving, but at turn 11, I am at y=7.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6, for example, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, the car spans might cover 0 at some other time, but not at turn 12.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, when does the second car have 0 in span.\n\nSpan [1 + 12(T-11), 12 + 12(T-11)] = [12k +1, 12k +12] for k=T-11.\n\nSet 0 in [12k+1, 12k+12], but 12k+1 >=1 >0 for k>=0, so never.\n\nSimilarly first car [49+12k,60+12k] >=49>0.\n\nSo always safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U, U, S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=0: a11=U, t=1: a12=U, t=2: a13=S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the player position: at turn 11: y=7, after U, y12=8.\n\nTurn 12: y=8, after U, y13=9.\n\nTurn 13: y=9, after S, y14=9, but I don't care.\n\nAnd collision: turn 11: y=7, safe; turn 12: y=8, safe; turn 13: y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nPerhaps I can do it without the S, but H=3 is fixed.\n\nIf I take U at turn 13, y14=10, but y must be in [0,9], so probably y14=9 or error, but to avoid issue, better to take S.\n\nSince y=9, U might be invalid, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think S is safe.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal path requires moving up from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\) and then to \\(y = 9\\), taking at least 2 actions (U at turn 11 and U at turn 12) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13. Thus, \\(H = 3\\) turns are needed, with the sequence ending at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 3 - 1 = 13\\).\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). The cars on freeway 7 at turn 11 have spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\) and \\(0 \\notin [49, 60]\\), no collision occurs. Action U is taken, moving to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 12.\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 12:\n  - First car: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 60\\), \\(s = 12\\), direction right. Span at \\(T = 12\\): \\([49 + 12(12-11), 60 + 12(12-11)] = [61, 72]\\).\n  - Second car: \\(\\tau = 1\\), \\(h = 12\\), \\(s = 12\\), direction right. Span at \\(T = 12\\): \\([1 + 12(12-11), 12 + 12(12-11)] = [13, 24]\\).\n  Since \\(0 \\notin [13, 24]\\) and \\(0 \\notin [61, 72]\\), no collision occurs. Action U is taken, moving to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 13.\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no cars or collision checks apply. Action S is taken to stay at \\(y = 9\\), but since the position is already reached, any action (S, U, or D) would be valid; S is chosen for simplicity.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- \\(H = 3\\) turns.\n- Actions: \\(a_{11} = U\\), \\(a_{12} = U\\), \\(a_{13} = S\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{13} = 9\\) with no collisions and minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player starts at y=8, and I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and the cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8, once I'm at y=9, I don't have to worry about cars anymore because there are no freeways above that. The collision only happens if I'm on a freeway where a car is present at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so I need to be at position (0,9) at some turn, and since it's a grid, I assume that once I'm at (0,9), I stay there or something, but the game might continue, but for this task, I just need to reach it once.\n\nNow, the player can move up, down, or stay each turn. Since I'm at y=8 and need to go to y=9, I could just go up once, but I need to check if that causes a collision.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Cars are on specific y-levels, and for each car, we have head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nThe position is given at turn t_1 = 12, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo current turn is t=12.\n\nPlayer is at (0,8).\n\nCars:\n\nFor each freeway, k from 1 to 8, but freeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k.\n\nNow, for each, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. In the update, left-moving and right-moving are defined.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for car k, head h, tail τ, but in the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which one is larger? It says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], and it moves right, positions increase.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nDirection is right, so Span(t1) should be [τ, h], so τ = -59, h = -48? But it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), so head is -48, tail is -59, but for right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is larger, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn the description: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], which is [tail, head], so tail is smaller, head is larger, and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h larger, τ smaller, moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret head and tail correctly.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so since it's moving right, head should be the right end, which is larger, but -48 > -59, so head = -48, tail = -59, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head would be left, tail right or something.\n\nIn the left-moving example: for freeway 3: (48, 71, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, and head=48, tail=71, but 48 < 71, so if moving left, head should be the left end? But in the span definition, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and if h=48, τ=71, then [48,71], but moving left, positions decrease, so at T, [48 - sΔT, 71 - sΔT].\n\nBut [48,71] with 48<71, so it's from left to right? No.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nNow, in this, if [h, τ] is an interval, it should be that h and τ are the endpoints, and for left-moving, as time increases, both decrease.\n\nBut in the interval [h, τ], it doesn't specify which is min or max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere [τ, h], so τ might be the left end, h the right end for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, first car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSince direction right, and head is given as -48, tail as -59, and -48 > -59, so head is the front (right end), tail is rear (left end). So for right-moving, Span should be [tail, head] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 3: (48, 71, left, 24), head=48, tail=71, 48<71, so if moving left, head might be the front (left end), tail the rear (right end), so Span = [head, tail] = [48,71], which matches the left-moving definition.\n\nIn general, for a car, head is the front in the direction of movement, tail is the rear.\n\nFor right-moving, front is right, so head > tail.\n\nFor left-moving, front is left, so head < tail.\n\nIn freeway 1, first car: head=-48, tail=-59, since right-moving, head > tail, -48 > -59, good.\n\nSecond car on freeway 1: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, 24>13, so head>tail, good.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-95,right,48), head=-48, tail=-95, -48 > -95, good.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,71,left,24), head=48, tail=71, 48<71, so head<tail for left-moving, good.\n\nFreeway 4: first car (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, -24 > -35, good.\n\nSecond car (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, 12>1, good.\n\nThird car (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, 48>37, good.\n\nFreeway 5: (-16,-27,right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, -16 > -27, good.\n\nFreeway 6: first car (-16,-27,right,4), similar.\n\nSecond car (60,49,right,4), head=60, tail=49, 60>49, good.\n\nThird car (24,13,right,4), head=24, tail=13, 24>13, good.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1 and 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1) for that freeway.\"\n\nThe key point is: at each turn T, the player is on a specific y-level, y_T, and we check if at that turn T, for freeway y_T, is 0 in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThe car positions are updated based on T - t1, with t1=12.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=8 to y=9, starting from turn 12.\n\nSince y=9 is the target and no cars, I just need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H could be 1, if I can go up immediately to y=9 at turn 13.\n\nBut I need to check if at turn 12, when I'm at y=8, if there is a collision or not, but at turn 12, I'm already at y=8, so I need to check if at turn 12, for freeway 8, is 0 in any car span.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nAt turn t1=12, for freeway 8.\n\nFirst car: direction right, speed 12, head h= -48? Let's compute span at T=12.\n\nt1=12, so for any turn T, ΔT = T - 12.\n\nAt T=12, ΔT=0, so for first car, right-moving, Span(12) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48] since τ=tail=-59, h=head=-48.\n\nSimilarly, second car, [13,24]? Tail=13, head=24? For second car on freeway 8: (24,13,right,12), so head=24, tail=13, so Span(12) = [τ, h] = [13,24].\n\nNow, is 0 in [13,24]? 0 < 13, not in. In [-59,-48], -59 <= 0 <= -48? -59 <= 0 is true, 0 <= -48? 0 > -48, so 0 > -48, not <=, so 0 not <= -48, so 0 not in [-59,-48] because -48 < 0.\n\n[ -59, -48 ] is from -59 to -48, both negative, so 0 is greater than -48, not in the interval. Similarly, [13,24] is all positive, 0 not in. So at T=12, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in span, so no collision at start.\n\nNow, if I want to go to y=9 at turn 13, I need to take action U at turn 12, so y_{13} = y_{12} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nAt turn 12, when I take action, I am still on y=8 during turn 12, and since no collision at T=12, as above.\n\nThen at turn 13, I am at y=9, and since y=9 has no freeway or no cars, I don't care, I have reached (0,9).\n\nIs that correct?\n\ny=9 is the top, and freeways are only from 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision rule.\n\nCollision occurs only if on freeway y=1 to 8 and 0 in car span at that turn.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at y=9, not on any freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, I am on y=8, and no collision as above.\n\nSo with H=1, action at t=12: U, then at turn 13, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions, so from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and after H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1}, which is action at turn t1, affecting position at turn t1+1.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nStart at turn t1=12, position y_{12} = 8.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy.\n\nIf a_{12} = U, then y_{13} = 9.\n\nThen we have reached (0,9) at turn 13.\n\nH=1, since one action.\n\nThe minimal H should be 1 if possible.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 that could cause collision at turn 12? We checked, no.\n\nPerhaps I need to check for the move.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=8, and I take action U.\n\nDuring turn 12, I am on y=8, and we check collision for turn 12.\n\nAs above, no issue.\n\nThen at turn 13, I am on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? Maybe for going down or something, but I don't need to go down.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at other turns, but since I only stay for one turn, and move immediately.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars at t=12:\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span [ -59, -48 ] at T=12.\n\n-59 to -48, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [13,24], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, the player position is at x=0, and cars spans, we care if 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with one up move, I can reach.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and H=1 seems possible.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot.\n\nPerhaps at turn 12, but I am already at y=8, and moving up.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, and at turn T+1, on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 9, but y=9 has no freeway.\n\nFreeways only 1-8.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me look at the car states; maybe for other freeways, but I don't care since I'm not on them.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\nPlayer at (0,8), so y=8.\n\nTarget (0,9).\n\nSo with U at t=12, to y=9 at t=13.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? Maybe if I had to move through them, but I don't need to.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at turn 12, it is safe, but maybe at other turns if I delay.\n\nBut since I can go immediately, no need.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision definition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, regardless of action.\n\nThe action affects y_{T+1}, but at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nSo for turn T, collision check based on y_T and car on that y at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at t=12, y=8, cars on y=8 at t=12, spans as above, 0 not in any, so safe.\n\nThen action U at t=12, y_{13}=9, reached.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8) at turn t1=12, and we need to reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nWith one action, we reach at turn 13.\n\nH=1, sequence: Turn 12: U\n\nBut the answer should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nStart at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nWith H=1, y_{13}=9.\n\nAnd action at t=12: U.\n\nBut let me see if for freeway 8, at turn 12, it is safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that cars move, but at turn 12, it's fixed for that turn.\n\nAnother thing: the car spans are given at t1=12, and for other turns, we compute with T-t1.\n\nBut for t=12, ΔT=0, so as above.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, if I stay, but I don't stay.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars and freeways? Maybe for this specific position, it is possible to go up directly.\n\nPerhaps I misread the initial position.\n\nInitial position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8)\n\nTarget (0,9)\n\nCars on y=1 to 8, but y=8 has cars, but at t=12, no car at x=0.\n\nLet me check if at turn 12, for y=8, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: [-59,-48], min -59, max -48, both <0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [13,24], min 13, max 24, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo no.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, irrelevant.\n\nSo I think with one up move, it should work.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with one action, we do.\n\nMinimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be a sequence.\n\nSo for H=1, only one action: Turn t1: U, which is Turn 12: U\n\nThen at turn 13, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=1, only t=12.\n\nThen the player reaches at turn 13.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t1 + H.\n\nBut the task is to reach at some turn, and minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at position.\n\nWe want that position to be (0,9).\n\nWith H=1, we reach at turn 13.\n\nPerhaps H=0, but H=0 means no action, but at turn 12, y=8 ≠9, so we need to move, so H at least 1.\n\nAnd with H=1, it works.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and maybe I missed something.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but there is no freeway, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, safe.\n\nAt turn 12, player at (0,8), which is on freeway 8.\n\nAfter moving to y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the cars on freeway 8 might cover x=0 at other turns, but since I only care about turn 12 for y=8, and I move away immediately, it should be fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if at turn 13, on y=9, no freeway.\n\nOr if I had to be on y=8 at turn 13, but I'm not.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 for turn 13, but I won't be there.\n\nFor example, at turn 13, ΔT = T-t1 =13-12=1.\n\nFor first car on freeway 8, right-moving, speed 12, so Span(13) = [τ + s*1, h + s*1] = [-59 +12, -48 +12] = [-47, -36], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car, [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36], positive, 0 not in.\n\nBut I'm not on y=8 at turn 13, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"multi-turn game\", but it doesn't mean I can't do it in one turn.\n\nMaybe I need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for H=1, the sequence is only one action: Turn 12: U\n\nThen we are done.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason why I cannot go up immediately.\n\nAnother point: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy from action.\n\nAnd y must be in [0,9], so from y=8, U to 9, fine; D to 7; S to 8.\n\nAll valid.\n\nSo I think it's possible.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, there is a car that I didn't see.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars: one from -59 to -48, one from 13 to 24 at t=12.\n\nNo car near 0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 has cars at x= -35 to -24, 1 to 12, and 37 to 48, etc., but not at 0 at t=12.\n\nBut irrelevant.\n\nSo I think with one up move, it works.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action: Turn 12: U\n\nBut the answer format should be in a box.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn 12: U }\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=12, so action at turn 12.\n\nSequence for t from 0 to H-1, so for H=1, only t=0, which is turn t1 + 0 =12.\n\nAction a_{12} = U.\n\nThen at turn 13, position (0,9).\n\nReached.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the initial position.\n\n\"Player Position: (0, 8)\" at turn 12.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe y=8 is not the top, y=9 is top.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, it is considered, but the freeways are only 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nThe collision rule says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so only when on those y-levels.\n\nAt y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 12.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nAt turn 12, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 12 are:\n- Car 1: head = -48, tail = -59, direction = right, speed = 12. Span at \\(T = 12\\) is \\([\\tau, h] = [-59, -48]\\). Since \\(-59 \\leq x \\leq -48\\) and \\(0 \\notin [-59, -48]\\), 0 is not in the span.\n- Car 2: head = 24, tail = 13, direction = right, speed = 12. Span at \\(T = 12\\) is \\([\\tau, h] = [13, 24]\\). Since \\(13 \\leq x \\leq 24\\) and \\(0 \\notin [13, 24]\\), 0 is not in the span.\n\nThus, there is no collision at turn 12 on freeway 8.\n\nBy taking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 12, the player moves to \\(y_{13} = y_{12} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\\). At turn 13, the player is at (0, 9). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), there are no cars, and no collision can occur. Therefore, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 13.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 1, as only one action is required. The sequence of actions is for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 0\\), so only turn 12.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 12: U }",
