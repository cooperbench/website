        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake, and I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn t1 = 0.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n\n- The grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, meaning I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n- Snake positions: only one segment at (3,3). Since it's just the head, no body yet. The head direction is left, so moving L (left).\n\n- Food items:\n\n  - (3,5) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive food)\n\n  - (6,6) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n\n  - (2,3) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food has value +1 and life_span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so I have 9 more turns to eat each before they vanish.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment long, eating food will increase its length to 2, then 3, etc.\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n\n- I can move Up (U: y+1), Down (D: y-1), Left (L: x-1), Right (R: x+1).\n\n- No instant reverse: since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\n- Collisions: hitting walls or body kills me. But since no body yet, only walls matter. Also, tail collision rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nBut right now, no tail, so that's not an issue.\n\n**Special Food Rule:** Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves onto it. Currently, no food under snake, since snake is at (3,3) and food at (3,5), (6,6), (2,3). (2,3) is adjacent to head? Head at (3,3), so (2,3) is left of head.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction L, so if I move L, I go to (2,3), which has food.\n\n**Immediate Options at Turn 0:**\n\nCurrent position: (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so I cannot move R because current direction is L, opposite would be R. So allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\n- Move L to (2,3): there is food at (2,3), so I can eat it. Value +1, length becomes 2.\n\n- Move U to (3,4): no food there.\n\n- Move D to (3,2): no food there.\n\n(3,4) and (3,2) are empty cells.\n\nFood is at (3,5), (6,6), (2,3). So (2,3) has food.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I eat the food, score +1, snake grows to length 2. New head position (2,3), direction L (since I moved L).\n\nThen the body segment would be at previous head, (3,3).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, if I eat (2,3) now, I get immediate reward, but I should consider long-term.\n\nOther foods: (3,5) is above, (6,6) is far.\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is two cells up from (3,3), since (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5), but (3,5) is clear.\n\nGrid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in coordinates, y increases up, but in games, sometimes y increases down. I need to clarify.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), which is up, so y+1 is upwards, so higher y is north.\n\nSimilarly, D is y-1, down.\n\nSo walls: y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake at (3,3), which is middle-left.\n\nFood at (3,5): two above, (6,6): far right-top, (2,3): left adjacent.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5), so (3,5) is accessible, but (3,6) is wall, so I can't go there.\n\nNow, life_span: all food has life_span 10 at turn 0. Since turn count decreases each turn, including current, after turn 0, life_span becomes 9 for all, and so on. They disappear when life_span reaches 0.\n\nI have up to turn 9 to eat them, since at turn 10, they vanish? Let's see: at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, so if N=10 at turn 0, it will disappear at the start of turn 10, meaning I can eat it up to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn k, if life_span is L, it can be eaten until turn k + L - 1.\n\nAt turn 0, L=10, can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nBut since we're at turn 0, and I act, then turn 1, etc.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3) and eat food.\n\nThen snake becomes: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). Length 2. Direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, L (since not reverse, direction is L, so can move U, D, L, not R).\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U to (2,4)\n\n- D to (2,2)\n\n- L to (1,3)\n\nNow, foods: (3,5) at (3,5), which is east and up; (6,6) far.\n\nAlso, after eating, there might be new food, but for now, only these.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (3,4). No food, so no growth. Head now at (3,4), direction U (since I moved U).\n\nThen body still only head, no change.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) to eat that food.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (3,2). Similar, but no food there.\n\nMove D might not be good, since (3,2) is close to bottom wall? y=0 is bottom, (3,2) is y=2, so not wall.\n\nBut no immediate benefit.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating (2,3) gives immediate +1, but I should see if I can get more.\n\n(2,3) is easy to eat now, but if I don't eat it, it might disappear or I might not get it later.\n\nLife_span 10, so I have time, but 10 turns is long.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut with one snake segment, moving is safe, no body to hit.\n\nLet's think about the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,6).\n\nSo the cell (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, to reach (3,5): from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is far, need to go right and up.\n\n(2,3) is adjacent left.\n\nIf I eat (2,3) first, I grow to length 2, then I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), body at (3,3).\n\nThen if I move, say, U to (2,4), head at (2,4), body moves to (2,3)? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSince length 2: head moves, tail moves to where head was? Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nIn this case, when no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail segment is removed (so length same), but when food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nInitially, no body, so after eating first food, length 2, positions: head and one body segment.\n\nWhen I move, head moves to new cell, and if no food, the tail cell is vacated, so the body segment at tail disappears? No.\n\nSnake positions: list of coordinates. Head first, then body segments.\n\nWhen moving, new head position based on direction, then the tail end is removed if no food eaten, else if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added? No.\n\nStandard: when you move to a cell without food, the head moves to new cell, the tail segment is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nWhen you move to a cell with food, head moves to new cell, food eaten, no tail removed, so a new segment is added at the tail end? But the tail position doesn't change immediately; the new segment is added after the move.\n\nTypically in snake: before move, snake has positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail].\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is the old position of the second last segment.\n\nIf food eaten, after moving, the tail is not removed, so the new tail position is added, meaning the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added at the head? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten during the move, after moving the head to the food cell, the tail does not advance; it stays in place, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail end.\n\nFor example, snake at positions [A, B] for length 2. A head, B tail.\n\nMove head to C (with food), then new positions: [C, A], and since food eaten, no tail removed, so now length 3, positions [C, A, B]? No.\n\nStandard: positions list: index 0 is head.\n\nAfter moving to new head position, say new_head.\n\nThen if no food, the new body is the old body without the last element (tail removed).\n\nIf food eaten, the new body is the old body plus the old head, so the tail is not removed; it stays, and new head is added.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nInitial: positions [P0] (head only)\n\nAfter move to new position P1:\n\n- If no food at P1, new positions [P1], length 1 (tail removed, but no tail, so still head only).\n\n- If food at P1, new positions [P1, P0], length 2.\n\nThen next move: from [P1, P0], head P1.\n\nMove to new position P2:\n\n- If no food at P2, new positions [P2, P1] (tail P0 removed)\n\n- If food at P2, new positions [P2, P1, P0] (tail not removed)\n\nSimilarly for longer snake.\n\nIn this case, at turn 0, positions [(3,3)], head only.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) and eat food, new positions: head at (2,3), and body at (3,3), so [(2,3), (3,3)].\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen if I move to, say, (2,4) with no food, new positions: head to (2,4), body moves to where head was, (2,3), so [(2,4), (2,3)], tail (3,3) removed.\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, it grows.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt turn 0, I can:\n\n- Move L to (2,3): eat food, score +1, length 2, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\n- Move U to (3,4): no food, score 0, length 1, positions [(3,4)]\n\n- Move D to (3,2): no food, score 0, length 1, positions [(3,2)]\n\n- Move R to (4,3): but current direction L, moving R is opposite, not allowed. So only U, D, L possible.\n\nSince direction L, I can only move U, D, L, not R.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,4), then from there I can go U to (3,5) to eat that food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D, I go away from foods.\n\nFoods are at (2,3), (3,5), (6,6). (2,3) is left, (3,5) is up, (6,6) is northeast.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then on next turn I can move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, so I eat it at turn 1 if I do that.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,3) now, I get +1 immediately.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is the negative food rule, but all current foods are positive, value 1, so no negative food.\n\nAnd tail reward danger: not applicable yet.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should aim to eat all three foods if possible, but they might disappear, life_span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut after eating, new food might spawn, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so I think only these three foods exist for now. The problem doesn't specify food spawning, so I assume only the given foods are present, and no new ones, unless stated otherwise.\n\nIn the food mechanics, it says \"food can spawn\", but in this state, only three are given, so for planning, I should consider only these.\n\nPerhaps food is static for now.\n\nSo I need to eat these three.\n\nNow, distances:\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3): distance 1, can eat now.\n\nTo (3,5): distance 2, can eat in 2 turns if go directly.\n\nTo (6,6): Manhattan distance |6-3| + |6-3| = 3+3=6, so at least 6 turns to reach, but with snake growth, it might take more if I have to maneuver.\n\nBut since I start short, I can go directly.\n\nBut there are walls, but no obstacles in between except borders.\n\n(6,6) is near top-right, x=6,y=6, walls at x=7,y=7, so (6,6) is safe.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5), not affecting (6,6).\n\nNow, if I eat (2,3) now, I grow to length 2, head at (2,3), body at (3,3).\n\nThen I need to go to (3,5) or (6,6).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), then? (2,4) to (3,4) or (2,5), but (3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), then from (2,4), I can move R to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut at (3,4), if I move to (3,5), I eat.\n\nBut from (2,3), after moving U to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,3) if no food, or if food, but no food at (2,4).\n\nAssume no other food.\n\nSimilarly, from there to (3,4), then to (3,5).\n\nEating at (3,5) on turn 2 or 3.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,3) now, and go directly to (3,5).\n\nFor example, at turn 0, move U to (3,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 1, move U to (3,5), eat food, score +1, length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,3) or (6,6).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is left and down from (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), direction U (since moved U).\n\nCan move U, but (3,6) is wall, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nMove D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, since positions [(3,5), (3,4)], so body at (3,4), so moving to (3,4) would collide with body, death.\n\nCannot move there.\n\nMove L to (2,5), or R to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,3), from (3,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3), but at (2,3) there is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nIf at turn 1, I eat (3,5), then at turn 2, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) (assuming no wall), (2,5) is within bounds, x=2>0, y=5<7, so ok. No food at (2,5)? Food only at given positions, (2,3) has food, (2,5) no.\n\nSo move L to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), body (3,5) — since no food, tail removed, so positions [(2,5), (3,5)] but when moving from [(3,5), (3,4)] to (2,5), new head (2,5), body should be the old head position? Positions before move: head (3,5), body (3,4).\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), and body becomes the previous body segment, which is (3,4)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ] index 0 and 1.\n\nHead moves to new position (2,5).\n\nSince no food, tail (index 1, (3,4)) is removed, so new positions: [ (2,5) ] and the body is only (3,5)? No.\n\nStandard: the new head is (2,5), and the new body is the previous head position, so [ (2,5), (3,5) ].\n\nBecause the segment that was head becomes the new body segment.\n\nThen tail ( (3,4) ) is removed.\n\nSo positions become [ (2,5), (3,5) ].\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,5) ]\n\nThen move D to (2,3), which has food, so eat, score +1, length 3, positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ]? After moving to (2,3) with food, new head (2,3), and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the body includes the previous tail.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (2,4), (2,5) ] head (2,4)\n\nMove to (2,3) with food, new head (2,3), and the body is the previous positions, so [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] since food eaten, no tail removed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo to eat (2,3) from (3,5), it takes a few turns.\n\nIf I eat (2,3) first at turn 0, then go to (3,5).\n\nAfter eating (2,3) at turn 0, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nAt turn 1, from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,3) ]  (tail (3,3) removed)\n\nThen turn 2, move R to (3,4), no food, positions [ (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (3,5), eat food, positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] or something.\n\nEat at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,6).\n\nNow, the third food at (6,6).\n\nFrom anywhere, it's at (6,6).\n\nBut with life_span 10, I have time.\n\nHowever, after eating foods, the snake grows, and it might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut initially, it's easy.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dying.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, no food on tail positions.\n\nBut in future, when I have body, and food spawns under body, but for now, no.\n\nAlso, in this state, all foods are on empty cells.\n\n(2,3) is empty, (3,5) empty, (6,6) empty, snake at (3,3), so no overlap.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nFirst, if I eat (2,3) at turn 0:\n\n- Turn 0: move L to (2,3), eat, score +1, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 1: from (2,3), I can move U, D, L (not R, reverse).\n\nSay I move U to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,3) ]  (tail removed)\n\nDirection U now.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), move R to (3,4), no food, positions [ (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (3,5), eat, score +1, positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ]  (since food eaten, no tail remove, so body includes (3,4) and (2,4))\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, at (3,5), I can move to eat (6,6) or other.\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, so cannot go up.\n\nCan move L, R, D.\n\nMove D to (3,4) but body at (3,4), collision.\n\nMove L to (2,5), or R to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo go to (6,6), I need to go right and up, but y=5, (6,6) is y=6, so up one.\n\nFrom (3,5), move R to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nBut at (6,6) eat.\n\nBut positions: after turn 3, I have positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5), no food, positions: head to (4,5), body to (3,5), and tail (2,4) removed? No.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] head (3,5)\n\nMove to (4,5) no food, new head (4,5), body: previous head becomes body, so (3,5) and then the next body segment? Positions list: index 0 head, 1,2 body.\n\nAfter move, new head (4,5), and new body is the old body without the last if no food.\n\nOld positions: [A, B, C] = [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to new position D, no food, new positions: [D, A, B] and C removed? No.\n\nStandard: the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ...] but when no food, the last element (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] and (2,4) removed.\n\nLength 3 to 2? No, from length 3, after move no food, length 3, but tail removed, so positions: new head (4,5), then the first body is old head (3,5), then the second body is old body1 (3,4), and old tail (2,4) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nYes, length 3, but the tail is now (3,4).\n\nThen turn 5: move R to (5,5), no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (6,5), no food, positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (6,6), eat, score +1, positions [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] since food eaten, no tail remove.\n\nSo I ate (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nTotal score 2 by turn 7: (2,3) at turn 0, (3,5) at turn 3, (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nBut (6,6) life_span 10, at turn 7 it is still there, since turn 0 to 7, 8 turns passed, life_span decreases by 8, from 10 to 2, so at turn 7, life_span=2, can be eaten.\n\nAt turn k, for food with initial life L at turn 0, life at turn k is L - k, and it disappears when life <=0, so at turn k, if life_span >0, can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 7, life_span = 10 - 7 = 3? Life_span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, for food, life_span decreases by 1 each turn starting from turn t when it exists.\n\nAt turn 0, life_span=10.\n\nAfter turn 0, at start of turn 1, life_span=9 for all food.\n\nSimilarly, at start of turn k, life_span = 10 - k.\n\nIt can be eaten during turn k if life_span >0.\n\nDisappears at turn when life_span becomes 0, before turn starts or after? The rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span N, it decreases to N-1 at end of turn or something.\n\nLet's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, for a food with initial N, the countdown is N - (t - t1) or something.\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn), life_span is given as N.\n\nAfter each turn, including t1, the countdown decreases.\n\nAfter N turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, countdown = N.\n\nAfter turn t1, countdown = N-1.\n\nAfter turn t1+1, countdown = N-2, and so on.\n\nAfter turn t1 + N -1, countdown =1.\n\nAfter turn t1 + N, it disappears, so cannot be eaten on or after turn t1 + N.\n\nIt can be eaten from turn t1 to turn t1 + N -1.\n\nIn this case, t1=0, N=10, can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, countdown=1, after eaten or not, after turn 9, countdown=0, disappears.\n\nSo for (6,6), as long as I eat by turn 9, ok.\n\nIn my plan, I ate at turn 7, fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in this plan, I ate two foods by turn 3, and third by turn 7.\n\nScore 3.\n\nBut I could eat (3,5) first faster.\n\nAlternative: at turn 0, move U to (3,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), eat, score +1, positions [(3,5), (3,4)] length 2.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, at (3,5), cannot move U to (3,6) wall.\n\nCan move L, R, D.\n\nMove D to (3,4) but body at (3,4), collision, death.\n\nCannot.\n\nMove L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nMove L to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (3,5) ] (since no food, tail removed? Before move positions [(3,5), (3,4)], move to (2,5) no food, new head (2,5), body (3,5), and tail (3,4) removed, so positions [ (2,5), (3,5) ]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen move D to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,5) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen move D to (2,3), eat, score +1, positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ]  (food eaten)\n\nSo ate (2,3) at turn 3.\n\nThen to eat (6,6), from (2,3), need to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,3), after eating, positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] head (2,3)\n\nCan move L, R, D (not U, since direction D? Last move was D to (2,3), so direction D.\n\nCan move L to (1,3), R to (3,3), D to (2,2).\n\nTo go to (6,6), need to move right.\n\nSay move R to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty? Positions: body at (2,4) and (2,5), so (3,3) is free.\n\nMove R to (3,3), no food, positions: new head (3,3), body (2,3), and tail (2,4) removed? Before move [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] head (2,3)\n\nMove to (3,3) no food, new head (3,3), body: old head becomes body, so (2,3), and then (2,4), but tail (2,5) removed? Positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ] and (2,5) removed.\n\nLength 3 to 2? From length 3, after move no food, new positions [new_head, old_head, old_body1] but old_body1 is (2,4), and old_tail (2,5) removed, so [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ]? Indices: old [0:(2,3), 1:(2,4), 2:(2,5)]\n\nNew head (3,3), then new body: old [0] becomes new [1], old [1] becomes new [2], and old [2] removed.\n\nSo [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nYes, tail at (2,4).\n\nThen from (3,3), can move to (4,3), etc. to (6,6).\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, to (6,6) from (3,3), need 3 right, 3 up, but with body, need to path.\n\nBut possible.\n\nHowever, eating (2,3) later means I might not get it if I delay too much, but life_span 10, turn 3 is fine.\n\nIn first plan, I ate (2,3) at turn 0 and (3,5) at turn 3, so same as here ate (3,5) at turn 1 and (2,3) at turn 3.\n\nIn second, ate (3,5) turn 1, (2,3) turn 3.\n\nThen (6,6) around turn 7-8.\n\nBut in first plan, I also have (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nNow, if I go directly to (6,6) first.\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and (2,3) and (3,5) are closer, might disappear if I ignore, but life_span 10, I can go to (6,6) in 6 turns, eat at turn 6, then come back for others.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move R to (4,3), no food, positions [(4,3)] length 1.\n\nThen move R to (5,3), no food, positions [(5,3)]\n\nThen move R to (6,3), no food, positions [(6,3)]\n\nThen move U to (6,4), no food, positions [(6,4)]\n\nU to (6,5), no food, positions [(6,5)]\n\nU to (6,6), eat, score +1, positions [(6,6), (6,5)] length 2.\n\nBut this takes 6 turns to eat one food, while the closer ones might be eaten faster.\n\nAnd (2,3) and (3,5) can be eaten later, but with life_span 10, at turn 6, life_span=4 for all, so I can go back.\n\nBut the snake is longer, harder to maneuver in the left area.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), to go to (2,3), it's far, and walls.\n\nBut possible.\n\nHowever, since (2,3) and (3,5) are closer, it's better to eat them first to grow and then go to far one.\n\nEating (2,3) immediately gives me +1 now, and I can plan from there.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nCurrently, no risks since no body.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), which blocks going up from (3,5).\n\nIn the area, from (3,5), I cannot go up, so I have to go left, right, or down.\n\nBut down might lead to collision if body there.\n\nIn my first plan, after eating (2,3) and (3,5), I was at (3,5) with body around.\n\nBut I moved right to go to (6,6).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all, but with three foods, score 3.\n\nBut perhaps I can do it faster.\n\nSince the snake is short, moving to (2,3) is efficient.\n\nBut let's consider not eating (2,3) now and go to (3,5) first.\n\nAt turn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), eat, score +1, positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow at turn 2, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nSay move L to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (3,5) ]  (tail (3,4) removed)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,5) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,3), eat, score +1, positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ]\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (6,6).\n\nBut it's similar.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 1, I could move R to (4,5), then continue to (6,6).\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5), no food, positions: from [(3,5), (3,4)] move to (4,5) no food, new head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4) removed, so positions [ (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,5), no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5), no food, positions [ (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6), eat, score +1, positions [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nThen I have (2,3) uneaten, I can go back.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,3), it's far, and snake length 3 now.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, cannot.\n\nPositions [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ], head (6,6), can move U, but y=6, U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nR to (7,6) but x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nL to (5,6), or D to (6,5) but body at (6,5), collision.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,6), if within bounds.\n\nx=5,y=6, x=5>0, y=6<7, no wall, ok.\n\nMove L to (5,6), no food, positions: new head (5,6), body (6,6), tail (6,5) removed? Before move [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ] head (6,6)\n\nMove to (5,6) no food, new head (5,6), body: old head (6,6) and old body1 (6,5)? New positions [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] and (5,5) removed.\n\nThen from there, I need to go down and left to (2,3), but it will take many turns, and (2,3) might disappear if life_span low.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (6,6), turn 5, life_span of (2,3) is 10-5=5, so 5 turns left, can be eaten by turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is not body, in positions [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ], body at (6,6) and (6,5), (5,5) is free.\n\nMove D to (5,5), no food, positions new head (5,5), body (5,6), and tail (6,6) removed? Old positions [0:(5,6), 1:(6,6), 2:(6,5)]\n\nMove to (5,5) no food, new head (5,5), new body: old [0] -> (5,6), and old [1] -> (6,6), old [2] removed, so [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]\n\nThen continue left and down.\n\nBut it will take at least |5-2| + |5-3| = 3+2=5 moves to (2,3), but with turns, and snake, might be more.\n\nBy turn 10, might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) at turn 6, move L to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut possible, but risky if I get stuck.\n\nWhereas if I eat (2,3) and (3,5) first, then (6,6), it's safer and faster for the close ones.\n\nEating (2,3) at turn 0 gives me an immediate point and I start growing early.\n\nMoreover, in terms of survival, with longer snake, it might be harder, but in this case, the grid is open except for the obstacle.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect movements near (3,5).\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I cannot go up, so I have to go left, right, or down.\n\nBut down can be dangerous if body is below.\n\nIn the beginning, no body.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 decision.\n\nI think eating (2,3) at turn 0 is good because:\n\n- Immediate score +1\n\n- Snake grows to length 2, which might allow me to access areas or something, but not necessary.\n\n- (2,3) is adjacent and easy to eat now.\n\nIf I don't eat it, and go to (3,5), I eat (3,5) at turn 1, but then (2,3) takes longer to eat.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat all.\n\nHowever, by eating (2,3) first, I have a body segment, but it doesn't block much.\n\nAlso, for long-term, I need to think about the tail reward danger, but no food on body now.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,3) might be eaten later, but if I leave it, and the snake grows, I might not be able to eat it easily if the body is around, but since it's a single cell, I can still eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut with body, I need to ensure that when I move to it, the cell is free, which it is.\n\nFor example, if I have a long snake, the cell (2,3) might be occupied by body, then I cannot eat it, but if it's not occupied, I can.\n\nIn this case, since I start near, I can eat it early.\n\nI think it's better to eat it now.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", but here no immediate danger, so eating food is good for score.\n\nAlso, \"maximize score\", so I should eat as much as possible.\n\nNow, for the 5+ turns plan.\n\nAt turn 0, move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen, from there, I need to go to (3,5).\n\nAs before, move U to (2,4), then R to (3,4), then U to (3,5).\n\nBut at (3,4), when I move U to (3,5), I eat.\n\nThen from (3,5), go to (6,6).\n\nBut to go to (6,6), from (3,5), I can move right directly.\n\nBut with the body.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) at turn 3, positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] or something.\n\nFrom earlier: after turn 3 in first plan, positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] head (3,5)\n\nThen to go right, move R to (4,5), no food, positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]  (tail (2,4) removed)\n\nThen move R to (5,5), no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nThen move R to (6,5), no food, positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nThen move U to (6,6), eat, positions [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nAll good.\n\nI could from (3,5) move to other directions, but right is direct.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to at least 5 turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions for the current and future turns, I think for as many as I plan, but probably I need to specify a sequence.\n\nThe format says: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"where each action\", so I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions? But the actions depend on the state, which changes.\n\nIn the output, I should provide a fixed sequence based on the current state, assuming no new food or changes, but the state might have new food, but in this case, no information, so I assume only current foods.\n\nI think for the purpose, I can provide a sequence that aims to eat the foods.\n\nSince the grid is static, I can plan a path.\n\nBut to be safe, I can provide actions for the first few turns.\n\nThe instruction is to output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nLet me define a plan.\n\nAt turn 0, move L to eat (2,3).\n\nThen turn 1, move U to (2,4) to position for going to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 2, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen from there, turn 4, move R to (4,5) towards (6,6).\n\nTurn 5, move R to (5,5).\n\nTurn 6, move R to (6,5).\n\nTurn 7, move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut this is 8 actions, but I need to output only the sequence, and for thinking ahead, but output can be multiple.\n\nIn the answer, I can list for several turns.\n\nBut since the state changes, and I might need to react, but for this problem, I think providing a sequence based on current knowledge is fine.\n\nPerhaps for the first 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the immediate actions.\n\nAnother idea: since (2,3) is left, and current direction L, moving L is natural.\n\nIf I move U first, I can eat (3,5) faster, but (2,3) might be left behind, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut with life_span, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's calculate the score.\n\nIf I eat (2,3) at turn 0, score +1.\n\nThen (3,5) at turn 3, score +1.\n\nThen (6,6) at turn 7, score +1.\n\nTotal 3 by turn 7.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) at turn 1, score +1.\n\nThen (2,3) at turn 3 or 4, score +1.\n\nThen (6,6) at turn 5 or 6, similar.\n\nIn the second approach, if I go to (3,5) first:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), eat.\n\nScore +1 at turn 1.\n\nThen to eat (2,3): turn 2 move L to (2,5), turn 3 move D to (2,4), turn 4 move D to (2,3) eat, score +1 at turn 4.\n\nThen to (6,6): from (2,3) at turn 4, positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] or something, need to go to (6,6).\n\nMove R to (3,3), etc., but (3,3) might be free.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,3), no food, positions [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ] (tail removed)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,3), no food, positions [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (4,4), no food, positions [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,5), no food, positions [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,5), no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,5), no food, positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 11: move U to (6,6), eat, but at turn 11, life_span: at turn 11, for food at (6,6), initial life 10, can be eaten up to turn 9, turn 10 it disappears, so at turn 11, it is gone, cannot eat.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 11, food disappeared.\n\nLife-span: disappears after N turns, N=10.\n\nAfter 10 turns, at turn 10, it disappears.\n\nCan be eaten up to turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, if I move to (6,6), I can eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, I am at (5,5), moving to (6,5) at turn 10, not to (6,6).\n\nAt turn 9, from (4,5), I moved to (5,5), not directly to (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) by turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,3) at turn 4, after eating.\n\nTurn 4: positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] head (2,3)\n\nTo go to (6,6), I need to move right and up.\n\nShortest path: from (2,3) to (6,6) is delta x=4, delta y=3, so 7 moves, but with snake, I can move directly.\n\nFor example, turn 5: move R to (3,3), no food, positions [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ] (tail (2,5) removed)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,4), no food, positions [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5), but (3,5) has food? (3,5) food was eaten at turn 1, so no food there now. Foods are eaten and removed, so after eating, no food at that cell.\n\nSo (3,5) is empty now.\n\nMove U to (3,4)? Body at (3,4)? Positions before turn 7: [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) ] head (3,4)\n\nMove U to (3,5), no food, positions new head (3,5), body (3,4), and tail (3,3) removed? New positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,3) ]? Old positions [0:(3,4), 1:(3,3), 2:(2,3)]\n\nMove to (3,5) no food, new head (3,5), new body: old [0] -> (3,4), old [1] -> (3,3), old [2] removed, so [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nThen turn 8: move R to (4,5), no food, positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,5), no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,5), no food, positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 11: move U to (6,6), but no food or food gone.\n\n(6,6) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (5,5), can I move to (6,6)?\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6), then R to (6,6) at turn 10, too late.\n\nOr from (5,5) move R to (6,5), then U to (6,6) at turn 10, late.\n\nAt turn 9, from position (4,5) or (5,5), I cannot reach (6,6) in one move; (6,6) is two moves away from (4,5) at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (4,5), (6,6) is at (6,6), distance |6-4| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, need 3 turns, turn 8,9,10 to reach, but turn 10 too late.\n\nIf at turn 8 I am at (4,5), move to (5,5) turn 9, then to (6,5) turn 10, then to (6,6) turn 11, gone.\n\nCannot reach (6,6) by turn 9 if I eat (2,3) late.\n\nIn the first approach, where I eat (2,3) at turn 0 and (3,5) at turn 3, then at turn 4 I am at (4,5) or something, and eat (6,6) at turn 7, which is before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to (6,6) first, I can eat at turn 6, then back for others.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move R to (4,3) but current direction L, move R is reverse, not allowed! Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nAt turn 0, direction L, so I can only move U, D, L.\n\nTo go right, I need to change direction.\n\nFor example, turn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat, now direction U.\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,4), no food, positions if length 1, after move U to (3,4), positions [(3,4)], then move R to (4,4), positions [(4,4)]\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (5,4), no food\n\nTurn 3: move R to (6,4), no food\n\nTurn 4: move U to (6,5), no food\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6), eat, score +1 at turn 5.\n\nThen I have (2,3) and (3,5) to eat.\n\n(3,5) can be eaten, from (6,6), but far.\n\nAt turn 5, life_span of (2,3) is 10-5=5, can be eaten by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5).\n\nFrom (6,6), positions after eating, [(6,6), (6,5)] length 2.\n\nThen go to (3,5) or (2,3).\n\n(3,5) is closer? From (6,6) to (3,5), |6-3| + |6-5| =3+1=4, but with snake.\n\nBut (3,5) might be eaten on the way.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (2,3) by turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: from (6,6), move L to (5,6), no food, positions [ (5,6), (6,6) ]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,6), no food, positions [ (4,6), (5,6) ]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,5), no food, positions [ (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5), but (3,5) has food, eat, score +1.\n\nBut (3,5) eaten at turn 9.\n\nThen (2,3) still uneaten, and at turn 9, life_span=1, can be eaten at turn 9? At turn 9, life_span=1, can be eaten during turn 9.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) at turn 9, positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] or something.\n\nBefore turn 9: positions [ (4,5), (4,6) ] head (4,5)\n\nMove to (3,5) with food, new head (3,5), and body the previous positions, so [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] since food eaten.\n\nThen to eat (2,3), from (3,5), I need to go to (2,3), which is adjacent? (3,5) to (2,3) is not adjacent; (2,3) is left and down.\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3), but that takes two more turns, turn 10 and 11.\n\nAt turn 10, (2,3) life_span=0? At turn 10, for (2,3), initial life 10, at turn 10, life_span=0, disappears, cannot eat.\n\nSo I miss (2,3).\n\nIf I go directly to (2,3) from (4,5) at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, positions [ (4,5), (4,6) ] head (4,5)\n\nMove to (3,5) but (3,5) has food? If not eaten, but in this sequence, not eaten yet.\n\nMove to (3,5) at turn 8 to eat? Turn 8: from (4,5) move L to (3,5), eat, score +1.\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,5) move to (2,3)? Not directly.\n\nMove L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3) at turn 11, late.\n\nCannot eat (2,3) if I go to (6,6) first.\n\nTherefore, to eat all foods, I should eat the closer foods first, especially (2,3) which is adjacent.\n\n(3,5) is also close.\n\nBut (2,3) can be eaten immediately.\n\nSo for long-term, eating (2,3) at turn 0 is better to ensure I don't miss it.\n\nThen I can eat (3,5) by turn 3 and (6,6) by turn 7.\n\nAll within life_span.\n\nTherefore, at turn 0, I should move L to eat (2,3).\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nSince I need to output multiple turns, I'll provide the actions for the first few turns towards this plan.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (2,4)  // to go towards (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4)  // now at (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,5) eat.  // eat second food\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,5)  // towards (6,6)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 5 or so.\n\nSince the format allows multiple, I can list until I eat all, but it might be long.\n\nPerhaps for the response, list the actions for turn 0 to, say, turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut thinking 5+ turns ahead, I should plan the actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer, I need to write the sequence.\n\nNow, for turn 0, action is L.\n\nThen based on state.\n\nBut since the state changes, I should specify the sequence assuming no changes.\n\nI think for this, I'll go with move L at turn 0.\n\nThen the next actions.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead. The current state at turn 0 has the snake at position (3,3) with direction left, and three positive food items: (2,3), (3,5), and (6,6), each with a life span of 10. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Opportunity**: The food at (2,3) is adjacent to the current head position (3,3) and can be eaten on turn 0 by moving left, providing an immediate score increase and growing the snake to length 2.\n- **Long-term Path**: After eating (2,3), the next closest food is at (3,5). A safe path to (3,5) involves moving up to (2,4) on turn 1, then right to (3,4) on turn 2, and finally up to (3,5) on turn 3 to eat it.\n- **Third Food (6,6)**: After eating (3,5), the snake can head towards (6,6) by moving right incrementally: to (4,5) on turn 4, (5,5) on turn 5, (6,5) on turn 6, and (6,6) on turn 7. This ensures (6,6) is eaten by turn 7, well within its life span (disappears after turn 9).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving left on turn 0 is safe as there is no body to collide with.\n  - The path avoids walls and the obstacle at (3,6). For instance, from (3,5), moving up is blocked by the obstacle, so moving right is chosen.\n  - No negative food is present, and tail reward danger is irrelevant initially.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has a life span of 10, disappearing after turn 9. Eating (2,3) on turn 0, (3,5) on turn 3, and (6,6) on turn 7 ensures all are consumed with a buffer.\n- **Sequence Efficiency**: This plan scores +1 on turn 0, +1 on turn 3, and +1 on turn 7 for a total score of 3. Alternative paths (e.g., going to (3,5) first) risk missing (2,3) or (6,6) due to life span constraints or increased snake length.\n\n### Planned Actions (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 0**: Move left (L) to (2,3) to eat the food immediately. This grows the snake to length 2 and starts scoring early.\n- **Turn 1**: Move up (U) to (2,4) to position for accessing (3,5). No food here, so no growth.\n- **Turn 2**: Move right (R) to (3,4). This avoids the body segment at (2,3) and aligns for the move to (3,5).\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food. Score increases to +2, snake grows to length 3.\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to begin heading towards (6,6). No food, so snake moves but does not grow.\n- **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (5,5) to continue towards (6,6). No food.\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (6,5) to approach (6,6). No food.\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to (6,6) to eat the food. Score increases to +3, snake grows to length 4.\n\nThis sequence eats all three foods by turn 7, maximizing the score while avoiding risks. The actions for turns 0-4 are critical for the short-term path, and turns 5-7 complete the long-term plan. Beyond turn 7, the snake can explore for potential new food or avoid hazards, but the given foods are all consumed.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 2: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 3: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because walls occupy x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so I can't move there.\n\nCurrent turn is t=1.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). So the snake has two segments, head and tail. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (2,3) from (3,3)? Positions are given as [(2,3), (3,3)], so head is (2,3), and the previous position was (3,3). Since head direction is L, it moved left from (3,3) to (2,3). So current direction is left.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so all are good to eat.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. Also, avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so accessible cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. That's 6x6 = 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSo free cells: all except (3,6).\n\nNow, snake is at (2,3) and (3,3). So cells occupied: (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nFood at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5; (6,6) at x=6,y=6; (6,4) at x=6,y=4.\n\nLife spans: (3,5) life 9, (6,6) life 9, (6,4) life 10. Since current turn is 1, and life span decreases each turn, including current, so:\n\n- (3,5) disappears after turn 9, so it lasts until turn 9.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, life span decreases to N - (t - t_spawn), I think.\n\nThe state says \"current turn t1=1\", and food has life span, so for food at (3,5), life span 9 at turn 1, so it will disappear after 9 turns from now? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at the turn when it spawns, life span is N, then next turn it becomes N-1, and so on, until 0, when it disappears.\n\nBut here, turn is 1, and life span is given, so for (3,5), life span 9 at turn 1, meaning it has 9 turns left including this one? Or after this turn?\n\nTypically, \"disappears after N turns\" means it will be there for N more turns.\n\nFor example, if life span is 9 at turn 1, then:\n\n- Turn 1: life span 9\n\n- Turn 2: 8\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: 1\n\n- Turn 10: disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 9, same.\n\n(6,4) life span 10, so disappears after turn 10.\n\nBut since we're at turn 1, we have time.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is left, I can go L, U, or D, but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I cannot move R.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left).\n\nL would be continuing left, to (1,3).\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2).\n\nNow, let's see what's around.\n\nFirst, check for immediate dangers.\n\nIf I go L to (1,3): is (1,3) valid? x=1, y=3. Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is ok, y=3 is between 1 and 6. No obstacle mentioned except (3,6), so (1,3) should be free, but snake body is at (3,3), not (1,3), so no collision. Also, walls are borders, so x=1,y=3 should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, U to (2,4): (2,4) should be free.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) should be free.\n\nNow, food locations: (3,5) is above, at y=5, x=3; (6,6) is far; (6,4) at x=6,y=4.\n\nSince snake is small, only two segments, eating food will increase length to 3.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,3), and head is at (2,3), so they are adjacent horizontally. Tail is at (3,3), no food there; food is elsewhere. So no issue now.\n\nThe tail cell doesn't have food; food is at (3,5), etc.\n\nNow, let's plan moves.\n\nI should aim for the food, but with survival in mind.\n\nFirst, let's list possible paths to each food.\n\nFood at (3,5): from head (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), then need to go to (3,5). From (2,4), to (3,5) is right, which is possible.\n\nDistance: (2,3) to (3,5) is |2-3|=1 in x, |3-5|=2 in y, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6): |2-6|=4, |3-6|=3, distance 7.\n\nTo (6,4): |2-6|=4, |3-4|=1, distance 5.\n\nBut with obstacles and snake body, but body is small.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5).\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, (3,5) is food.\n\nSo if I go to (3,5), I need to be careful around that area.\n\nNow, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible sequences.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so paths might be blocked later.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3). After move, tail will move, so if I don't eat, tail moves away, snake stays length 2.\n\nIf I eat food, length becomes 3, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, I think.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so you grow by one.\n\nBut here, it says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAnd movement: each turn, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next segment or stays if grew.\n\nSpecifically, for eating: if head moves onto food, you eat it, and tail does not move, so length increases.\n\nOtherwise, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the cell it was pointing to, so length same.\n\nIn this case, snake has segments: let's say positions: index 0 head, index 1 tail.\n\nAfter move: if no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves off its position, so the new positions are [new_head, old_head].\n\nIf eat, head moves to food, tail stays, so new positions [new_head, old_head, old_tail] or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nCurrent positions: [head, tail] = [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nIf I move to a non-food cell, say (1,3) by L, then new head is (1,3), and tail moves to where head was, (2,3), so new snake: [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nIf I move to a food cell, say if (1,3) had food, but it doesn't, so for example, if I go to (3,5) which has food, but it's not adjacent, so I need multiple moves.\n\nSuppose I move to a cell with food: head moves to that cell, eats food, so the tail does not move, so new positions: [new_head] and the old body, so [ (food_cell), (2,3) ] and tail (3,3) remains, so snake becomes [ (food_cell), (2,3), (3,3) ], length 3.\n\nIf no eat, snake becomes [new_head, old_head], length same.\n\nIn this case, since tail was (3,3), it moves away only if no eat.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (2,3): L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option for turn 1.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,3)\n\n- (1,3) is empty, no food, so no eat. Snake becomes [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\n- Tail was (3,3), which is now vacated, so that cell is free.\n\n- Now head at (1,3), direction left (since I moved L).\n\nThen for turn 2, I can go L, U, D, but not R.\n\nL to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nU to (1,4)\n\nD to (1,2)\n\nR to (2,3) but (2,3) is now the body, so if I go R, head to (2,3), which is occupied by body, collision.\n\nPositions after turn 1: head (1,3), body (2,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,3) and (2,3)\n\nIf I move R to (2,3), it's the body segment, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to wall or obstacle.\n\nSo from (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3) invalid, R to (2,3) invalid. So only U or D.\n\nNow, if I go U to (1,4), then snake [(1,4), (1,3)] after move, since no eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,5), (2,4), or (0,4) invalid, etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is for turn 1 decision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D from (1,3) to (1,2), similar.\n\nBut moving to (1,3) seems to corner myself on the left side, with only up and down moves.\n\nx=1 is left border, so from (1,y), I can only go U, D, or R if possible, but R might be body.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (1,3), body is at (2,3), so R is blocked, so I can only go U or D, effectively stuck in a corridor.\n\nThen I have to move up or down, and eventually might have issues if I go to y=1 or y=6, borders.\n\ny=1 and y=6 are walls? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, but y=1 is adjacent to wall y=0, but y=1 is playable.\n\nMoving to (1,3) seems risky because it reduces mobility.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is empty, no food, so snake becomes [(2,4), (2,3)] after move. Tail (3,3) vacated.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction up.\n\nThen possible moves: U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nU to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4)\n\nAll should be free. (2,5) is free, (1,4) free, (3,4) free? (3,4) is not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nThen from there, I can reach food.\n\nFor example, food at (3,5) is close. From (2,4) to (3,5) is one step right and up, but diagonal not allowed, so need to go to (3,4) or (2,5) first.\n\n(2,4) to (3,5): can go R to (3,4) first, then from (3,4) to (3,5) U.\n\nSimilarly, can go U to (2,5) then R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is food.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) empty, no food, snake [(2,2), (2,3)], head down direction.\n\nThen moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2), not U.\n\n(2,1) is y=1, which is ok, not wall. Wall y=0, so y=1 is free.\n\n(1,2) free, (3,2) free.\n\nFood is not close, except (6,4) is at y=4, so down might be away.\n\nBut (6,4) is at x=6,y=4, from (2,2) it's far.\n\nNow, compare to moving up, which is towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, head at (2,3), so moving U to (2,4) gets closer.\n\nMoving D to (2,2) gets farther.\n\nMoving L to (1,3) is neutral but risky.\n\nSo moving U seems better to reach food faster.\n\nBut I need to think long-term survival.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,5) has life span 9, so plenty of time, but I should eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, others have life 9 and 10.\n\nBut since snake is short, I can eat multiple.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating (3,5), snake grows, and I need to avoid collisions.\n\nAlso, the area around (3,5): (3,6) is obstacle, so above (3,5) is blocked.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can go U, but (3,6) is wall, so U invalid.\n\nCan go L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4).\n\nR to (4,5) might be ok.\n\nBut let's plan sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 1, if I go U to (2,4), no eat.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), I can go to (3,4) R, or (2,5) U, or (1,4) L.\n\nNow, (3,4) is empty, no food.\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), then snake head to (3,4), body at (2,4), so positions [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,5) U, which has food.\n\nSo move U to (3,5), eat food, since head moves to (3,5), which has food, so eat, snake grows: new head (3,5), body (3,4) and (2,4), so positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction up.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (2,5)\n\nR to (4,5)\n\nD to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so collision.\n\nD to (3,4) is occupied by body segment, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, U invalid.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nL to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) should be free, assuming no one there.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nSay I go L to (2,5), then snake moves: since no eat, head to (2,5), tail moves to (3,4)? Positions: current [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move to (2,5), head to (2,5), no eat, so tail moves: the last segment (2,4) is tail, it moves off, so new positions: head (2,5), then the body segments: after head moves, the body follows, so new body: (3,5) becomes first body, (3,4) becomes second body? Let's index.\n\nAfter eating: positions [head, body1, body2] = [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nNow, if I move head to (2,5), which is not food, so no eat, tail (2,4) moves off, and body moves: the segment that was body1 (3,4) moves to where head was? Standard: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: new head position (2,5)\n\nThen body segment 1 (which was at (3,5)) moves to where head was? No.\n\nThe positions: let's think of the snake as a list: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: body (3,4), index 2: tail (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,5), head moves to (2,5), so new head (2,5)\n\nThen index 1 (body) moves to the previous position of index 0, which is (3,5)\n\nIndex 2 (tail) moves to the previous position of index 1, which is (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) was occupied by body, but when tail moves, it leaves that cell.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)? Let's see:\n\n- Head was at (3,5), moves to (2,5)\n\n- Body at (3,4) moves to where head was, (3,5)\n\n- Tail at (2,4) moves to where body was, (3,4)\n\nSo new snake: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nOccupied cells: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(3,5) has food, but food is eaten when head moves there, so after eating, the food is gone, so (3,5) is now snake body.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (3,5), the cell is snake head, no food.\n\nThen moving to (2,5), new head (2,5), body at (3,5), tail at (3,4)\n\nNow from (2,5), direction left (since from (3,5) to (2,5) is left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (2,4) but (2,4) is not occupied now? In new positions, (2,4) was tail and moved to (3,4), so (2,4) is free? Current occupied: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(2,4) is free, yes.\n\nSo from (2,5), can go U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), not R.\n\n(2,6) is y=6, which is adjacent to wall y=7? y=6 is playable, y=7 wall.\n\ny=6 is ok.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 1 decision.\n\nIf I move U on turn 1 to (2,4), I can then go to (3,4) and then to (3,5) to eat on turn 3.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4), no eat, snake [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,5), eat, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nThen I need to move to (2,5) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut at (3,5), I can only go L or R, since U blocked by wall, D blocked by body.\n\nD to (3,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo I must go L or R on next turn.\n\nNow, if I go L to (2,5), as above.\n\nOr R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut is this the best?\n\nI could go directly towards other food.\n\nBut (3,5) is close.\n\nAnother option: from (2,3), go U to (2,4), then on turn 2 go U to (2,5) instead of R.\n\nTurn 1: U to (2,4), snake [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5), no eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (3,5) R, since (3,5) is food, so on turn 3 move R to (3,5), eat, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 2: head (2,5), body (2,4)\n\nMove R to (3,5), which is food, so eat: head to (3,5), tail doesn't move, so new snake: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen same as before, head at (3,5), can go L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, collision, or R to (4,5), or U invalid, D to (3,4) which is not occupied? Occupied cells: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), so (3,4) is free.\n\nD to (3,4) is possible.\n\nFrom (3,5), D to (3,4) is down, to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, no body.\n\nIn positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\n(3,4) is not occupied, so I can move D to (3,4).\n\nThen snake moves to (3,4), no eat, so tail moves: new head (3,4), body moves to (3,5), tail moves to (2,5)? Positions: head to (3,4), body (2,5) moves to previous head (3,5), tail (2,4) moves to previous body (2,5), so new [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move, etc.\n\nBut at turn 3 after eating, from (3,5), I have options: L, R, or D if possible.\n\nIn the first sequence, when I went to (3,4) then to (3,5), from (3,5) I could only go L or R because D was body.\n\nIn second sequence, when I went to (2,5) then to (3,5), from (3,5) I can go D to (3,4) or R to (4,5), since L to (2,5) is body.\n\nD to (3,4) is free in this case.\n\nSo better to approach from below or side to have more escape routes.\n\nFor (3,5), since above is wall, below might be blocked by body after eating, so approaching from the left or right is better.\n\nIn general, for food at (3,5), it's better to come from (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5), but not from below if body is there.\n\nIn this case, since snake is short, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's think about other food.\n\nFood at (6,4) and (6,6) are on the right.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, (6,6) at y=6.\n\ny=6 is top row, wall at y=7, so y=6 is playable but border.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), but that's different.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nLong-term, I need to maximize score, so eat all food, but avoid dying.\n\nSince grid is small, 36 cells, snake grows, it might trap itself.\n\nBut I can plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,4) first, which is farther but has longer life span? (6,4) life span 10, (3,5) and (6,6) life 9, but all have many turns.\n\n(6,4) life 10 at turn 1, so disappears after turn 10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut (3,5) is closer.\n\nLet's consider the move down.\n\nIf I go D to (2,2) on turn 1.\n\nThen snake at (2,2), (2,3)\n\nThen I can go to (3,2) or (2,1) or (1,2).\n\nBut food is not near, so I might go towards (6,4).\n\nFor example, from (2,2) go R to (3,2), then to (4,2), etc, to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is at y=4, so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) go U to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, collision if I go back, but after move to (2,2), body at (2,3), so U to (2,3) is invalid.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nThen to reach (6,4), it might take many moves.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (1,3) is worse.\n\nSo moving up seems best to get to (3,5) quickly.\n\nThen after eating (3,5), I have a longer snake, and I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), after eating, I can go R to (4,5), then to (5,5), (6,5), then to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), (6,4) at (6,4).\n\nOr I can go down.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there might be risks of trapping.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is for turns starting from t1, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions for a sequence, but it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nLook at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't say how many, so I need to provide a sequence for the next few turns, say 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut since the game continues, I should provide actions for the immediate turns where I have a plan.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's assume I provide a sequence for 3-5 turns.\n\nFirst, on turn 1, move U to (2,4) seems good.\n\nThen turn 2, from (2,4), I can move to (3,4) to set up for (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,4), moving to (3,4) is R.\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 4, from (3,5), I need to move, say to (4,5) R or (2,5) L or (3,4) D.\n\nBut if I go D to (3,4), it might be free, depending on body.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4) — no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,4) — no eat, snake [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,5) — eat, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nNow on turn 4, from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) is free? Occupied: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), so (2,5) is free.\n\n- R to (4,5): (4,5) free\n\n- D to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, occupied, collision, invalid\n\n- U to (3,6): obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay I choose to go R to (4,5).\n\nThen move to (4,5), no food there, so no eat, tail moves: new head (4,5), body moves to (3,5), tail moves to (3,4)? Positions: head to (4,5), body (3,4) moves to previous head (3,5), tail (2,4) moves to previous body (3,4), so new snake [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\n(2,4) was tail, moved to (3,4), so (2,4) vacated.\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction right.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5), etc, towards (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,5), I can go right to (5,5), (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is below.\n\nBut let's see life spans.\n\nAt turn 4, life span of (3,5) was 9 at turn 1, so at turn 4, it has 9-3=6 left? Turn 1: life 9, turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, so still there but eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life 9 at turn 1, turn 4: 6 left.\n\n(6,4) life 10 at turn 1, turn 4: 7 left.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nNow, from (4,5), I can go to (6,6) via (5,5) and (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is not food, then to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is corner, x=6,y=6, which is right top corner.\n\nWalls at x=7,y=7, so from (6,6), possible moves: L to (5,6), D to (6,5), not R or U.\n\nSo it might be risky if snake is long.\n\nBut now snake is length 3.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), at (6,4), it can go L to (5,4), U to (6,5), D to (6,3), not R.\n\ny=3 is ok.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor turn 1, moving U seems good.\n\nBut I have another choice: from (2,3), I could go directly towards (6,4) or something, but it's farther.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving left or down has benefits, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no food under snake.\n\nCurrently, food at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4), all free.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not now.\n\nSo I think for turn 1, best to move U to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 2, move R to (3,4) to approach (3,5).\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 4, I need to move, say to (4,5) R.\n\nThen later to other food.\n\nBut since I need to output a sequence, I can do for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), move R to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the direction.\n\nAfter turn 3, head at (3,5), after eating, direction up (since moved U to get there).\n\nThen turn 4, move R to (4,5), so direction right.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about avoiding dead ends.\n\nFor example, after moving to (4,5), I can go towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so I might go down.\n\nBut (6,4) has longer life, but (6,6) might be eaten first.\n\nSince I'm at (4,5), (6,6) is closer in y, but x same distance.\n\n|4-6|=2 in x, |5-6|=1 in y, distance 3.\n\nTo (6,4): |4-6|=2, |5-4|=1, distance 3 same.\n\nBut (6,6) is corner, so might be riskier.\n\n(6,4) is not corner, can go down to y=3, etc.\n\nSo perhaps go to (6,4) first.\n\nBut I don't have to decide now.\n\nFor the sequence, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), I could move D to (4,4) to go towards (6,4), or R to (5,5) towards (6,6).\n\nBut let's see the state at turn 4.\n\nAfter turn 4 move to (4,5), no eat, snake positions.\n\nAfter turn 3: snake [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5), not food, so no eat, tail moves: new head (4,5), body (3,4) moves to (3,5), tail (2,4) moves to (3,4), so new snake [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction right.\n\nThen turn 5, possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, or R.\n\n(4,6): y=6, free.\n\n(4,4): free.\n\n(5,5): free.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4), then towards (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (4,4) to (6,4) is right two steps.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think for now, moving U on turn 1 is fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought about moving directly to (2,5) but on turn 1 from (2,3), I can only go to (2,4), not directly to (2,5).\n\nSo U to (2,4) is the first step.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but all food is positive.\n\nAnother point: in the food list, it says (3,5,9,1) etc, so value 1, positive.\n\nSo I think U is good.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 blocked.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,6), so (3,6) blocked.\n\nSnake: (2,3) head, (3,3) tail.\n\nFood: (3,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n\nNow, if I move D to (2,2), then I might go to (3,2), (4,2), etc, but (6,4) is at y=4, so I need to go up later.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) go R to (3,2), then to (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), then U to (6,3), (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, moving left is worse.\n\nSo U is better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (6,4) directly, but it's farther.\n\nManhattan distance from (2,3) to (6,4) is |2-6|=4, |3-4|=1, total 5, while to (3,5) is |2-3|=1, |3-5|=2, total 3, so closer.\n\nAnd (3,5) life shorter? No, both have 9 left, (6,4) has 10, but at turn 1, I can eat (3,5) by turn 3, so better to eat it.\n\nThen I have more score.\n\nAfter eating, snake longer, but still manageable.\n\nSo I think for turn 1, move U.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can plan:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 3: U (to (3,5), eat)\n\nThen for turn 4, from (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5), move R to (5,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nTo be consistent, say R to (5,5) towards (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is corner, so better to go to (6,4) first.\n\nFrom (4,5), go D to (4,4), then R to (5,4), R to (6,4) to eat.\n\n(6,4) is food, so when I move to (6,4), I eat it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's not specify turn 5 yet.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 4 or 5.\n\nSince the state is turn 1, I need to output actions starting turn 1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSo for t1=1, I can do:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nAnd that's for 3 turns, or add more.\n\nTo think ahead, I can add turn 4: R\n\nBut turn 4 depends.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nAnother sequence: from turn 2, after U to (2,4), I could go U to (2,5) instead of R to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 3 move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), it might be free.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTurn 1: U to (2,4), snake [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5), no eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,5), eat, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nNow at (3,5), can move D to (3,4) or R to (4,5) or L to (2,5) invalid.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is free? Occupied: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), so (3,4) free, yes.\n\nMove D to (3,4), no eat, then snake: head to (3,4), body (2,5) moves to (3,5), tail (2,4) moves to (2,5), so new [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move, etc.\n\nBut in this case, when I moved to (2,5) on turn 2, (2,5) might be closer to other things, but not necessary.\n\nI think the first sequence is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nAnd for turn 4, since I need to output more, say R to (4,5)\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 3 U to (3,5), head at (3,5), then turn 4 move R to (4,5)\n\nSimilarly, turn 5 move to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut to be precise, let's output for 4 turns.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output can be for the actions I decide.\n\nI think outputting for 3 or 4 turns is ok.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nPerhaps I can do:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nBut turn 4 R from (3,5) to (4,5)\n\nYes.\n\nThen the snake is at (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo avoid the corner, on turn 4 from (3,5) go L to (2,5), but (2,5) might not be towards other food.\n\n(2,5) is left, while other food is right.\n\nSo better to go right.\n\nSo I think U, R, U, R for turns 1-4.\n\nBut turn 1 U, turn 2 R, turn 3 U, turn 4 R.\n\nNow, directions: for turn 4, moving R from (3,5) to (4,5), which is right.\n\nNow, in terms of head direction, but I don't need to track for the answer, just the action.\n\nSo for the box.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 1 to 5). The plan focuses on safely eating the positive food at (3,5) by turn 3, as it is the closest and most accessible food with a life span of 9 (disappearing after turn 9). After eating, the sequence avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to pursue other food (e.g., (6,4) or (6,6)) in subsequent turns. Key considerations:\n\n- **Immediate move (turn 1)**: Move up (U) to (2,4) to avoid the left border (which reduces mobility) and move closer to (3,5). This also keeps the center open for future options.\n- **Turn 2**: Move right (R) to (3,4) to directly approach (3,5) without trapping the snake.\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food, increasing the snake length to 3. This is safe as the body is not blocking the escape routes at this point.\n- **Escape after eating (turn 4)**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to avoid the body segment at (3,4) and the obstacle at (3,6). This move ensures the snake can access the right side of the grid for future food.\n- **Long-term positioning (turn 5)**: Move down (D) to (4,4) to head toward (6,4) (which has a longer life span of 10) while avoiding the top-right corner (6,6) for now, as corners increase collision risk with a growing snake.\n\nThis sequence eats one food by turn 3, gains +1 score, and sets up for further food collection. It avoids all walls, obstacles, and body collisions. Beyond turn 5, the snake should prioritize (6,4) due to its life span and safer access, then (6,6), while constantly evaluating new food spawns and risks.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: R\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 2.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), body at (2,3). So the snake is two segments long, moving Up. That means it's going towards increasing y, so from (2,3) to (2,4) is up.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 8, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (6,4) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span is given as the remaining turns before it disappears. So for (3,5), life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 more turns, including this one. Similarly for others.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake head at (2,4), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But I have to avoid instant reverse. Since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down next, because that would be opposite.\n\nInstant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down.\n\nSimilarly, if I move, the direction for the next turn will be set based on what I do.\n\nNow, let's map the grid mentally.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (2,4), body (2,3). So the tail is at (2,3).\n\nFood at: (3,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n\n(3,5) is one step right and one step up from head? Head is at (2,4). So to (3,5): x+1, y+1, so diagonal, not adjacent directly.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (2,4):\n\n- Up: (2,5)\n\n- Down: (2,3) but that's the body, and moving down would be into the body, but since it's the tail, and tail will move, it might be safe? Let's see collision rules.\n\nCollision: body collision kills, except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, because the tail will move forward. So if I move to where the tail is now, it should be safe, because after I move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, moving Down to (2,3) should be safe because (2,3) is the tail, and after moving, the snake grows or not, but since I'm not eating, length unchanged, so tail moves to where body was, but since only one body segment, let's think.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,4), (2,3)] head and body.\n\nIf I move Down to (2,3), new head position is (2,3). But (2,3) was occupied by the tail. After move, since I didn't eat, the tail moves away to the previous position, but the body was at (2,3), which becomes the new tail? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard snake movement: when you move, the head goes to a new cell, and if no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (2,4), body (2,3) — so segment 0: (2,4), segment 1: (2,3)\n\nAfter moving Down to (2,3): new head position is (2,3). But (2,3) was segment 1. Since no food eaten, the tail (segment 1) is removed, so new positions: head at (2,3), and body? Only one segment, so tail is gone? Snake should have one segment after move? No.\n\nStart with two segments: head and one body/tail.\n\nAfter moving without eating: head moves to new position, tail position is vacated, so snake has head at new position, and the previous head becomes the body.\n\nSo before: positions [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n\nMove to new cell C.\n\nIf C not food, then new positions: [C, A] with C head, A now body/tail. B is removed.\n\nIn this case: before: head A=(2,4), tail B=(2,3)\n\nMove Down to C=(2,3)\n\nC is (2,3), which was B, the tail.\n\nAfter move: new head is C=(2,3), and since no food, tail B is removed, so new body is A, which is (2,4). So positions: [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nBut (2,3) was tail, now head, and (2,4) was head, now body.\n\nNo collision because the cell (2,3) was occupied but by tail, which moves away.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a cell with food, I eat, so tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n\nNow, in this position, adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,5)\n\n- Down: (2,3) — but (2,3) is currently occupied by tail, but as above, moving there is safe.\n\n- Left: (1,4)\n\n- Right: (3,4)\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 borders, so Left to (1,4) is within bounds since x=1>0, y=4 between 0 and 7.\n\nRight to (3,4), x=3<7, y=4 ok.\n\nUp to (2,5), y=5<7, ok.\n\nDown to (2,3), y=3>0, ok.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n(3,5): that's at (3,5)\n\n(6,6) and (6,4)\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is same y as head but different x.\n\nNow, life span: for food at (3,5), life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns including this one, so at turn t=2, life span 8, so it will be gone after turn 9? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will last for L turns, disappearing at the end of turn t+L-1 or something.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists for N more turns, including turn t. So at the start of turn t, it has N turns left. After N turns, it's gone.\n\nSo for (3,5): at turn 2, life span 8, so it will be present until turn 9 (since 2+8-1=9? Let's think.\n\nTurn 2: life span 8, after turn 2, it decreases to 7.\n\nAfter turn 3: 6, ..., after turn 9: 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten on turns 2 through 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 8, same.\n\n(6,4) life span 9, so until turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to plan for multiple turns. Since the snake is short, I should eat food to grow, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see what moves are possible now at turn 2.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R, but D is down, which is opposite to current direction Up? Current head direction is Up, so I cannot move Down because it's instant reverse.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so for the next move (turn 2), I cannot move Down.\n\nSo possible moves: Up, Left, Right.\n\nNow, evaluate each:\n\n- Up: to (2,5). Is this safe? (2,5) is empty, I think. No walls, no snake body except tail, but tail is at (2,3), not here. Walls: borders and (3,6), not (2,5). So safe.\n\n- Left: to (1,4). (1,4) is within grid, x=1>0, y=4, no walls, no obstacle mentioned except borders and (3,6), so should be safe.\n\n- Right: to (3,4). Similarly, (3,4) is not wall, not obstacle, not snake body.\n\nNow, food: no food at these cells, so no eating.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is adjacent? From (2,4), (3,5) is up-right, not directly adjacent; adjacent are (2,5), (3,4), (2,3), (1,4). (3,5) is not adjacent, so I can't reach it in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) and (6,4) are far.\n\nSo for turn 2, no food reachable in one move.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,3), head at (2,4), so they are adjacent vertically. But (2,3) has no food, I think. Food positions are given, none at (2,3), so no issue.\n\nNow, let's plan a path to food.\n\nClosest food: (3,5) is at distance? Manhattan: |3-2| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2, so two moves away, e.g., right then up, or up then right.\n\n(6,4) is |6-2| + |4-4| = 4 + 0 = 4, so four moves away.\n\n(6,6) is |6-2| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nSo (3,5) is closest.\n\nBut life span is 8 for (3,5), plenty of time.\n\nNow, (6,4) has longer life span 9.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which might affect paths to (3,5) or (6,6).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is above (3,5), but since we move to cells, not an issue directly.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I need to choose a move.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), I can then go to (3,5) next turn, since (3,5) is up from (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5), I can go right to (3,5).\n\nIf I go left to (1,4), I'm farther.\n\nBut I should consider the whole path and safety.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible sequences.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so paths might change.\n\nCurrent length 2.\n\nIf I eat positive food, length becomes 3.\n\nNow, let's list the grid state.\n\nI'll sketch a small grid.\n\nRows y=7 to y=0, but usually y=0 bottom or top? In coordinates, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but in the positions, snake head at (2,4), body (2,3), so (2,3) has lower y, so y=3 is below y=4, so increasing y is up.\n\nSo y from 0 (bottom) to 7 (top).\n\nx from 0 (left) to 7 (right).\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6)\n\nSnake: head (2,4), tail (2,3)\n\nFood: (3,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n\nNow, cells: let's list free cells.\n\nBut for now, possible moves from (2,4):\n\n- U: (2,5) - free\n\n- D: not allowed, reverse\n\n- L: (1,4) - free\n\n- R: (3,4) - free\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is not wall, not snake, not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, if I move to (3,4) at turn 2, then at turn 3, head at (3,4), direction from (2,4) to (3,4) is Right, so current direction Right.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,5) Up, since (3,5) is food.\n\n(3,5) has food, value +1.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 3, I eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n\nNew positions: before move, turn 2: head (2,4), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,4) at turn 2: new head (3,4), body (2,4) [previous head], tail (2,3) removed? Positions: after move without eat: [ (3,4), (2,4) ] head at (3,4), body at (2,4)\n\nThen at turn 3, move to (3,5): (3,5) has food, so eat, grow. New head at (3,5), body remains, tail not removed, so new positions: [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] length 3.\n\nDirection: from (3,4) to (3,5) is Up.\n\nLife span of (3,5) decreases each turn, but since eaten at turn 3, it's gone.\n\nBut at turn 2, when I move, (3,5) still has life span 8, but after turn 2, it decreases to 7, and at turn 3, I can eat it if I go there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5) at turn 2, then at turn 3, I can go right to (3,5), same thing.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), snake is at (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,5): direction Up.\n\nCan go U, D, L, R, but no reverse? Current direction Up, so cannot move Down.\n\nPossible: Up to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,6), so cannot go there.\n\nLeft to (2,5)? (2,5) is free? At turn 3, after move, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\n(2,5) is not occupied, I think. Previously at turn 2, if I went to (2,5), but in this path, I didn't.\n\nIn this sequence: at turn 2, I went to (3,4), then turn 3 to (3,5).\n\nSo at turn 3, cells: (3,5) head, (3,4) body, (2,4) tail.\n\nAdjacent to head: Up: (3,6) obstacle, cannot go.\n\nDown: (3,4) but (3,4) is body, not tail; tail is at (2,4). (3,4) is the body segment, so if I move Down to (3,4), that's collision, because it's not the tail; it's the body.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail cell when moving to it.\n\nHere, (3,4) is a body segment, not the tail, so moving to (3,4) would be collision.\n\nLeft: (2,5) — x=2,y=5, which should be free? No walls, no obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Snake has (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), so (2,5) is empty.\n\nRight: (4,5) — also free.\n\nBut current direction is Up, so I can move Up, Left, Right, but Up is blocked, so only Left or Right.\n\nDown is opposite, cannot.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5).\n\nIf I go Left to (2,5), that's fine.\n\nOr Right to (4,5).\n\nNow, back to turn 2 choices.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) at turn 2, then turn 3 to (3,5) to eat, then at turn 3 I have to move Left or Right from (3,5).\n\nBut (3,6) is blocked, so I can't go Up.\n\nNow, another choice: at turn 2, if I go Up to (2,5), then at turn 3, I can go Right to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen after eating, head at (3,5), body (2,5) and tail (2,4)? Let's see.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5). Before: positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nAfter move to (2,5): new positions [(2,5), (2,4)] since no eat.\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,5), which has food, eat, grow. New positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] length 3.\n\nDirection: from (2,5) to (3,5) is Right.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves: Up to (3,6) obstacle, cannot.\n\nDown to (3,4), which is free? Currently no snake there, and not obstacle.\n\n(3,4) is empty now.\n\nLeft to (2,5), but (2,5) is body, since positions (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), so (2,5) is body segment, moving left to (2,5) would be collision.\n\nRight to (4,5), free.\n\nDown to (3,4), free.\n\nCurrent direction Right, so I can move U, D, R, but U blocked, so D or R? Directions: from current direction Right, I can move Up, Down, Right (since Left is opposite? Current direction is the direction the head is facing.\n\nHead direction is based on last move.\n\nAt turn 3, after moving from (2,5) to (3,5), direction is Right.\n\nSo for next move, turn 4, possible moves: Up, Down, Right (since Left is opposite to Right).\n\nCannot move Left.\n\nNow, from (3,5), Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5).\n\nIf I go Down to (3,4), safe.\n\nOr Right to (4,5).\n\nIn both cases, after eating at (3,5), I can move away.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I went directly to (3,4) then (3,5), at turn 3 I could go Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) might be safer or not.\n\nNow, but I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is other food: (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at same y=4, but x=6.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block paths.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, since grid is small, I should avoid trapping myself.\n\nCurrently, with length 2, I have space.\n\nBut after eating, length 3, still ok.\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (6,4), which is closer in y, but x far.\n\nManhattan distance to (6,4) from (2,4) is 4, as |6-2|=4, |4-4|=0.\n\nTo (3,5) is 2.\n\n(6,6) is 6 away.\n\n(6,4) has life span 9, so can wait.\n\nBut I should go for (3,5) first since it's closer and might be riskier later? No, life span 8, so not urgent.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it soon to grow, which might help with future food.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (3,5), the snake is around (3,5), and (3,6) is blocked, so I have to go left or right or down.\n\nDown to (3,4) might be ok.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the tail position.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), tail is at (2,4) or (2,4) depending on path.\n\nIn first path, if I go via (3,4), tail at (2,4); if via (2,5), tail at (2,4) same.\n\nPositions: after eating at (3,5), in both cases, tail is at (2,4).\n\nThen when I move away, tail moves.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I have three choices.\n\nLet's consider moving to (3,4) at turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, move to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 3, head at (3,5), direction Up or Right? When I move from (3,4) to (3,5), that's Up, so direction Up.\n\nThen at turn 3, after move, direction Up.\n\nThen for turn 4, I can move Left, Right, or Up, but Up blocked, so Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5).\n\nSay I go Right to (4,5) for example.\n\nThen turn 4, move to (4,5), no food, so positions: new head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)? Before move: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat: new positions [(4,5), (3,5)] and tail (2,4) removed? Standard: head moves to (4,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (2,4) removed, so new positions [(4,5), (3,5)] length 2? But I just grew to 3, then moved without eating, so back to length 2? That can't be right.\n\nWhen you move without eating, the tail is removed, so length decreases only if no food.\n\nAfter eating at turn 3, length 3: positions A=(3,5), B=(3,4), C=(2,4) with A head, C tail.\n\nAt turn 4, move to new cell, say (4,5).\n\n(4,5) no food, so new head at (4,5), new body: previous head A=(3,5), and tail C removed, so new positions: [(4,5), (3,5)] length 2.\n\nYes, so if I don't eat, length decreases. But I ate at turn 3, so for one move, length is 3, then if I don't eat at turn 4, it goes back to 2.\n\nThat seems odd, but in snake, when you eat, you grow, and length stays until you don't eat and tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, after eating at turn 3, length 3. Then at turn 4, if I move to a cell with no food, tail moves, so length back to 2. But that means I lost the growth? No, the growth happens when you eat, so after eating, length increases, and then when you move without eating, the tail moves, so length remains the same if no food, but when you eat, you don't move tail, so length increases.\n\nClarify:\n\n- When you move to a cell with no food: head moves to new cell, tail is removed (so length decreases by 1? No.\n\nStart with length L.\n\nAfter moving to no food: head to new cell, the previous head becomes part of body, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake has the same number of segments, but shifted. Length remains L.\n\nFor example, initial: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T] length N.\n\nMove to new cell C, no food: new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed, so still N segments.\n\nIf C has food: new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so length N+1.\n\nIn my earlier: at turn 3 after eating, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] length 3.\n\nAt turn 4, move to (4,5) no food: new head (4,5), new positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] because previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (2,4) is removed, so segments: new head (4,5), body (3,5), and (3,4) is also body? Positions are [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] so head at (4,5), body at (3,5) and (3,4), tail at (3,4)? No, the last segment is tail.\n\nList: index 0: head (4,5), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,4) tail.\n\nSo length 3 still, because when moving without eating, tail is removed, but since there was a body, the second last becomes tail.\n\nIn this case, from length 3, after move no eat, still length 3? No.\n\nBefore move: segments: S0 = (3,5) head, S1 = (3,4), S2 = (2,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no food: new head at (4,5), and S0 becomes body, so new S0 = (4,5) head, S1 = (3,5) body, and S2 is removed, but S1 was (3,4), no.\n\nThe body segments shift: the new body includes the previous head and all but the tail.\n\nAfter move: new head at C, then the previous positions except the tail are kept, so new body is [previous head, previous body except last?].\n\nStandard: the snake moves forward, so the new head is at C, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo S0 new = C\n\nS1 new = S0 old\n\nS2 new = S1 old\n\n...\n\nUp to the tail, which is removed if no eat.\n\nWith eat, tail not removed, new segment added.\n\nIn this case, length 3: positions P0, P1, P2 with P0 head, P2 tail.\n\nMove to C, no eat: new positions: C (new head), P0 (new body), P1 (new tail). P2 is removed.\n\nSo from three segments, after move no eat, new segments: C, P0, P1 — so still three segments? P1 was body, now tail.\n\nExample: before: [ (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) ] P0=(3,5), P1=(3,4), P2=(2,4)\n\nMove to C=(4,5) no food: new head C=(4,5), then new P0 = (4,5), new P1 = P0 old = (3,5), new P2 = P1 old = (3,4) and P2 old removed.\n\nSo positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] so head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4). Length still 3.\n\nBut P2 new is (3,4), which was P1 old.\n\nAnd P2 old (2,4) is removed.\n\nSo length remains the same when no food eaten.\n\nWhen food eaten, length increases.\n\nIn this case, after eating at turn 3, length 3. At turn 4, move to no food, length still 3.\n\nIf I move to food, length increases.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nAt turn 2, I can choose to go to (3,4) or (2,5) or (1,4).\n\nGoing to (3,4) allows me to eat at (3,5) next turn.\n\nSimilarly, going to (2,5) allows me to eat at (3,5) next turn.\n\nGoing to (1,4) takes me away.\n\nSo for short-term score, going towards (3,5) is good.\n\nBut let's see if there's danger.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), as above, I have to move Left or Right from (3,5) since Up blocked.\n\nIf I go Left to (2,5), for example.\n\nAt turn 3, after eating at (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] or [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] depending on path.\n\nIn the first case, if I went to (3,4) then (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nThen move Left to (2,5): (2,5) is free, no food, so new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nLength 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone via (2,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)], then move say Down to (3,4) or Right.\n\nBut in both, after eating, I can explore.\n\nNow, there is food at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is on the same row y=4.\n\nFrom current position, to go to (6,4), I need to move right.\n\nBut if I eat (3,5) first, I might go there later.\n\nBut (6,4) has life span 9, so at turn 2, life span 9, can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 8.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect going to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at top-right.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should plan to eat all food, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently not the case.\n\nNow, at turn 2, if I go Left to (1,4), then I am moving away from food, which might not be good for scoring.\n\nSimilarly, going Up to (2,5) or Right to (3,4) both lead to eating (3,5) next turn.\n\nBut let's see which one is better for future.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) at turn 2, then to (3,5) at turn 3, then at turn 3 I am at (3,5) with direction Up, and I can only go Left or Right.\n\nIf I go Left to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction Left (since from (3,5) to (2,5) is Left).\n\nThen I can go Up, Down, Left, but not Right (reverse).\n\nFrom (2,5), Up to (2,6), Down to (2,4) but (2,4) is where tail was, but currently, positions after move: after moving to (2,5), positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] so (2,4) is free now.\n\nDown to (2,4) is possible.\n\nLeft to (1,5), Right not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if I go Right from (3,5) to (4,5), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is on y=4.\n\nFrom (2,4) or (3,4), it's straight right, but there might be walls or obstacles.\n\nGrid is open except borders and (3,6).\n\nTo go to (6,4), I can move right along y=4.\n\nCells: from x=3 to x=6, y=4: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut at turn 2, if I go to (3,4), then at turn 3 I go to (3,5), so (3,4) is body.\n\nThen later, I can go down to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut let's think about moving directly to (6,4) without eating (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is closer, so better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it, it might disappear later, but life span 8, so not soon.\n\nBut to maximize score, eat sooner.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, it might be harder to move, but here only 3 segments.\n\nAnother food at (6,6), which is at (6,6).\n\nTo go there, from (3,5), if I go right to (4,5), then to (5,5), (6,5), then up to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) has life span 8, same as (3,5).\n\nNow, at turn 2, I think it's safe to go towards (3,5).\n\nBut which way: via (3,4) or via (2,5).\n\nIf I go via (3,4), then after eating at (3,5), I am at (3,5) with (3,6) blocked, so I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go via (2,5), same thing.\n\nBut if I go via (2,5), at turn 2 I move to (2,5), then turn 3 to (3,5), then at turn 3, head at (3,5) with direction Right (since from (2,5) to (3,5) is Right).\n\nThen I can go Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5), since Up blocked, Left not allowed (opposite to Right).\n\nCurrent direction Right, so cannot move Left.\n\nSo only Down or Right.\n\nDown to (3,4) is free, or Right to (4,5).\n\nIf I go Down to (3,4), then positions: after move, new head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)? Before move: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move to (3,4): (3,4) no food? (3,4) had no food initially, but after moves, might change, but at turn 3, (3,4) should be free or not.\n\nIn this sequence: at turn 2, I moved to (2,5), so (2,5) occupied, (2,4) body.\n\nAt turn 3, I move to (3,5) and eat, so (3,5) occupied, positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen at turn 4, I move to (3,4), which is empty, no food, so new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)? New positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] with (2,4) removed.\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is now head.\n\nFrom here, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), so from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) from (6,4) I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nAt turn 2, life span of (3,5) is 8, so I can eat it at turn 3.\n\n(6,4) life span 9, so at turn 2, it has 9 turns left, can be eaten until turn 10.\n\n(6,6) life span 8, until turn 9.\n\nSo no urgency.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, let's assume I eat (3,5) at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 4, I need to move to another cell.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is closer from current position.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (6,4) is 4 steps, but after eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), then to (6,4) is |6-3| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps, but not direct.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (6,4): I can go down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), so 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6): from (3,5) to (6,6): right to (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then up to (6,6), 4 moves.\n\nBut (6,6) has obstacle at (3,6), but (3,6) is not on the path directly.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I think I should go towards (3,5).\n\nNow, between going to (3,4) or (2,5), let's see which one has better future options.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) at turn 2, then turn 3 to (3,5), then I can go left to (2,5) or right to (4,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,5) at turn 2, then turn 3 to (3,5), then I can go down to (3,4) or right to (4,5).\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut if I go to (3,4) first, then at turn 3 after eating, if I go left to (2,5), head at (2,5), and tail is at (3,4) or something.\n\nLet's simulate the grid after a few turns.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might make the top row risky.\n\ny=6 has (3,6) blocked, so from y=5, I cannot go up to y=6 at x=3.\n\nBut at other x, it's fine.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, the grid has borders, so I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nBut with short snake, it's ok.\n\nAnother point: food can spawn under body, but here no food under body.\n\nFor turn 2, I think moving to (3,4) is fine, or to (2,5).\n\nBut let's check if moving to (3,4) is safe.\n\n(3,4) is adjacent, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is safe.\n\n(1,4) is safe but away from food.\n\nSo I should go to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nPerhaps (3,4) is better because it's closer to (6,4) for future.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go right.\n\nFrom (2,5), I am at y=5, higher.\n\nBut (6,4) is at y=4.\n\nSo from (3,4) after eating, I can go directly right.\n\nFrom (2,5), I need to go down first.\n\nBut minor difference.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6), which is at y=6.\n\nBut (3,6) blocked, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, to go to (6,6), from (3,5), I can go right to (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then up to (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is free, then (6,6) food.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) etc.\n\nBut let's not optimize too much.\n\nI think for turn 2, I can move Right to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 3, move Up to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 3, after eating, I need to move for turn 4.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction Up, I can go Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5).\n\nSay I go Right to (4,5) for exploration.\n\nThen turn 4, at (4,5), no food, positions: from after turn 3: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] after eating.\n\nMove to (4,5) no food: new positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nDirection from (3,5) to (4,5) is Right, so current direction Right.\n\nThen turn 5, I can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nFor example, to (6,6), I can go to (5,5) then (6,5) then (6,6).\n\n(6,6) has life span 8, at turn 2, so at turn 5, how many turns left?\n\nTurn 2: life span 8 for (6,6), so after turn 2, life span 7, turn 3:6, turn 4:5, turn 5:4, so still 4 turns left at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 9 at turn 2, at turn 5: after turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, so 5 turns left.\n\nPlenty.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should be the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe format is: for turn t1, action; turn t1+1, action; and so on.\n\nBut how many turns to output? It doesn't specify, but I think I need to provide a sequence for the next few turns, say 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state might change, so perhaps for the immediate turns.\n\nSince it's a simulation, I can plan a path.\n\nBut to be practical, I'll plan to eat (3,5) first, then head towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is closer to the current area.\n\nFrom (4,5), to (6,4): I can go down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), (6,4).\n\nOr directly.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 2.\n\nI think moving Right to (3,4) at turn 2 is a good start.\n\nThen turn 3, move Up to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (3,5), I need to choose to go Left or Right.\n\nTo go towards (6,4), going Right might be better.\n\nSo go Right to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5), direction Right, I can go Down to (4,4) to get closer to y=4.\n\nOr Right to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), so from (4,5), going Down to (4,4) is good.\n\nThen from (4,4), go Right to (5,4), then (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, for (6,6), I can go later.\n\nBut (6,6) life span might be shorter.\n\nAt turn 2, (6,6) life span 8, (6,4) life span 9.\n\nBut both have time.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat (3,5), then (6,4), then (6,6) if possible.\n\nBut after eating (6,4), I can go to (6,6).\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I am near the tail with food.\n\nBut not now.\n\nAlso, food under body: but here no.\n\nFor turn 2, I'll go Right to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 3, Up to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 4, Right to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 5, Down to (4,4) to go towards (6,4).\n\nThen turn 6, Right to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 7, Right to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 7, (6,4) life span: at turn 2, 9, so turn 3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, so still present.\n\nSimilarly, during this, the snake grows.\n\nBut at turn 4, when I move to (4,5), no food, so length remains 3.\n\nThen at turn 5, to (4,4), no food, length 3.\n\nTurn 6 to (5,4), no food, length 3.\n\nTurn 7 to (6,4), eat, length 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) life span at turn 7: from turn 2 life 8, after 5 turns (turn 3 to 7), life decreases to 8-5=3? Turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, so at turn 7, life span 3, so I can eat at turn 7,8,9.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) at turn 7, head at (6,4), then I can go Up to (6,5), then to (6,6) to eat.\n\n(6,5) might have no food, then to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is food, so eat at turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut life span 3 at turn 7, so can be eaten on turn 7,8,9.\n\nTurn 7: if I go directly to (6,6), but from (6,4), (6,6) is two steps up, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent are (6,5), (5,4), etc.\n\nSo need to go to (6,5) first, then (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (6,5) at turn 8, then to (6,6) at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, life span: from turn 7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, so on turn 9, it can be eaten before disappearing.\n\nAfter turn 9, life span 0, gone.\n\nSo I can eat at turn 9.\n\nBut I need to ensure I can reach.\n\nAlso, during this, the snake is moving, so positions change.\n\nBut in this plan, it should be fine.\n\nNow back to turn 2.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 4, I go to (4,5), but from (3,5) to (4,5) is Right.\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5) to (4,4), which is Down.\n\nCurrent direction at turn 4 after moving to (4,5): direction is Right.\n\nThen at turn 5, moving Down: is Down opposite to Right? No, Right is horizontal, Down is vertical, not opposite. Opposite would be Left for Right.\n\nSo I can move Down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the plan, at turn 5, I move to (4,4), then turn 6 to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to think about survival, after eating (6,4), I am at (6,4), with length 4, then I need to go up to (6,6), but (6,5) might be free.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince the state will change after actions, I can output for the first few turns.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 2 to turn 6 or something.\n\nAt turn 2, action; turn 3, action; etc.\n\nIn my plan, at turn 2: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen turn 4: R to (4,5)\n\nThen for turn 5, I said D to (4,4), but is that necessary? I could go directly to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut to go to (6,4), going down to (4,4) is direct.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (5,5) then down, but longer.\n\n(4,4) is closer to (6,4).\n\nAlso, (4,4) is free.\n\nBut let's see if there is risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6) is at y=6, so when going to (6,6), I need to avoid x=3 at y=6, but since I'm going to x=6, it's fine.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I think moving Right is good.\n\nBut earlier I considered moving Up to (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nIf I move Up to (2,5) at turn 2, then turn 3 to (3,5) eat, then at turn 3, head at (3,5) direction Right.\n\nThen I can go Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5).\n\nIf I go Down to (3,4), then I am at (3,4), which is similar to if I had gone via (3,4) first, but now I have an extra move.\n\nIn terms of position, at turn 3 after eating, if I went via (2,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)], whereas if via (3,4), [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nSo in both cases, tail at (2,4), but body at (2,5) or (3,4).\n\nThen when I move, if I go to (3,4) from here, it might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the first case, if body is at (3,4), moving to (3,4) is collision.\n\nBut in this path, if I go to (3,4) at turn 4, from (3,5), moving Down to (3,4), if (3,4) is not body, it should be fine.\n\nIn the via (2,5) path, at turn 3, positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)], so (3,4) is free, so I can move Down to (3,4).\n\nThen new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)? After move: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, moving Right to (3,4) or Up to (2,5) are both fine.\n\nI think I'll go with Right to (3,4) to be closer to the right side.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nSince turn 2 is current, I need action for turn 2, then turn 3, etc.\n\nBut how many? The boxed should contain the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output for 5 turns: turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, in my plan, I would be at (5,4) or something.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 2: R (right) to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: U (up) to (3,5) eat\n\nThen for turn 4, I need to choose, say R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: D (down) to (4,4) to go to y=4\n\nTurn 6: R (right) to (5,4)\n\nThen later to (6,4) at turn 7.\n\nBut for the answer, I can stop at turn 6 or so.\n\nSince the food might be eaten, the state changes, so perhaps output until I eat or something.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify, so I'll output for 5 actions: turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nBut turn 6 is t1+4, since t1=2, t1+1=3, t1+2=4, t1+3=5, t1+4=6.\n\nSo turns: 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nActions: 2:R, 3:U, 4:R, 5:D, 6:R\n\nBut at turn 5, moving to (4,4), is that necessary? From (4,5), I could go directly right to (5,5), but (5,5) is farther from (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so going down to (4,4) is better to align.\n\nI could go to (5,4) directly from (4,5)? From (4,5) to (5,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5). Not (5,4).\n\nTo go to (5,4), I need to move down or right first.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can move Down to (4,4), then Right to (5,4).\n\nOr Right to (5,5), then Down to (5,4), but that takes two moves to (5,4), same as down then right.\n\nBut (5,4) is not food, so no need to go directly.\n\nIn the path to (6,4), from (4,5), going to (4,4) then (5,4) etc. is fine.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (5,5) if I want to go to (6,6), but I plan to go to (6,4) first.\n\n(6,4) has longer life span, but (6,6) has shorter, so I should eat (6,6) first? But (6,6) is farther and life span same as (3,5) which I eat first.\n\nAt turn 2, (6,6) life span 8, (6,4) 9, so (6,6) might disappear earlier.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) at turn 3, at turn 4, (6,6) life span: at turn 3, it was 7 (after decrease), so 7 turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) 8 turns left.\n\nFrom position at turn 4, say (4,5), to (6,6) is |6-4| + |6-5| = 2+1=3 moves, to (6,4) is |6-4| + |4-5|=2+1=3 moves, same distance.\n\nBut (6,6) has less life span, so I should prioritize eating (6,6) before it disappears.\n\n(6,6) life span 8 at turn 2, at turn 4: after turn 2:7, turn3:6, turn4:5, so 5 turns left.\n\nAt turn 5:4, turn6:3, etc.\n\nI can eat by turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5), I can go to (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) in three moves.\n\nFor (6,4), from (4,5), to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) also three moves.\n\nBut (6,4) has more life span, so I can eat (6,6) first.\n\nThen (6,4) later.\n\nBut after eating (6,6), I am at (6,6), then I can go down to (6,4) or something.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (6,6) to (6,4) is down two steps.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nFor the sequence, at turn 4, from (3,5), I should go Right to (4,5) as before.\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,5), instead of going down, go Right to (5,5) to approach (6,6).\n\nThen turn 6, Right to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 7, Up to (6,6) to eat.\n\nAt turn 7, (6,6) life span: at turn 4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2, so can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) can be eaten later.\n\nSo this might be better to avoid losing (6,6).\n\n(6,4) has life span 9, at turn 7: after turn 2:7? Turn 2:9, turn3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, so 4 turns left, can be eaten later.\n\nSo for turn 2 to 6 actions:\n\nTurn 2: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: R to (5,5)  // to go towards (6,6)\n\nTurn 6: R to (6,5)  // then next turn to (6,6)\n\nBut at turn 6, head at (6,5), then turn 7 U to (6,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to turn 6.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 5, moving to (5,5), from (4,5) to (5,5) is Right.\n\nCurrent direction at turn 4 after moving to (4,5): direction Right.\n\nThen turn 5, move Right to (5,5), same direction, fine.\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5) to (6,5) Right again.\n\nThen later to (6,6) Up.\n\nBut in turn 6, I am at (6,5), not eating yet.\n\nBut for the output, I can stop at turn 6.\n\nSince the state changes, but for the sequence, it's ok.\n\nI think this is a plan.\n\nTo confirm, at turn 2, moving Left to (1,4) is not good, as it wastes time.\n\nSo I'll go with Right.\n\nFinal decision.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that focuses on eating the positive food efficiently while avoiding collisions and considering the life spans of the food items. The closest food is at (3,5) with a life span of 8 (disappearing after turn 9), so it should be eaten first to grow the snake and enable easier access to other food. After eating (3,5), I will head toward (6,6) next, as it has a shorter remaining life span (8 at turn 2, disappearing after turn 9) compared to (6,4) (life span 9, disappearing after turn 10). This ensures (6,6) is eaten before it expires. The path avoids the internal obstacle at (3,6) and walls, and all moves comply with the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n### Key Points in the 5+ Turn Plan:\n- **Turn 2 (current turn)**: Move right (R) to (3,4). This positions the snake to eat (3,5) on turn 3 and avoids moving away from food or into risk.\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 3.\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (4,5). This starts the path toward (6,6) and keeps options open.\n- **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (5,5). Continues toward (6,6) efficiently.\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (6,5). Sets up to eat (6,6) on turn 7.\n- **Beyond Turn 6**: On turn 7, move up (U) to (6,6) to eat, then head to (6,4) for the remaining food. This sequence eats all food within their life spans and maintains safe movement.\n\n### Detailed Reasoning:\n- **Turn 2 (Action: R)**: \n  - Current head at (2,4), direction Up. Possible moves: Up (to (2,5)), Left (to (1,4)), or Right (to (3,4)); Down is invalid (reverse move).\n  - Moving Right to (3,4) is optimal: it positions the snake one step from (3,5) for eating on turn 3 and avoids moving left (away from food) or up (which offers no immediate benefit). No collision risk.\n- **Turn 3 (Action: U)**:\n  - Head at (3,4), direction Right (from previous move). Possible moves: Up (to (3,5)), Down (to (3,3)), or Right (to (4,4)); Left invalid (reverse).\n  - Move Up to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length 3). After eating, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4). Direction now Up.\n- **Turn 4 (Action: R)**:\n  - Head at (3,5), direction Up. Possible moves: Left (to (2,5)), Right (to (4,5)), or Up (to (3,6)); Down invalid (reverse), and Up is blocked by obstacle (3,6).\n  - Move Right to (4,5) to head toward (6,6). This avoids the left move (which could lead to less efficient paths) and leverages the open right side. No food at (4,5), so length remains 3. Direction now Right.\n- **Turn 5 (Action: R)**:\n  - Head at (4,5), direction Right. Possible moves: Up (to (4,6)), Down (to (4,4)), or Right (to (5,5)); Left invalid (reverse).\n  - Move Right to (5,5) to continue to (6,6). This is direct and minimizes turns; moving down or up would delay reaching (6,6). No food, length 3. Direction remains Right.\n- **Turn 6 (Action: R)**:\n  - Head at (5,5), direction Right. Possible moves: Up (to (5,6)), Down (to (5,4)), or Right (to (6,5)); Left invalid.\n  - Move Right to (6,5) to set up eating (6,6) on turn 7. (6,6) has life span 3 at turn 6 (from turn 2:8, decreasing each turn), so eating on turn 7 is safe. No food at (6,5), length 3.\n- **Long-Term (Turns 7+)**:\n  - Turn 7: Move Up to (6,6) to eat (life span 2 at turn 7, so it can be eaten). Score +1, length 4.\n  - Then, head to (6,4) (life span 4 at turn 7) via Down moves (e.g., to (6,4) on turn 8 or 9). This prioritizes survival by avoiding dead ends and using open space.\n\nThis plan eats all food within 7 turns, scores +3, and maintains safety by:\n- Avoiding the obstacle at (3,6) and walls.\n- No tail reward danger (tail never has food during moves).\n- No risk of trapping; the grid has ample space after eating.\n- Moves are validated for no instant reverse.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 3: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right)\n}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), and one body segment at (2,4). So the snake has length 2. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to get to (3,4) from (2,4)? Let's see: from (2,4) to (3,4) is moving right, so current direction is R.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The output should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t1=3.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,4) with direction R, possible moves are U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since direction is R, I cannot move left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so opposite is L. So forbidden moves: L.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R. Moving right would be continuing in the same direction.\n\nNow, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body (2,4). So the snake occupies (3,4) and (2,4).\n\nFood: (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is directly above the head? Head at (3,4), so (3,5) is up one cell.\n\n(6,4) is right three cells from head? Head at (3,4), so (6,4) is at same y, x=6.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is right and up.\n\nLife spans: all have high life spans, 7 or 8, so they won't disappear soon. Since we start at turn 3, and life span decreases each turn including current, so for (3,5), life span 7 at turn 3, so it will disappear after 7 turns? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n\n- After turn t+1, countdown becomes L-2\n\n- ...\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nBut it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, so at turn 10? Let's define.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food is spawned with life span N.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown decreases by 1, so life span becomes N-1.\n\nAfter turn t+1, life span becomes N-2.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn t + (N-1), life span becomes 0, and after this turn, it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, inclusive? And disappears before turn t + N.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from the current turn, it is no longer there.\n\nSo for food at turn 3 with life span 7: it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it is gone at turn 10. So it exists on turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, life span 8: exists from turn 3 to turn 10, gone at turn 11? Turn 3 + 8 - 1 = turn 10, since it decreases including current turn.\n\nLet's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it is present with life span L. After turn t is processed, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (3,5): at turn 3, life span 7. After turn 3, life span becomes 6. After turn 4, 5, ..., after turn 9, life span becomes 0, and after turn 9, it disappears, so not present at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6): life span 7 at turn 3, same as above.\n\n(6,4): life span 8 at turn 3, so after turn 3, 7; ... after turn 10, 0, disappears after turn 10.\n\nBut since we're at turn 3, and planning ahead, for the next few turns, all food will be present, as life spans are high.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food and avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (3,4) with direction R:\n\n- U: to (3,5) – but (3,5) has food! So moving up would eat the food at (3,5).\n\n- D: to (3,3) – empty, I think? No food mentioned, and not wall.\n\n- R: to (4,4) – empty.\n\n- L: not allowed, reverse direction.\n\nAlso, need to check if cells are valid: not walls.\n\n(3,5): x=3,y=5, not a wall? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (3,5) is within, and internal obstacle is (3,6), not (3,5), so (3,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): should be free.\n\n(4,4): free.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,5), I eat the food. Since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake will be: new head at (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, and previous body (2,4) remains, so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nBut let's think about the tail. The tail is at (2,4). After moving, the tail moves? When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed. But if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nSpecifically: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows: the head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the head position. The body segments follow as usual.\n\nIf no food, head moves, body follows, tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,5) which has food, I eat it, so snake grows to length 3: head at (3,5), then (3,4), then (2,4).\n\nNow, is there any risk? Tail at (2,4), and head is at (3,5). Are they adjacent? (3,5) and (2,4) are not adjacent; (3,5) is up and (2,4) is left-down, not touching. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically, (3,5) and (2,5) would be horizontally, but (2,4) is different.\n\nPositions: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). So head at (3,5), body at (3,4), then tail at (2,4). The head is adjacent to (3,4), which is the body segment immediately after head, but that's fine, it's not a collision because the snake is connected. Collision is with other body segments or walls.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail if it's moving away, but generally, touching body is collision except when moving into the tail cell as the tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (3,5) is empty, so no issue.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nHere, current state: head at (3,4), tail at (2,4). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (2,4) share a side, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is at (3,5), not on the tail cell. Tail cell is (2,4), which has no food mentioned, so no food there.\n\nSo moving to (3,5) should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail position. Tail is at (2,4), no food there.\n\nSo option: move U to eat (3,5) immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. After eating, snake is longer, at (3,5), (3,4), (2,4).\n\nThen direction: if I moved U, new head direction is U.\n\nPossible next moves.\n\nBut also, there are other food: (6,4) and (6,6). (6,4) is on the same row, x=6,y=4, so from (3,4), it's three steps right.\n\n(6,6) is three right and two up.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) now, I might be away from (6,4) and (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is directly right, at (6,4), and head is at (3,4), so if I move R now to (4,4), I can go towards (6,4).\n\nOr if I move U, I go to (3,5), then I can move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nI should consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is a wall, so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, from (3,4), moving U to (3,5) is fine, but then from (3,5), I cannot move U to (3,6) because it's a wall.\n\nSo if I go to (3,5), I can only move L, R, or D.\n\nDirections: from (3,5), head direction U, so possible moves: U, D, L, R, but U to (3,6) is wall, so cannot. Reverse direction? Reverse of U is D, which is down, to (3,4), which is the body.\n\nIf I move D from (3,5) to (3,4), that would be moving back to the body segment at (3,4), which is not the tail; tail is at (2,4). So moving to (3,4) would cause collision because (3,4) is occupied by body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4).\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), that cell has the body segment, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nOr D to (3,4) but that's occupied, so invalid.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), or U not possible, D not possible because occupied.\n\nD to (3,4) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\nTherefore, only L or R from (3,5).\n\nNow, similarly, if I don't eat now, I can move R or D from current position.\n\nCurrent position (3,4), direction R, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nMove R to (4,4): no food, so snake moves: head to (4,4), body to (3,4), tail (2,4) is removed? No.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body segments follow, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after move R to (4,4): positions: head (4,4), body (3,4). Tail was (2,4), but since no growth, tail moves to where the body was, but the body segments shift.\n\nSnake positions: originally [(3,4), (2,4)].\n\nAfter moving R to (4,4): head moves to (4,4), then the body segment that was at (2,4) moves to the previous head position (3,4), so new positions: [(4,4), (3,4)].\n\nLength remains 2.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,3): head to (3,3), body to (3,4)? Positions: [(3,4), (2,4)] move D to (3,3), so head (3,3), and body (3,4), but (2,4) is left, so the segment at (2,4) moves to (3,4), so [(3,3), (3,4)].\n\n(3,4) was head, now body, and (2,4) moves to (3,4), but (3,4) is now occupied by the first body segment.\n\nLet's think: the snake is a list: index 0 head, index 1 body, etc.\n\nAfter move, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from [(3,4), (2,4)], move R to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then the body segment moves to where head was, (3,4). So new positions: [(4,4), (3,4)].\n\nSimilarly, move D to (3,3): new head (3,3), body moves to (3,4), so [(3,3), (3,4)].\n\nMove U to (3,5): with food, so head moves to (3,5), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, and previous body (2,4) remains, so [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I move U now, I eat food, grow to length 3, but then I'm at (3,5) and can only move L or R, since U is wall, D is body.\n\nThen, if I move L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) might be empty, or (4,5).\n\nBut I need to get to other food, like (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is on y=4.\n\nIf I go to (3,5), I'm at y=5, so I need to go down later to reach y=4.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) at y=6.\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, so from (3,5), I cannot go up.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (3,6) blocks the column at x=3, y=6.\n\nNow, another option: move R from current to (4,4), no food, then I can continue towards (6,4).\n\nOr move D to (3,3), down.\n\n(3,3) might be safer or something.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eat as much food as possible, but avoid dying.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, it's harder to move.\n\nBut currently length 2, small.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) now, I get +1, but then I'm at (3,5) with limited moves.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I move R to (4,5), then I can go to (4,4) or (4,6), etc.\n\n(4,6) is y=6, x=4.\n\nFood at (6,6) and (6,4).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (5,5), (5,4), etc., towards (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is closer in terms of x.\n\nPaths to (6,4): from current (3,4), moving R three times: to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), and eat at (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6): from (3,4), I need to go up and right.\n\nBut with the wall at (3,6), I cannot go directly up from x=3.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), then R to (4,5), then U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), (6,6), but (4,6) might be valid? x=4,y=6, not wall, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine, x=4 fine. Wall at (3,6), not (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free.\n\nThen to (6,6): (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4): from (3,4) move R to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has life span 8, (6,6) has 7, (3,5) has 7, all similar.\n\nBut (3,5) is very close.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,5) now, and move R, I can go to (6,4) in three moves, eat it, but during that, (3,5) might be there, but I can eat it later? (3,5) is at turn 3 life span 7, so it will be there until after turn 9, so many turns.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut after moving away, if I want to eat (3,5), I need to come back.\n\nBut the snake body might block.\n\nSince the snake is short, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nIn this case, not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no.\n\nI should plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 3, I can choose:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,5), eat food, score +1, snake now [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)], head direction U.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (3,5), I can move L or R (since U wall, D body).\n\nSay move R to (4,5), no food, so positions: head to (4,5), body moves: (3,5) to (3,4)? Positions: head was (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), no food, so tail moves: body segment at (3,4) moves to where head was? Standard movement: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n\nSo from [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)], move head to (4,5).\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nThen body segment 1: moves to previous head position (3,5)\n\nBody segment 2: moves to previous body position (3,4)\n\nBut there are three segments: index 0 head (3,5), index 1 (3,4), index 2 (2,4)\n\nAfter move, new head at (4,5)\n\nThen index 1 moves to where index 0 was, (3,5)\n\nIndex 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,5), head direction R (since moved right from (3,5) to (4,5)).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse? Current direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, occupied.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body, so cannot move L.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\n(4,6) should be free, no wall or food mentioned.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nSo can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, I can go towards (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (4,5), moving D to (4,4) gets closer to y=4.\n\nOr U to (4,6) towards y=6.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), so from (4,5) move R to (5,5), then (6,5), then to (6,6) but (6,6) is food, so when move to (6,6), eat it.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,6)? (6,5) to (6,6) is U, but (6,6) is the target.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4): from (4,5) move D to (4,4), then R to (5,4), (6,4).\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 3 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,5) now, and move R to (4,4).\n\nAt turn 3, move R to (4,4), no food, positions: [(4,4), (3,4)] length 2, head direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (4,4), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L reverse).\n\nMove to (5,4) for example, towards (6,4).\n\n(5,4) empty, so positions: head (5,4), body (4,4).\n\nThen turn 5, to (6,4), eat food, score +1, snake grows to [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)].\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nSimilarly, I could have eaten (3,5) later, but after moving to (4,4), (3,5) is still there, but to eat it, I need to move back left and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I could move U to (4,5), then L to (3,5), but at turn 4, from (4,4) move U to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,5), direction U, can move U, D, L, R, but U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) occupied by body, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (3,5) has food, so move to (3,5), eat food, score +1, snake grows: head to (3,5), body to (4,5), and tail (4,4) remains, so [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)].\n\nBut in this case, I ate (3,5) at turn 5 instead of turn 3.\n\nIf I eat at turn 3, I get the point earlier, but I might be in a better position.\n\nBut the score is the same, +1 whenever I eat.\n\nBut for long-term survival, position might matter.\n\nAlso, when I eat at turn 5, the snake is at (3,5), which is the same as if I ate at turn 3, but at turn 5, the body is different.\n\nIf I eat at turn 3: after turn 3, snake at (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nThen after turn 4 move R to (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) as before.\n\nIf I eat at turn 5: after turn 5, snake at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n\nSimilar positions, but different body.\n\nIn both cases, I have the food point.\n\nBut by eating later, I have a shorter snake for longer, which might be more maneuverable, but here only one extra move.\n\nBut for maximizing score, since all food is positive, I should eat as soon as possible to have more opportunities, but the food doesn't disappear soon, so I can eat later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (3,6) blocks the top at x=3.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) now, I'm at y=5, and I can move right to explore.\n\nIf I don't eat, and go to (6,4), I eat that food, then I can go to (6,6) or back.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger for (6,4).\n\nNot now.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (3,5) since it's close and easy.\n\nBut let's consider if there is a risk.\n\nCurrent head and tail are adjacent: (3,4) and (2,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is not on tail, so no danger.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), head at (3,5), tail at (2,4), not adjacent, since (3,5) and (2,4) are diagonal, not sharing side, so not adjacent.\n\nThen no issue.\n\nSimilarly, after eating, tail at (2,4), head at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen when I move, it should be fine.\n\nBut later, when the snake is longer, I need to be careful.\n\nFor now, I think eating (3,5) is safe and gets a point.\n\nThen I can head towards the other food.\n\nThe other food (6,4) and (6,6) are both at x=6.\n\n(6,4) is on the same row, (6,6) is up.\n\nAlso, the grid has borders, so I need to avoid walls.\n\nSince I need to plan 5 turns ahead, let's outline a sequence.\n\nStart at turn 3: position (3,4), direction R.\n\nOption: Move U to eat (3,5).\n\nThen turn 3: U\n\nAfter: snake [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)], score +1, direction U.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), can move L or R. Say move R to (4,5), no food. New positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), body (3,4) — positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\n(4,6) up, (4,4) down, (5,5) right.\n\nI can move R to (5,5) towards (6,6).\n\nOr D to (4,4) towards (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,5) I can go to (5,6) or (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) from (4,4) move R to (5,4), (6,4).\n\nSince both are at x=6, I can choose which one to go for first.\n\nBut (6,4) has longer life span? (6,4) life span 8, (6,6) life span 7, both high.\n\n(6,4) life 8, (6,6) life 7 at turn 3.\n\nBut since we start at turn 3, (6,6) disappears after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10, so (6,4) lasts one turn longer.\n\nBut for short term, similar.\n\nPerhaps go for (6,4) since it's on the way or something.\n\nBut from current, after turn 4 at (4,5), moving D to (4,4) gets to y=4.\n\nThen to (5,4), (6,4).\n\nOr move R to (5,5), then to (5,6) or (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is R, or from (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,6) U.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), so from (6,5) move U to (6,6).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to save moves, perhaps from (4,5) move R to (5,5), then at turn 6 move to (6,5), turn 7 move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut at turn 7 I eat (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,4) if possible.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (6,6) I can move D to (6,5), then to (6,4), but (6,5) may not have food, so move D to (6,5), no food, then D to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut when I move to (6,4), if the tail is not adjacent, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nAnother option at turn 3: instead of eating (3,5), move R to (4,4).\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4), (3,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 4: from (4,4), direction R, move to (5,4), no food, positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 5: move to (6,4), eat food, score +1, snake grows to [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)], direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move U, D, L (not R if border, x=6, x=7 is wall, so cannot move R, since x=7 is wall.\n\nx=7 is wall, so from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) is body, occupied, so cannot move L.\n\nU to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nSay move U to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4) — from [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] move U to (6,5), no food, so tail moves: head (6,5), body moves to (6,4), and the last body moves to (5,4)? Positions: index 0 (6,4), index 1 (5,4), index 2 (4,4)\n\nAfter move head to (6,5), no food, so new: head (6,5), index 1 to (6,4), index 2 to (5,4)\n\nSo [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nThen I can go to (6,6) from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut at turn 6, from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,5) later, but it might be blocked by the body.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, after eating (6,4), snake at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), then I move to (6,5), then to (6,6), but (3,5) is still there, but to eat it, I need to go back to (3,5), which might be far and the body might be in the way.\n\nFor instance, from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6), (4,6), etc., but to reach (3,5), I need to go to (3,5) from, say, (3,4) or (4,5), but (3,4) might be occupied later.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) first, I can then go to (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nFrom after eating (3,5) at turn 3, then turn 4 move R to (4,5), turn 5 move R to (5,5), turn 6 move to (5,6) or (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nOr from (5,5) move D to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), so from (5,4) move R to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to compare: if I eat (3,5) at turn 3, I get point at turn 3.\n\nThen I can get to (6,4) or (6,6) around turn 6 or 7.\n\nIf I go to (6,4) first without eating (3,5), I eat at turn 5, then to (6,6) at turn 6 or 7, and (3,5) is uneaten, so I can go back, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (6,6) at turn 7, move L to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, cannot.\n\nFrom (6,6) move L to (5,6), then D to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) but at (3,5) I can eat if I move to it.\n\nBut at that time, the snake body might be long, and (3,5) might be blocked.\n\nFor instance, if snake is at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), etc., then moving to (3,5) requires navigating through the grid.\n\nWhereas if I eat (3,5) early, it's done.\n\nAlso, since the snake is shorter, it's easier to move.\n\nMoreover, (3,5) has life span 7, so it will be there until after turn 9, so I have time, but eating early might be better to free up space or something.\n\nBut in terms of score, eating sooner or later doesn't matter, as long as I eat before it disappears.\n\nBut for long-term, I might find more food, but in this grid, only three food are given, so I should eat all three.\n\nSo I need to eat (3,5), (6,4), (6,6).\n\nThe efficient way is to eat (3,5) now, then go to (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance from (3,4): |6-3| + |4-4| = 3, while (6,6) is |3| + |2| = 5, and (3,5) is |0| + |1| =1.\n\nSo (3,5) is closest.\n\nThen (6,4) is next, then (6,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), to (6,4) is |3| + |1| =4, to (6,6) is |3| + |1| =4, same.\n\nBut from (3,5), I can go directly to (6,4) via moving right and down, but down might not be direct.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) move R to (4,5), then D to (4,4), then R to (5,4), (6,4).\n\n4 moves: turn 4 to (4,5), turn 5 to (4,4), turn 6 to (5,4), turn 7 to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut at turn 5 to (4,4), from (4,5) move D, which is down.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6): from (3,5) move R to (4,5), turn 4; then to (4,6) U, turn 5; then to (5,6) R, turn 6; to (6,6) R, turn 7 eat.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nIf I go to (6,4) first from start: turn 3 move R to (4,4), turn 4 to (5,4), turn 5 to (6,4) eat, at turn 5.\n\nThen from (6,4) to (6,6): move U to (6,5) turn 6, U to (6,6) turn 7 eat.\n\nAnd (3,5) is still there, so from (6,6) I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (6,6) at turn 7, move L to (5,6), turn 7; then to (5,5), turn 8; to (4,5), turn 9; to (3,5) L, but from (4,5) move L to (3,5) at turn 10? Let's count.\n\nAfter eating (6,6) at turn 7, positions say [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4)] or something, but let's assume after turn 7: head at (6,6), body (6,5), tail (5,5) or whatever.\n\nFrom (6,6), move L to (5,6), no food, positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), etc.\n\nThen from (5,6) move D to (5,5), turn 8.\n\nThen from (5,5) move L to (4,5), turn 9.\n\nThen from (4,5) move L to (3,5), eat at turn 10.\n\nBut (3,5) life span 7 at turn 3, so after turn 9 it disappears, so at turn 10 it is gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 3, life span 7, so after turn 3, life span 6; ... after turn 9, life span 0, disappears after turn 9, so not present at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 is too late to eat (3,5).\n\nAt turn 9, it is present with life span? At turn 3: 7, turn 4:6, turn 5:5, turn 6:4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, after turn 9, life span 0, disappears, so not there at turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 9, if I move to (3,5), I can eat it, since life span 1, present.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 9, I can be at (4,5) moving to (3,5).\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5) move L to (3,5), eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSo I can eat all three: (6,4) at turn 5, (6,6) at turn 7, (3,5) at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, I eat (3,5), just before it disappears.\n\nWhereas if I eat (3,5) early at turn 3, I can eat (6,4) at turn 7 or so, and (6,6) similarly.\n\nIn the first sequence with early eat: turn 3 eat (3,5), then say turn 4 to (4,5), turn 5 to (5,5), turn 6 to (6,5), turn 7 to (6,6) eat, then from (6,6) to (6,4) but (6,4) is below, move D to (6,5), then D to (6,4), but (6,5) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 7 at (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5) or something.\n\nMove D to (6,5)? (6,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nFrom (6,6) move D to (6,5) is invalid if occupied.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (6,6), the previous position was (6,5), which is now body.\n\nSo from (6,6), I can only move U, D, L, R but U may be wall if y=7, y=7 is border wall, so y=6, U to y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,5) is occupied by body, cannot.\n\nL to (5,6), possible.\n\nR to (7,6) but x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,4) etc. to reach (6,4), but it's complicated.\n\nFrom (6,6) I cannot directly go down because (6,5) is occupied.\n\nI need to move away first.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,6), then D to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so when move to (6,4), eat.\n\nBut at that point, if the body is not on (6,4), it should be fine.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nIn the late eat sequence, I go to (6,4) first, then to (6,6), then back to (3,5).\n\nIn early eat, I eat (3,5) first, then (6,6), but (6,4) is harder to reach from (6,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) early, I can go to (6,4) instead of (6,6).\n\nFor example, turn 3 U to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 4 R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5 D to (4,4)  // down to y=4\n\nTurn 6 R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7 R to (6,4) eat\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go to (6,6) but similar issue, cannot move up directly if body below.\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 7, positions after eating: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]? After move to (6,4) with food, so head (6,4), body (5,4), body (4,4) since grown.\n\nThen direction R.\n\nCan move U to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4)\n\nThen move U to (6,6) at turn 8, eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSo in this case, with early eat: eat (3,5) turn 3, (6,4) turn 7, (6,6) turn 8.\n\nOr with late eat: eat (6,4) turn 5, (6,6) turn 7, (3,5) turn 9.\n\nBoth possible, but in late eat, I eat (3,5) at turn 9 just before it disappears, which is riskier if something blocks.\n\nIn early eat, I eat it safely at turn 3.\n\nAlso, in early eat, I have a point earlier, but score is the same.\n\nBut for long-term survival, having a shorter snake might be better for avoiding collisions.\n\nIn early eat, from turn 3 to turn 7, snake length 3, while in late eat, at turn 5, I grow to 3, etc.\n\nBut not significant difference.\n\nAnother point: the food at (6,4) has life span 8, so it lasts longer, I can eat it later.\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 7, same as (6,6).\n\nI think eating (3,5) now is fine.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it, and move away, the cell (3,5) might be occupied later by body or something, making it harder to eat.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,4) first, the snake might pass through cells that block the path to (3,5).\n\nBut with careful movement, it can be done.\n\nBut to minimize risk, eating close food first might be better.\n\nAlso, the instruction says \"prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards\", but here eating (3,5) is low risk.\n\nThere is a potential risk with the wall.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can only move L or R, not U or D immediately.\n\nIf I move to a dead end, it might be dangerous.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (2,5), then I might be cornered.\n\nBut I can move R to (4,5), which is open.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, at turn 3, I will move U to eat (3,5).\n\nThen for the next turns, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3, so I need actions for turn 3,4,5,6,7,8? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\" so I need to list a sequence.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions, for turns 3 to 7 or 8.\n\nLet's plan a sequence to eat the foods.\n\nStart at turn 3: move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,5) to go towards other food.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (6,4) or (6,6). Let's choose (6,4) since it's on the bottom row.\n\nSo turn 5: move D to (4,4)  // down to y=4\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,4) to eat food.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (6,6).\n\nAt turn 8, from (6,4), move U to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 7, after eating (6,4), snake at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) or something.\n\nAfter move to (6,4) with food, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), body (4,4) since grew.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen move U to (6,5), no food, so positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4)\n\nThen move U to (6,6), eat, so at turn 8.\n\nTurn 7: at (6,4) move U to (6,5)? Turn 7 action is to move to (6,4) and eat, so after turn 7, positions as above.\n\nThen turn 8: move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut (6,6) life span 7 at turn 3, at turn 9 life span? Turn 3:7, turn4:6, ..., turn9:1, present, so eat at turn 9 ok.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) eaten at turn 3.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns 3 to 9.\n\nBut I need to output from turn 3 with actions.\n\nAlso, at turn 4, when moving from (3,5) to (4,5), it's fine.\n\nNow, for the internal wall at (3,6), it doesn't affect us since we're not going there.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\nTurn 3: U (to eat (3,5))\n\nThen turn 4: R (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 5: D (to (4,4))\n\nThen turn 6: R (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (6,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 8: U (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 9: U (to (6,6) eat)\n\nBut the output should be for turns starting from t1=3, and I need at least 5 actions? From turn 3 to 7 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 3,4,5,6,7: 5 turns.\n\nI can provide more if I want.\n\nSince the grid is small, and no other food, this should be fine.\n\nAt turn 5, moving D to (4,4), is (4,4) free? Yes, no wall or food.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nI could go to (6,6) first from (4,5).\n\nFor example, turn 4 R to (4,5), turn 5 U to (4,6), turn 6 R to (5,6), turn 7 R to (6,6) eat.\n\nThen from (6,6) to (6,4) as before.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think the sequence to (6,4) is fine.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide actions for turn 3 to turn 7.\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nAfter turn 7, I am at (6,4) with food eaten.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, since it says \"...\" I can stop at turn 7.\n\nTo be complete, I can add more.\n\nBut I think 5 actions are sufficient.\n\nNow, about the direction: at each turn, I need to specify the action, and the head direction will change.\n\nBut in the output, I just need the action.\n\nAlso, for turn 4, when moving from (3,5) to (4,5), direction was U, moving R, which is not reverse, allowed.\n\nSimilarly, turn 5 from (4,5) direction R, moving D, which is perpendicular, allowed, not reverse.\n\nReverse would be opposite, like from R to L, but D is down, not left, so ok.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating all available positive food items efficiently and safely. The current state at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) has the snake at positions [(3,4), (2,4)] with head direction right (R). Available food includes:\n- (3,5) with value +1 and life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n- (6,6) with value +1 and life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n- (6,4) with value +1 and life span 8 (disappears after turn 10).\n\nThe grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,6). The snake is short (length 2), allowing flexibility, but growth must be managed to avoid collisions. The plan is to:\n- Immediately eat the closest food at (3,5) on turn 3 for an early score and to free up the area.\n- Then navigate toward (6,4) via a path that avoids the internal wall and borders, eating it on turn 7.\n- Finally, proceed to (6,6) for consumption by turn 9, within its life span.\n\nThe sequence below covers 5+ turns (turns 3 to 8) to demonstrate the multi-step plan. Actions are chosen to:\n- Avoid instant reverses (e.g., from R, cannot move L).\n- Prevent collisions with walls, body, or tail.\n- Ensure the snake does not get trapped, especially after growth.\n\n### Planned Actions:\n- **Turn 3 (current)**: Move U to (3,5) to eat the positive food. This gains +1 score, increases length to 3, and positions the snake at [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] with new head direction U. Risk is low: head at (3,5) is not adjacent to tail at (2,4), and no body collision.\n- **Turn 4**: Move R to (4,5). No food, so snake moves to [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] with head direction R. This avoids moving down (which would collide with body at (3,4)) and starts pathing toward other food.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (4,4). No food, so snake moves to [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] with head direction D. This descends to y=4 to align with (6,4) and avoids moving left (to (3,4), which is occupied) or up (to (4,6), which is less efficient for reaching (6,4)).\n- **Turn 6**: Move R to (5,4). No food, so snake moves to [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] with head direction R. Continues toward (6,4) efficiently.\n- **Turn 7**: Move R to (6,4) to eat positive food. Gains +1 score, increases length to 4, positions snake at [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] with head direction R. Safe as (6,4) is unoccupied and not adjacent to tail at (4,5).\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (6,5). No food, so snake moves to [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] with head direction U. Prepares to reach (6,6) by moving up, avoiding down (to (6,3), which is less efficient) or left/right (blocked or inefficient).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations:\n- By turn 8, the snake has eaten two foods (score +2) and is positioned to eat (6,6) on turn 9 (move U from (6,5) to (6,6)).\n- The path avoids the internal wall at (3,6) and borders, with no dead ends.\n- After turn 8, the snake should prioritize (6,6) and then explore for more food or safe areas to extend survival.\n- All food is consumed before expiration: (3,5) by turn 3, (6,6) by turn 9, and (6,4) by turn 7 (well before turn 10).\n\nThis plan maximizes score with minimal risk, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and the grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). The snake is at positions: head at (3,5), then body at (3,4), and tail at (2,4). The head is facing Up, so moving U increases y.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (6,6) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- At (6,4) with life span 7 and value +1\n\n- At (3,2) with life span 10 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake length is 3 segments: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4).\n\nPossible moves: Since head is facing Up, I can go U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nSo from (3,5), moving:\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\n- L: to (2,5)\n\n- R: to (4,5)\n\nBut (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so I can't go there. Walls include internal obstacles, so (3,6) is blocked. Also, borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go outside the grid.\n\nGrid size: since borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, that means the playable area is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nBorders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive. Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is y=6, x=3.\n\ny=6 is the top row since y=7 is wall, y=0 bottom.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but y=7 is wall, so max y is 6? Let's see:\n\nIf y=0 and y=7 are walls, and coordinates given, e.g., snake at (3,5), which should be within bounds.\n\nAssuming grid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except where obstacles are.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, from head (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): but (3,6) is obstacle, so not possible.\n\n- D to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by the body. However, since the snake moves, when the head moves, the body follows, so if I move down to (3,4), which is currently the body, but after move, the tail will move away, so it might be okay? No, collision rules.\n\nDeadly collisions: head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, (3,4) is the body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,4).\n\nSnake positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] so head at (3,5), segment 1 at (3,4), segment 2 at (2,4) which is tail.\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), that is currently occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail, so head would be moving into a body segment, causing collision. That's deadly.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,5), that might be free? Current positions: (3,5) head, (3,4) body, (2,4) tail. So (2,5) is empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nOccupied: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2)\n\nWalls at borders and (3,6)\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6) - wall, not possible\n\n- D: (3,4) - occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, deadly\n\n- L: (2,5) - not occupied, not wall? (2,5): x=2, y=5. x=2 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, not obstacle, not occupied, so possible.\n\n- R: (4,5) - x=4, y=5, should be free.\n\nNow, (4,5) is within bounds? x=4, y=5, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is x=2, y=5, fine.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,5) or R to (4,5). Cannot go U or D.\n\nD is to (3,4) which is body, collision. U to wall.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food life span: each turn, life span decreases, including current turn? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nFor food at (6,6), life span 6 at turn 4. So it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning it will be gone at turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 4, life span 6, after turn 4, it decreases to 5, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it lasts for N turns including the current one or starting from now.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t when it's present, life span L, after turn t, L decreases by 1.\n\nSo for food at (6,6), at turn 4, life span 6. After turn 4, life span 5; after turn 5, life span 4; ... after turn 9, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the snake moves on turn t, if the food is not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for eating, it happens when the head moves onto the food cell during the move.\n\nIn terms of planning, we can think of the life span as remaining turns it will exist.\n\nFor (6,6) at turn 4, life span 6: it will exist until the end of turn 9 (after 6 decreases), so can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 4, before move, life span 6. After move, if not eaten, life span becomes 5.\n\nAt turn 5, before move, life span 5, after move if not eaten, life span 4, and so on.\n\nAfter turn when life span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, because at turn t+L-1, before move life span 1, after move if eaten, ok, if not, life span 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\nFood (6,6) at turn 4, life span 6: can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 (since 4+6-1=9)\n\nTurn 4 to turn 9 inclusive is 6 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 7 at turn 4: can be eaten turn 4 to 10 (4+7-1=10)\n\n(3,2) life span 10: turn 4 to 13 (4+10-1=13)\n\nBut I need to think only 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 9 or so.\n\nNow, back to moves: at turn 4, from (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nI need to evaluate which is better for long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider going left to (2,5).\n\nAfter move: head to (2,5), then body moves: the segment that was at (3,5) becomes body, so new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4) tail.\n\nIf head moves to (2,5), then:\n\n- New head: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 1 moves to where head was, (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2 (tail) moves to where segment 1 was, (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail was at (2,4), moves to (3,4), so (2,4) is now empty.\n\nNo food eaten, since (2,5) has no food.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2), not (2,5).\n\nNow, head direction: after moving left, direction is L.\n\nNow, from here, possible moves: from (2,5), direction L, so cannot go R (instant reverse).\n\nCan go U (up, y+1 to (2,6)), D (down, y-1 to (2,4)), or L (left, x-1 to (1,5)).\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- U to (2,6): y=6, but borders: y=7 is wall, y=6 is within, but is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (3,6), but (2,6) is different, so should be free? y=6 is not wall, x=2, y=6.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,6) is x=2,y=6, not border, not internal obstacle, so ok.\n\n- D to (2,4): (2,4) was tail, but now it's empty? After move, positions are (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). So (2,4) is empty. Moving to (2,4) should be fine.\n\n- L to (1,5): x=1, y=5, should be free, not wall, x=0 is wall, so x=1 ok.\n\nx=1 is within playable area since x=0 wall, x=1 to 6 playable.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to 6.\n\nNow, if go right to (4,5) at turn 4.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (4,5), can go U (4,6), D (4,4), R (5,5), not L (reverse).\n\n(4,6) should be free, (4,4) free, (5,5) free.\n\nNow, food considerations.\n\nThere is food at (3,2), which is close, but below.\n\nAlso, (6,4) and (6,6) are on the right.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, which is below the current head.\n\nBut current head at (3,5), so to reach (3,2), need to go down, but from (3,5), I couldn't go down because (3,4) was body.\n\nAfter moving left or right, I might be able to go down later.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) and (6,6).\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,4), but after moves, it changes.\n\nAt turn 4, before move, tail is at (2,4), and no food on it, so no issue.\n\nNow, let's plan multiple steps.\n\nFirst, I should consider going towards the food at (3,2) since it's closer and has long life span.\n\n(3,2) is at y=2, head at y=5, so 3 steps down.\n\nBut need to avoid obstacles.\n\nSince I have to choose for turn 4, and think ahead.\n\nLet me simulate both options.\n\nOption 1: Turn 4, move L to (2,5)\n\nNew state: positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)], head dir L.\n\nNow turn 5: from (2,5), possible moves U, D, L.\n\nIf I go D to (2,4): that was empty, so move to (2,4). New positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), tail (3,5)? Let's see: after head to (2,4), segment that was at (2,5) becomes body at (2,5)? Positions: before move: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter head to (2,4):\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- Body segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,5)\n\n- Tail moves to previous body position (3,5)\n\nSo new: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nNow, (2,4) has food? Food at (3,2), (6,4), (6,6), not (2,4), so no eat.\n\nHead now at (2,4), dir D (since moved down).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: from (2,4), dir D, so can go L, R, D, not U (reverse).\n\n- L to (1,4)\n\n- R to (3,4)\n\n- D to (2,3)\n\n(3,4) is currently occupied? Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), so (3,4) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) and (2,3) should be free.\n\n(2,3) is y=3, within 1-6.\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), that's fine.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), etc towards (3,2).\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 5 from (2,5) after option 1.\n\nInstead of D, I could go U or L.\n\nBut I want to reach (3,2), so going down might be better.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,5), if I go L to (1,5), then I go left, away from foods.\n\nOr U to (2,6), which is top row.\n\nBut foods are at bottom and right, so going left or up might not be efficient.\n\n(3,2) is bottom-leftish, (6,4) and (6,6) right.\n\n(3,2) is x=3,y=2, so center-bottom.\n\nCurrent after L move, head at (2,5), so to (3,2) need to go right and down.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone right at turn 4.\n\nOption 2: turn 4, move R to (4,5)\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)], head dir R.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), can go U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) has food? Food at (6,4), not (4,4). (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\n(4,4) is empty.\n\nNow, to reach (3,2), from (4,5), I could go D to (4,4), then left or down.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), so need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (4,5), going D to (4,4) or L not possible, dir R, so cannot go L.\n\nOnly U, D, R.\n\nSo to go towards (3,2), I need to go down or something.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, life span 7, so can be eaten until turn 10.\n\n(6,6) life span 6, until turn 9.\n\n(3,2) life span 10, until turn 13.\n\nSince (3,2) is closer, only 3 steps away in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,2) is |dy|=3, but directly down is blocked by body at (3,4).\n\nSo need to detour.\n\nIf I go left to (2,5) at turn 4, then from (2,5), I can go D to (2,4) at turn 5, as above.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go R to (3,4) at turn 6.\n\n(3,4) is currently empty, as in earlier state.\n\nAfter turn 5: if at (2,4) with positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen move R to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (2,4), tail (2,5)? Positions: before move head (2,4), body (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nAfter head to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Body 1 moves to (2,4)\n\n- Tail moves to (2,5)\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n\nNow, head at (3,4), dir R (since moved right from (2,4)).\n\nFrom here, I can go D to (3,3), since down is possible.\n\nThen to (3,2) at next turn.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,4) go D to (3,3)\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nNo food at (3,3), food at (3,2) is below.\n\nThen turn 7: go D to (3,2)\n\nNow, eat food at (3,2), value +1, snake grows.\n\nWhen eat food, snake grows: head moves to food, new head position, and tail does not move, so length increases.\n\nAfter eating: head to (3,2), which was food, so now positions: new head (3,2), and the body segments: since ate food, tail stays, so the previous body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the end? Standard snake growth.\n\n\"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n\nSo before eating, positions: at turn 7 before move, positions were [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] after turn 6 move.\n\nAfter turn 6: we moved to (3,3) from (3,4), so positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,2)\n\n(3,2) has food, so eat: head moves to (3,2), new head (3,2), and since eat, the tail does not move, so body segments: (3,3) becomes body, (3,4) becomes body, and (2,4) remains tail? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, if no food, all segments move, tail leaves previous position.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food, the segment that was tail stays, so new tail is added, but the positions: the body segments move as usual except the tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard: after move, if food eaten, the snake grows, so the new position has head at food, and the tail remains in place, so the segment before tail becomes new tail or something.\n\nLet's think: positions list: before move, snake has segments S0 (head), S1, S2 (tail).\n\nAfter move: if no eat, new head at new position, S0 to new head, S1 to old S0 position, S2 to old S1 position, so tail moves.\n\nIf eat, new head at food, S0 to new head, S1 to old S0 position, but S2 does not move? So the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the end, but since S2 didn't move, it's like the tail position is fixed.\n\nTypically: the head moves to the new cell, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, and the body segments shift.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,2), then the old head position (3,3) is now body, old body position (3,4) is now body, and old tail (2,4) is still tail, but since we add a segment, the new tail is the old tail, and we add a new segment? No.\n\nAfter eating, the snake length increases by one, so there is an additional segment.\n\nBefore move, 3 segments: S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(2,4)\n\nAfter move and eat: head moves to (3,2), so new S0 = (3,2)\n\nThen S1 is the old S0, which is (3,3)\n\nS2 is the old S1, which is (3,4)\n\nAnd since eat, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so S3 = (2,4)\n\nSo new positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nLength 4 now.\n\nThen head direction D.\n\nIn this path, I ate the food at (3,2) on turn 7.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (2,5)\n\nState: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] dir L\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,4)\n\nNew: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)] dir D\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,4)  // (3,4) was empty? Yes, positions have (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), so (3,4) free.\n\nMove to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (2,4), tail (2,5)  // positions: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5)] dir R (since moved right)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)  // (3,3) free\n\nNew: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] dir D? Moved down from (3,4) to (3,3), so dir D.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (3,2)\n\nEat food, grow: new positions head (3,2), body (3,3), body (3,4), tail (2,4)  // since ate, added segment at old tail, so (2,4) is now part of body, new tail is (2,4)? Let's correct.\n\nBefore move turn 8: positions [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nHead at (3,3), move D to (3,2)\n\nEat food, so new head (3,2)\n\nThen, the segment that was head (3,3) becomes body at (3,3)\n\nThe segment that was body (3,4) becomes body at (3,4)\n\nThe segment that was tail (2,4) does not move, and since we eat, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, so new position: head (3,2), then body (3,3), then body (3,4), then tail (2,4) — (2,4) is the old tail, and it stays, so it becomes the second last segment, and we add a new tail? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the new tail is the old tail, and the segment before it is extended.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving head to new cell with food, the body segments move to their previous positions except the tail stays, so the snake gains a segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,2)\n\nThen the first body segment at old head position (3,3)\n\nSecond body segment at old first body position (3,4)\n\nAnd the tail remains at (2,4), but since we add a segment, it's now the third body, and the tail is still (2,4), but we need to add a new position.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think the tail position doesn't change, so the segment that was tail stays.\n\nBefore move: segments: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,4) body, 2: (2,4) tail\n\nAfter move: head to (3,2), so new segment 0: (3,2)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to old seg0 position: (3,3)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old seg1 position: (3,4)\n\nAnd since food eaten, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so segment 3: (2,4)\n\nSo positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nNow, the tail is at (2,4), which is the new segment.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) is occupied by the tail.\n\nBut in the positions, (2,4) is part of the snake.\n\nNow, back to the point, in this path, I reached (3,2) on turn 8 and ate it.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 8 is 4 moves, but I started from turn 4 move to turn 8 move, so at turn 8 I ate.\n\nNow, if I had gone right at turn 4.\n\nOption 2: turn 4, move R to (4,5)\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] dir R\n\nTurn 5: say I go D to (4,4) to head towards (3,2)\n\nMove D to (4,4): new positions head (4,4), body (4,5), tail (3,5)  // dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), dir D, can go L, R, D (not U)\n\nGo L to (3,4)? (3,4) is currently occupied? Positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), tail (3,5), so (3,4) is empty.\n\nMove L to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,5)  // dir L\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), dir L, can go U, D, L (not R)\n\nGo D to (3,3)\n\nNew: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (4,4)  // dir D\n\nTurn 8: go D to (3,2), eat food, grow.\n\nSimilar, ate on turn 8.\n\nSo both paths reach (3,2) on turn 8.\n\nNow, but in both cases, I need to consider other foods and risks.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,4) and (6,6) that I might want to get later.\n\nMoreover, in the first option, when I went left, I ended up with the snake in a position where the tail is at (2,4) after eating, but that might not be bad.\n\nBut there is a risk with tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail yet.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (6,4) and (6,6) are on the right, so if I go right at turn 4, I might be closer to them.\n\nFor example, after going right to (4,5) at turn 4, instead of going down, I could go towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is at top-right, y=6.\n\nLife span: (6,6) life span 6 at turn 4, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n\n(6,4) by turn 10.\n\n(3,2) by turn 13.\n\nSince (6,6) has shorter life, I might prioritize it if I can reach it soon.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), to (6,6): Manhattan distance |dx|=3, |dy|=1, so 4 steps.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5) at turn 4.\n\nThen turn 5: go R to (5,5)\n\nNew: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)  // dir R\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5), dir R, can go U, D, R\n\nGo R to (6,5)\n\nNew: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)  // dir R\n\nNow, (6,5) is at x=6, which is border? Walls: x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable, since x from 1 to 6, x=6 ok, not wall.\n\ny=5 ok.\n\nNow, from (6,5), I need to go to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) is above, U.\n\nBut U to (6,6): y=6, x=6, should be free? Food is there, but cell is free until occupied.\n\n(6,6) has food, so moving to it eats.\n\nBut from (6,5), dir R, can go U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, which is the top row, not wall, no obstacle, so can go.\n\nTurn 7: go U to (6,6), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: before move, head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) and eat: new head (6,6), body at old head (6,5), body at old body (5,5), tail at old tail (4,5)? Since eat, add segment.\n\nBefore: seg0 (6,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (4,5) tail\n\nAfter: head to (6,6), so new seg0 (6,6)\n\nseg1 to old seg0 (6,5)\n\nseg2 to old seg1 (5,5)\n\nadd new seg3 at old tail (4,5)\n\nSo positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAte on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4): from (6,5), I could go D to (6,4) on turn 7.\n\n(6,4) has food, so eat.\n\nBut life span longer.\n\nNow, compare to going to (3,2): if I go to (6,6) first, I eat on turn 7, earlier than (3,2) on turn 8.\n\nBut (3,2) is closer in distance but I had to detour because of body.\n\nIn the direct path to (6,6), I ate on turn 7.\n\nNow, from turn 4 to turn 7, 3 moves: turn 4 R, turn 5 R, turn 6 R to (6,5), turn 7 U to (6,6).\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go to (6,4) from here: from (6,5), go D to (6,4) on turn 7, eat.\n\nBut (6,4) has longer life, so no rush.\n\nNow, back to turn 4 choice.\n\nIf I go left to (2,5), can I reach (6,6) quickly?\n\nFrom (2,5), to (6,6): |dx|=4, |dy|=1, so 5 steps, longer.\n\nTurn 4: to (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: say go R to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 4 L to (2,5), positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 5: if go R to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently the body segment? Positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so if I move to (3,5), collision with body segment.\n\nCannot go R to (3,5) because it's body.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n\nTo go right, I need to go down or up first.\n\nFor example, go D to (2,4) as before.\n\nThen from (2,4), go R to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut to reach (6,6), it would take more turns.\n\nMinimum from (2,5) to (6,6): need to go right 4 steps and up 1, but with turns.\n\nFor example: turn 5: go R not possible, so go D to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,4) dir D, go R to (3,4)\n\nNow positions: head (3,4), body (2,4), tail (2,5)  // after turn 6 move\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), can go R to (4,4) or U to (3,5) etc.\n\nGo R to (4,4)\n\nNew: head (4,4), body (3,4), tail (2,4)  // dir R\n\nTurn 8: go R to (5,4)\n\nNew: head (5,4), body (4,4), tail (3,4)  // dir R\n\nTurn 9: go R to (6,4) or to (6,6) but (6,4) is there, but let's go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), dir R, go U to (5,5)? To go up.\n\nU to (5,5): new head (5,5), body (5,4)? Before move head (5,4), body (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter to (5,5): head (5,5), body (5,4), tail (4,4)  // dir U\n\nThen turn 10: go U to (5,6) or R to (6,5), etc.\n\nTo (6,6): from (5,5), go R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) life span: at turn 4 life 6, so after turn 9 it disappears? Turn 4: life 6, can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: before move, if life span, at turn 9, before move, life span should be? At turn 4, life 6.\n\nAfter turn 4, life 5; ... after turn 8, life 1; turn 9 before move life 1, after move if not eaten, life 0 disappear.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nIn this path, at turn 10, if I go to (6,6), it might be gone.\n\nFrom above, at turn 9, I am at (5,5) or something.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 9, if I go to (6,5) on turn 10, but turn 10 is too late for (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) on turn 10, I could go to (6,6) only on turn 11 if not direct.\n\nBut turn 9 is the last chance.\n\nCan I reach (6,6) by turn 9 from left path?\n\nStart turn 4: go L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 5: go U to (2,6)  // top row\n\nNew: head (2,6), body (2,5), tail (3,5)  // dir U\n\nTurn 6: from (2,6), dir U, can go L, R, U? U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, not possible. L to (1,6), R to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, internal wall, so cannot.\n\nSo only L to (1,6)\n\nGo L to (1,6): new head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (2,5)  // dir L\n\nNow stuck in corner, far from foods.\n\nNot good.\n\nTurn 5 from (2,5) go D to (2,4)\n\nAs before, then to (3,4) on turn 6, then to (4,4) on turn 7, to (5,4) on turn 8, to (6,4) on turn 9? (6,4) can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nBut (6,6) not reachable by turn 9 from here easily.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) on turn 8, go U to (5,5) turn 9, then to (6,5) turn 10, but (6,6) gone.\n\nSo from the left path, it's hard to reach (6,6) in time for turn 9.\n\nWhereas from right path, I can reach (6,6) by turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) by turn 7 or later.\n\nNow, (3,2) can be eaten later, up to turn 13.\n\nSo prioritizing (6,6) might be better because it expires sooner.\n\nBut I need to consider survival.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut since all food is positive, growing is good for score.\n\nNow, another risk: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat food, the tail stays, so if there is food under the tail, but in this case, no.\n\nBut later, if food spawns under tail, etc., but for now, no such issue.\n\nAlso, in the grid, after moving, cells might be free.\n\nNow, for turn 4, if I go right to (4,5), I can head to (6,6) quickly and eat on turn 7.\n\nThen, after that, I can go to (6,4) or (3,2).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which from (6,6), I can go down to (6,5) or directly? From (6,6), after eating, positions say [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head dir U (since moved up to (6,6)).\n\nFrom (6,6), can go L, R, D (not U reverse).\n\nL to (5,6), R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, not possible. D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is currently body? Positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5), so (6,5) is occupied, cannot move there.\n\nD to (6,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nSimilarly, L to (5,6), which should be free? (5,6) x=5,y=6, not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\nThen go to (5,6).\n\nBut I want to go to (6,4) or (3,2).\n\n(6,4) is below, so from (6,6), I need to go down, but (6,5) is body, so I cannot go directly down.\n\nI have to go left or something.\n\nFor example, go L to (5,6) on turn 8.\n\nThen from there, I can go down, etc.\n\nBut to reach (6,4), it might take detour.\n\nSince (6,4) is at (6,4), and from current, I could go to it before (6,6).\n\nIn the right path, from turn 4 (4,5), I could go to (6,4) directly.\n\n(6,4) from (4,5): |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so 3 steps? But not straight.\n\nTurn 4: at (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: go D to (4,4)  // down\n\nNew: head (4,4), body (4,5), tail (3,5)  // dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), dir D, can go L, R, D\n\nGo R to (5,4)? Or directly to (6,4).\n\nGo R to (5,4): new head (5,4), body (4,4), tail (4,5)  // dir R\n\nTurn 7: go R to (6,4), eat food.\n\nYes, ate (6,4) on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone to (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nNow, for (3,2), I can go later.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (6,6) must be eaten by turn 9, (6,4) by turn 10, (3,2) by turn 13.\n\nSince I can eat (6,6) or (6,4) early, and (3,2) later, it might be fine.\n\nBut if I go left first to (3,2), I might miss (6,6) because of time.\n\nIn left path, I ate (3,2) on turn 8, but (6,6) expires turn 9, so from there I might not reach (6,6) in one turn.\n\nAfter eating (3,2) at turn 8, head at (3,2), positions say [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)] or something.\n\nTo go to (6,6), need to go right and up, many steps, e.g., to (4,2), (5,2), etc., but y=2 to y=6, 4 steps up, and x to 6, so minimum 6 steps, but turn 8 to turn 9 only one move, cannot reach by turn 9.\n\nSo if I go left first, I miss (6,6).\n\nWhereas if I go right first, I can eat both (6,6) and (6,4) or at least one, and still get (3,2) later.\n\n(3,2) has longer life.\n\nSo for maximizing score, going right allows me to get the expiring food.\n\nMoreover, by going right, I avoid the risk of not getting (6,6).\n\nNow, about risks: in the grid, with walls and obstacles, I need to not trap myself.\n\nFor example, after going to (6,6), the snake is longer, and I might be in a corner.\n\nBut since I can go left to (5,6), I can explore.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is in a more open area.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nI need to output for multiple turns, but the question is to output actions starting from turn t1=4.\n\nAnd think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo for turn 4, I should move R to (4,5).\n\nThen, as part of the plan, on turn 5, move R to (5,5), turn 6 move R to (6,5), turn 7 move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 6, at (6,5), I could instead go to (6,4) if I want, but (6,6) expires sooner, so better to get it first.\n\n(6,6) life 6 at turn 4, expires after turn 9, so turn 7 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I can get (6,4).\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" without specifying how many.\n\nProbably I need to output for the immediate actions as part of the plan.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I can output for, say, 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, for turn 4, move R.\n\nThen turn 5, move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6, move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7, move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 8, from (6,6), as above, I can go L to (5,6) since D and R not possible.\n\nGo to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,5), but (5,5) might be body, depending.\n\nAfter turn 7: positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head dir U.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6)\n\nNew: head (5,6), body (6,6), body (6,5), tail (5,5)? Before move: seg0 (6,6), seg1 (6,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (4,5) tail? After eating on turn 7, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,6): no eat, so new head (5,6), body at old head (6,6), body at old seg1 (6,5), tail at old seg2 (5,5), and old tail (4,5) gone.\n\nSo positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]  // tail at (5,5)\n\nHead dir L.\n\nNow, from (5,6), can go L, D, U? Dir L, so can go U, D, L (not R)\n\nU to (5,7) but y=7 wall, not possible.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently the tail? Positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), so (5,5) is tail.\n\nMoving to (5,5): since it's the tail cell, and we move onto it, but according to rules, \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if head moves to tail, it should be ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, head to (5,5), which is tail.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,5), then the tail moves to where? Before move: seg0 (5,6) head, seg1 (6,6), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (5,5) tail\n\nAfter head moves to (5,5): new head (5,5)\n\nThen seg1 moves to old seg0 position (5,6)\n\nSeg2 moves to old seg1 position (6,6)\n\nSeg3 moves to old seg2 position (6,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), body (6,6), tail (6,5)\n\nNo collision, and (5,5) was tail, but now it's head, and tail moved.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to get to (6,4) or (3,2).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is below (6,5).\n\nFrom current, after turn 8, head at (5,6) or if I go down.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, since I have to output actions, and think ahead, but for now, for turn 4, going right seems better.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left at turn 4, I get (3,2) but miss (6,6).\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should go right to get (6,6).\n\nMoreover, (6,4) is also available.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (3,2) might be under the body or something, but currently not, it's free.\n\nBut in the rules, food can spawn under body, but here it's given, so it's there.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nAlso, need to consider if moving to (4,5) is safe: yes, not wall, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think for turn 4, move R.\n\nThen for the plan, I can output turns 4,5,6,7 actions to get to (6,6).\n\nBut on turn 6 at (6,5), I move U to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) might have food with life span, but it does.\n\nNow, after that, I can plan to get other food, but since the output might not need all, I can do for 4 turns or so.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably I need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut it doesn't say how many, so I should do for the immediate moves in the plan.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, output for 5 turns.\n\nt1=4, so turns 4 to 8 or 9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps for this case, moving R on turn 4.\n\nThen for turn 5, move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6, move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7, move U to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 8, move L to (5,6) or D not possible, so L to (5,6)\n\nBut I don't have to specify beyond, but to show the plan.\n\nIn the answer format, it might be fine to output the actions for the next few turns.\n\nSince the food at (3,2) is still there, I can go down later.\n\nBut to be complete.\n\nAnother point: in the beginning, when I move, I need to ensure no tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat (6,6), the tail is at (4,5), not adjacent, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think going right is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nSnake head direction: current at turn 4, direction is U, since moving up previously.\n\nAfter moving R, direction becomes R.\n\nThen moving R again, etc.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 4 to 8). The key considerations are:\n- **Prioritize food with shorter life spans**: Food at (6,6) has a life span of 6 (disappears after turn 9), while (6,4) has life span 7 (disappears after turn 10) and (3,2) has life span 10 (disappears after turn 13). Eating (6,6) early is critical to avoid missing it.\n- **Avoid risks**: The snake must avoid walls, body collisions, and tail reward danger. Moving right initially positions the snake to reach (6,6) quickly without immediate dangers.\n- **Efficiency**: The path to (6,6) via (4,5) → (5,5) → (6,5) → (6,6) is safe and achievable in 4 moves (turns 4-7). After eating (6,6), the snake can pursue other food.\n\n### Plan Details (Turns 4-8):\n- **Turn 4 (current)**: Move R (right) to (4,5).  \n  - Why: From (3,5), moving left (to (2,5)) risks missing (6,6) due to distance and obstacles. Moving right avoids body collision and walls, and starts the path to high-priority food. Direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (right) to (5,5).  \n  - Why: Continuing right maintains momentum toward (6,6). (5,5) is safe (not wall or body). Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move R (right) to (6,5).  \n  - Why: (6,5) is safe and adjacent to (6,6). Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move U (up) to (6,6).  \n  - Why: Eat positive food at (6,6) (score +1, length +1). This must be done by turn 9; achieving it here is efficient. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 8**: Move L (left) to (5,6).  \n  - Why: From (6,6), moving down to (6,5) causes body collision (occupied by body segment), and right to (7,6) is a wall. Left to (5,6) is safe and opens paths to other food like (6,4) or (3,2) later. Direction changes to L.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 8):\n- After turn 8, the snake can target (6,4) or (3,2). (6,4) can be reached by moving down from (5,6) to (5,5) (if safe) and then right to (6,5), but must avoid body collisions. (3,2) is safer with more life span; a path like (5,6) → (5,5) → (5,4) → ... can be used.\n- **Risks mitigated**: \n  - No tail reward danger: At no point is the head adjacent to the tail with food on the tail cell.\n  - Body/wall collisions avoided: All moves steer clear of walls and body segments.\n  - Food access: (6,6) is secured early, and the snake remains flexible for other food.\n\nThis plan scores at least +1 by turn 7 with minimal risk, and positions the snake for further gains.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 8: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then body at (3,5), and tail at (3,4). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,6) with life span 5 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 6 and value +1\n\n- (3,2) with life span 9 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current one, so I need to consider when they disappear.\n\nCurrent turn is 5, so:\n\n- Food at (6,6) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let me read the life-span rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 5, life span is given as 5 for (6,6). That means it will disappear at the end of turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Or does it disappear when countdown reaches 0?\n\nLet's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn t, when we process, the life span decreases by 1 for that turn. If life span is N on turn t, it decreases to N-1 at the end of turn t, and disappears when it reaches 0.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think of life span as the remaining number of turns it will be present. So for food at (6,6), life span 5 on turn 5 means:\n\n- After turn 5, life span becomes 4 (if not eaten)\n\n- After turn 6, becomes 3\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 9, becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 10 or at the start of turn 10? The rule doesn't specify exactly when it disappears.\n\nTo be precise: \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it exists for N full turns after it spawns. But here, we're given the current life span.\n\nAssume that on turn t, with life span L, the food will disappear after L more turns, meaning at the end of turn t + L or start of turn t + L + 1? I need to be consistent.\n\nSince the countdown decreases every turn including current, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0, I think:\n\n- On turn t, with life span L, after the turn, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1.\n\n- When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nFor planning, I should consider how many turns it will be available.\n\nFor simplicity, let's say food with life span L on turn t will be available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L. So it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor (6,6) at turn 5, life span 5: available on turns 5,6,7,8,9; disappears turn 10.\n\n(6,4) life span 6: available turns 5 to 10.\n\n(3,2) life span 9: available turns 5 to 13.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), moving right. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But since current direction is R, I cannot move left (opposite) on the next turn? The rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo current direction is R, so on turn 5, I can move U, D, or R, but not L (left).\n\nSimilarly, after moving, the direction changes.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4). So it's like the head is at (4,5), just moved right from (3,5), I assume, since direction is R.\n\nFrom positions: from (3,4) to (3,5) to (4,5), so the snake was moving up to (3,5), then right to (4,5). So current direction is R.\n\nFood: (6,6), (6,4), (3,2)\n\n(6,6) is at top-right, (6,4) is bottom-right, (3,2) is bottom-left.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Usually in grids, y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be specified.\n\nThe walls: y=0 and y=7, with internal at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6.\n\nSnake at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So y=4 and y=5, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so (4,5) is above (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- Up (U): to (4,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,4)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5) but (3,5) is the body segment, so moving left would be into the body, which is collision? But rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (3,5) is the body segment, not the tail. Tail is (3,4).\n\nSo moving to (3,5) would be colliding with body, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, right (R) to (5,5), which is empty.\n\nDown to (4,4): (4,4) is empty? Current positions: snake at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So (4,4) is free? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,6)\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2) – but food is not obstacle, snake can move there to eat, but only if head moves on it.\n\nFor movement, cells to avoid: walls and body segments except tail under certain conditions.\n\nSpecifically, moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and the snake moves away, but in this case, (3,5) is not tail, it's the second segment.\n\nTail is (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,6): what is (4,6)? Not wall, not snake, not obstacle. (3,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is different. x=4,y=6. Walls only border and (3,6), so (4,6) should be free.\n\n- D to (4,4): (4,4) is empty, no snake or wall.\n\n- L to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\n- R to (5,5): (5,5) should be empty.\n\nAlso, cannot move L because it's opposite to current direction R? \"No instant reverse\" means I cannot move opposite on the next turn. Current direction is R, so moving L is opposite, so invalid move or causes collision? The rule says \"cannot move opposite\", so I think it's not allowed, so L is not an option.\n\nSimilarly, U, D, R are possible.\n\nNow, (4,6): is it safe? No immediate wall or body.\n\nBut let's check the grid.\n\nGrid rows and columns: assume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(4,6): x=4, y=6. Border walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,6) has y=6, which is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle only (3,6), so (4,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): x=4,y=4, free.\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5, free.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R (since L not allowed and would be fatal anyway).\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood: (6,6) available turns 5-9, (6,4) turns 5-10, (3,2) turns 5-13.\n\nCurrent turn 5.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards food.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is 2 steps right and 1 up from (4,5)? From (4,5) to (6,6): need to move right twice and up once, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), which is 2 right and 1 down.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is left and down, but left is not possible now.\n\nNow, tail is at (3,4), and there's food at (3,2), which is below.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) might take time.\n\nAlso, note the special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,4), no food there. Food is at (3,2), which is not on tail.\n\nNow, let's plan possible paths.\n\nFirst, I should simulate a few moves.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nTurn 5: snake positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4). Direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6):\n\nThen new head (4,6), body: head was (4,5) becomes first body, then (3,5) becomes second body, tail (3,4) moves? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed from old position.\n\nSo after move U to (4,6): new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5) [previous head], then (3,5) [previous first body], and tail (3,4) is gone? Positions: originally [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,6), the body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was? Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (4,6)\n\n- The segment that was at (3,5) moves to (4,5) [previous head position]\n\n- The segment that was at (3,4) moves to (3,5) [previous position of first body segment]\n\nAnd the cell (3,4) is now empty, since tail moved.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection now U.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (4,4): new positions [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nIf move R to (5,5): new positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, no food eaten in these moves, since no head on food.\n\nNow, food at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2) still there.\n\nLife span decreases after the turn, I assume.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which is near.\n\n(3,6) is blocked, so from (4,6), I cannot go to (3,6).\n\nNow, let's consider each option.\n\nFirst, move R to (5,5) on turn 5.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, so collision, and L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. So U, D, R possible.\n\n(6,5) is empty, etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is food, (6,4) is food.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (6,6), I need to go right to (6,5) then up to (6,6), or up to (5,6) then right to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) has life span 5, available until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) available until turn 10.\n\n(3,2) available longer.\n\nBut moving right might be good to get to the food faster.\n\nBut let's see risks.\n\nAnother option: move U to (4,6) on turn 5.\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot, collision.\n\nD to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (3,6), but (3,6) is internal obstacle, so wall, collision.\n\nR to (5,6), which should be free.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,6) is R to (5,6).\n\nBecause U, D, L all blocked or fatal.\n\nU to (4,7): y=7 is border wall, so death.\n\nD to (4,5): occupied by body, death.\n\nL to (3,6): obstacle, death.\n\nR to (5,6): x=5,y=6, not border, not obstacle, not snake, so should be ok.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 5 to (4,6), then on turn 6, I must move R to (5,6), no choice.\n\nThen on turn 6, after moving to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7), but y=7 wall, death.\n\nD to (5,5), which is empty? Current positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), so (5,5) is free.\n\nL to (4,6), but (4,6) is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,6), which has food.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), no growth.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\n(6,6) life span 5 on turn 5, after turn 5, it decreases to 4 for turn 6, and so on.\n\nOn turn 6, if I move to (6,6), I eat it.\n\nIf not, it might disappear later, but life span 4 after turn 6, meaning available until turn 9? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt start of turn 5, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 5, if not eaten, life span becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 6, if not eaten, life span 3, and so on, down to 0.\n\nSo on turn t, with initial life span L, after k turns, life span is L - k.\n\nIt can be eaten as long as life span > 0.\n\nFor (6,6): on turn 5, life span 5; turn 6, 4; turn 7, 3; turn 8, 2; turn 9, 1; turn 10, 0, gone.\n\nSo can be eaten on turns 5 to 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIf on turn 5 I move U to (4,6), then on turn 6 I must move R to (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 7, from (5,6), I can move R to (6,6) to eat food, or D to (5,5).\n\nIf I eat on turn 7, snake grows to length 4.\n\nPositions: before move, head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5)\n\nMove R to (6,6): eat food, so head moves to (6,6), and tail does not move, so new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) — length 4.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, L, but L to (5,6) is body, collision, and opposite to R? Current direction R, L is opposite, so not allowed. So possible U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,7): y=7 wall, death.\n\nD to (6,5)\n\nR to (7,6): x=7 wall, death.\n\nSo only possible move D to (6,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, this path forces me to go to (5,6) on turn 6, then I can choose to eat or not on turn 7.\n\nBut eating on turn 7 is possible since life span still 3 or so.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nNow, another option on turn 5: move D to (4,4).\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (4,3), which should be free? y=3, not wall.\n\nL to (3,4), (3,4) is empty? Previously tail was at (3,4), but moved, so free.\n\nR to (5,4), free.\n\nAlso, current direction D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed? U is up, opposite to down, so cannot move U.\n\nSo possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nAll possible.\n\nFood at (6,4) and (3,2).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is right and down from (4,4)? (4,4) to (6,4) is 2 right.\n\n(3,2) is left and down.\n\nBut (3,2) has longer life span.\n\nNow, third option: move R on turn 5 to (5,5).\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision, and L opposite to R, not allowed. So U, D, R.\n\n(5,6) free, (5,4) free, (6,5) free.\n\nFood at (6,6) and (6,4) nearby.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) then (6,6), or to (6,5) then (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) from (5,5) go D to (5,4) then R to (6,4), etc.\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n\nThe grid has limited space, and with walls and obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area near (4,6) is tricky because of the obstacle at (3,6) and walls.\n\nIn fact, if I go to (4,6), I am forced to go to (5,6), then I have to go to (6,6) or (5,5), but if I go to (6,6), then I must go to (6,5), and so on.\n\nLet's map the grid.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nAlso internal obstacle (3,6).\n\nSo for example, row y=6: cells (0,6) to (7,6), but x=0 and x=7 walls, and (3,6) obstacle, so free cells: (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is food, but can be occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other areas.\n\nSnake is small, length 3, so plenty of space.\n\nBut I need to plan to eat food without dying.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,2) might be easier to get later.\n\nNow, let's consider the risk of going up.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6) on turn 5, then I must go R to (5,6) on turn 6.\n\nThen on turn 7, from (5,6), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I eat, grow to length 4, then must go D to (6,5) on turn 7? Turn 7 move.\n\nAfter eating on turn 7, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) — assume turn 6 positions were head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) on turn 7: eat, so new head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), and (4,5) since tail doesn't move, so positions [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection from (5,6) to (6,6) is R, so direction R.\n\nNow from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) body, collision, R to (7,6) wall. So only D to (6,5).\n\nMove D to (6,5) on turn 8? Turn 7 I moved to (6,6), so on turn 8, move to (6,5).\n\nNew head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — tail (4,5) is gone? When moving to (6,5), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPositions: head to (6,5), body segments to previous positions: so (6,6) becomes body, (5,6) becomes next, (4,6) becomes tail, (4,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6) but (6,6) is body, collision. D to (6,4), which has food. L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall.\n\nCurrent direction D, so U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: D to (6,4), L to (5,5).\n\n(6,4) has food, (5,5) is free.\n\nIf I go to (6,4), I eat, grow.\n\nLife span of (6,4) is 6 on turn 5, on turn 8, how many turns passed? Turn 5,6,7,8: 4 turns, so life span decreased to 6-4=2, still available.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head to (6,4), eat, so new head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — length 4.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut I am near the wall, might be trapped.\n\nIf from (6,5) I go to (5,5) instead, but (5,5) might be free.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid this path.\n\nBack to turn 5, if I move D to (4,4) instead.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (4,4): positions [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,4), possible moves: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4). Cannot U, opposite and body.\n\n(4,3) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) free.\n\nFood at (6,4) is close.\n\nFor example, I can go R to (5,4) on turn 6, then to (6,4) on turn 7 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is down left.\n\nBut let's consider moving R on turn 5 to (5,5).\n\nPositions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6, from (5,5), possible U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5).\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, (6,6) can be reached by going U to (5,6) then R to (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nOr directly if possible, but from (5,5) to (6,6) not adjacent.\n\n(6,4) can be reached by D to (5,4) then R to (6,4).\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is farther.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, I should aim to eat multiple foods.\n\nBut with the snake growing, space decreases.\n\nAlso, the tail might be a issue later.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is on (3,2), which is below the internal obstacle.\n\nThe snake tail is at (3,4) initially, but moving.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (6,4) first since it's closer and has longer life span? (6,4) life span 6 vs (6,6) life span 5, but both similar.\n\n(3,2) life span 9, longer.\n\nBut let's see the board layout.\n\nThe right side has two foods, (6,6) and (6,4), both at x=6.\n\nx=6 is not wall, but x=7 is wall, so (6,y) is ok for y not 0 or 7.\n\n(6,6) and (6,4) are both at edge.\n\nIf I eat them, I might be trapped near the wall.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,6), I had to go to (6,5), then to (6,4) or (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,4), I eat, then at (6,4), with body around.\n\nPositions after eating (6,4): head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) for example.\n\nThen from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) body, collision; D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall. Current direction, when moving to (6,4), from previous, say from (6,5) to (6,4), direction D, so U opposite not allowed, so only D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) free, (5,4) free.\n\nThen I can continue down or left.\n\nBut the area might be cramped.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps I should not go for the right foods first.\n\nGo for (3,2) instead.\n\nBut from current position (4,5), to go to (3,2), I need to go left and down, but left is not possible now.\n\nSo I need to go down or right first.\n\nMove D to (4,4) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go L to (3,4) on turn 6, then from (3,4) to (3,3) or (2,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) might be body.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (4,4): positions [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 6, from (4,4), move L to (3,4): (3,4) is free, so new positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? Positions: body segments (4,4) and (4,5), so (3,5) is free? (4,5) is at (4,5), not (3,5).\n\nCells: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is empty, U to (3,5) possible.\n\nD to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision, and R opposite to L? Current direction L, R opposite not allowed.\n\nSo possible U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\n(3,5) free, (3,3) free, (2,4) free.\n\nFood at (3,2) is below, so I can go D to (3,3) on turn 7, then D to (3,2) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nLife span of (3,2) is 9 on turn 5, on turn 8, life span 9-3=6, still available.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so from (3,5) I cannot go up to (3,6), it's blocked.\n\nSo from (3,4), if I go U to (3,5), then at (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) obstacle, death; D to (3,4) body, collision; L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but (4,5) may be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 6 positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5)\n\nIf on turn 7 move U to (3,5): new head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), and tail (4,5) moved? No food, so positions [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (3,5), moves: U to (3,6) wall, death; D to (3,4) body, collision; L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nCurrent direction U, so D opposite not allowed.\n\nL and R possible.\n\n(2,5) free, (4,5) free.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) was previously occupied, but now free since snake moved.\n\nSo it's possible.\n\nBut for eating (3,2), better to go down from (3,4).\n\nOn turn 7 from (3,4) move D to (3,3).\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,3), move D to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nEat, so new positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — length 4.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) body, collision; D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nCurrent direction D, so U opposite not allowed.\n\nSo D to (3,1), but y=1 not wall, (3,1) free? y=0 is wall, so y=1 ok.\n\nL to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nAll possible.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nThis seems safe.\n\nBut I missed the other foods.\n\n(6,6) disappears after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10.\n\nBy turn 8, I have eaten (3,2), so on turn 8 or later.\n\nTurn 5,6,7,8: on turn 8 I eat (3,2).\n\nThen (6,6) can be eaten until turn 9, so I might have time to go right.\n\nBut from (3,2) to (6,6) is far, and snake is longer, might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) after eating, positions [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nI can move R to (4,2) on turn 9, then to (5,2), etc., but to reach (6,6) by turn 9, I need to move quickly.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (6,6) is 2 right and 4 up, many moves, but only one turn left for (6,6), turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, if I am not at (6,6), I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) available until turn 10.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nIf I go for the right food first.\n\nOn turn 5 move R to (5,5).\n\nThen positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6, I can move U to (5,6).\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 7, from (5,6), move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\nEat, grow to length 4: positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen as before, must move D to (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) — tail (4,5) gone.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9, from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat (6,4).\n\nEat, grow: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (6,4), move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I ate two foods, score +2.\n\nThen I can go down or left.\n\nBut the snake is at the bottom right, might be ok.\n\nOn turn 5, if I move U to (4,6), I am forced to go to (5,6) on turn 6, then on turn 7 I can eat (6,6) or go to (5,5).\n\nIf I eat on turn 7, similar to above.\n\nBut in the move R on turn 5, I have more flexibility on turn 6.\n\nIn move U on turn 5, I am forced to go right on turn 6.\n\nSo move U is riskier because it limits options.\n\nMove D to (4,4) allows me to go for (3,2) or (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is closer from there? From (4,4), I can go to (5,4) then (6,4) in two moves.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2) in three moves down.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating both (6,6) and (6,4) might be possible if I go right.\n\nBut (6,6) disappears after turn 9, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nIn the path above, I can eat (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nThen (6,4) on turn 9.\n\nIn between, on turn 8, I moved to (6,5).\n\nNow, what about the food at (3,2)? I might not get it, but it has long life span, I can get it later if possible.\n\nBut with snake longer, and walls, it might be hard.\n\nPerhaps I can get (3,2) first, then see.\n\nBut from current position, going for (3,2) takes more turns, and I might miss the right foods.\n\n(6,6) and (6,4) are both at x=6, so I can eat them in sequence.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,6) might block some paths, but since I'm at (4,5), moving down or right might be better.\n\nAnother risk: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable now.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has a potential dead end on the right if I go there, but I can escape down.\n\nFor example, after eating both, at (6,4), I can go to (6,3), (6,2), etc., or left to (5,4), then down or left.\n\nThe left side has more space.\n\n(3,2) is at bottom left.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (3,6), the top left might be restricted.\n\ny=6 has (3,6) blocked, so row y=6 has gaps.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nNow, to decide: I think moving right on turn 5 is good to approach the food.\n\nThen I can eat (6,6) on turn 7 as above.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down, I can go for (6,4) faster.\n\nFrom (4,4), to (6,4) is two moves: e.g., turn 6 to (5,4), turn 7 to (6,4) eat.\n\nWhereas from (4,5) moving down to (4,4), then to (5,4) on turn 6, to (6,4) on turn 7.\n\nSame as from (5,5) going to (5,4) then (6,4).\n\nBut from (5,5), I can also go to (6,6) via (5,6).\n\nIf I move R on turn 5 to (5,5), I have the option to go up to (5,6) or down to (5,4) on turn 6.\n\nThen I can choose to eat (6,6) or (6,4).\n\n(6,6) has shorter life, so better to eat it first if possible.\n\nLife span: (6,6) available turns 5-9, (6,4) turns 5-10, so (6,6) is more urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) not urgent.\n\nSo prioritize eating (6,6) soon.\n\nTo eat (6,6) from (4,5):\n\n- Via (4,6): move U turn 5, then R turn 6 to (5,6), then R turn 7 to (6,6) eat.\n\n- Via (5,5): move R turn 5 to (5,5), then U turn 6 to (5,6), then R turn 7 to (6,6) eat. Or directly from (5,5) to (6,5) then U to (6,6), but that takes an extra move.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,6) not adjacent, so must go through (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is one move, (6,5) to (6,6) is one move, but (6,5) not food.\n\nFastest to (6,6) is in two moves: e.g., to (5,6) then to (6,6).\n\nFrom current (4,5), to (5,6) is not adjacent, so minimum two moves to reach (6,6): e.g., to (5,5) then (5,6) then (6,6), three moves? From (4,5) to (5,5) is one move (R), then to (5,6) is second move (U), then to (6,6) third move (R). So three moves to eat.\n\nSimilarly, via (4,6): (4,5) to (4,6) U, then to (5,6) R, then to (6,6) R, also three moves, eating on turn 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 5 move to intermediate, turn 6 to another, turn 7 to food.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4): from (4,5) to (4,4) D, then to (5,4) R, then to (6,4) R, eat on turn 7.\n\nOr from (5,5) to (5,4) D, then to (6,4) R.\n\nSame.\n\nBut for (6,6), if I move U on turn 5, I must go to (5,6) on turn 6, then I can eat on turn 7.\n\nIf I move R on turn 5, I can go to (5,6) on turn 6, eat on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut with move U, I am committed, no choice on turn 6.\n\nWith move R, I have choice on turn 6 to go up or down.\n\nFor example, on turn 6 from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,5), then to (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nBut (6,5) not food.\n\nSo to eat (6,6), going to (5,6) is better.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (6,6), I can eat (6,4) as in earlier simulation.\n\nThen I have two foods, and I can go for (3,2) later if possible.\n\nBut (3,2) life span 9, available until turn 13, so after turn 8 or 9, I can head left.\n\nFor example, after eating both right foods, at (6,4) with length 5 or so, I can move left to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc., towards (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,2) is 3 left and 2 down, so several moves.\n\nBut with life span until turn 13, on turn 10, I can be there.\n\nTurn 10 - turn 5 = 5 turns, I can cover distance.\n\nBut with growing snake, need to avoid self-collision.\n\nSince the grid is open, it should be possible.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (3,6) might not affect bottom.\n\ny=2 is low, y=6 high.\n\nSo moving to bottom left should be fine.\n\nTherefore, I think moving right on turn 5 is a good start.\n\nThen on turn 6, move up to (5,6) to approach (6,6).\n\nThen eat on turn 7.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should show actions starting from current turn.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. I think I need to provide a sequence, but since it's a simulation, I should provide until a decision point or for 5 turns.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll provide for the next few turns where I have a plan.\n\nSince I'm to think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nFor this state, I can plan to eat (6,6) and (6,4).\n\nSo on turn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5), move U to (5,6)  // to approach (6,6)\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), move R to (6,6) eat\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), must move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), move D to (6,4) eat\n\nThen after that, I can move L to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut on turn 9, I eat (6,4), so positions grow.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify actions up to turn t1+ something.\n\nt1=5, so I can output turns 5 to 9.\n\nThen the snake has eaten two foods.\n\nAfter that, I can go for (3,2).\n\nBut since the format might expect a sequence, I'll provide for 5 turns: turns 5 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 8, I move to (6,5), which is not eating, but necessary.\n\nOn turn 9, I eat (6,4).\n\n(6,4) life span 6, on turn 9, after 4 turns decreased, life span 2, available.\n\nTurn 5: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 5: 5\n\nTurn 6: 4\n\nTurn 7: 3\n\nTurn 8: 2\n\nTurn 9: 1, so on turn 9 I can eat it.\n\nIf I don't, it disappears turn 10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nNow, what about moving down? If I move down on turn 5, I might miss (6,6).\n\nFor example, move D to (4,4) turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6, if I go to (5,4), turn 7 to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut to get to (6,6), from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) then to (6,6), but (6,6) might be gone or almost gone.\n\nOn turn 7, after eating (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,5)? When moving to (6,4) from say (5,4), but let's not.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (6,5) is possible, but on turn 8 move to (6,5), then turn 9 to (6,6) if still there.\n\nBut (6,6) life span: on turn 9, life span 1, available, so I can eat on turn 9.\n\nBut from (6,4) to (6,6) requires going to (6,5) first, which is one move, then to (6,6).\n\nBut on turn 7 I am at (6,4), turn 8 to (6,5), turn 9 to (6,6) eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nBut in this case, I eat (6,4) on turn 7, (6,6) on turn 9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut with move R on turn 5, I eat (6,6) first then (6,4).\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut with move U on turn 5, I might be forced.\n\nSo I think move R on turn 5 is better.\n\nThen I can choose.\n\nAlso, in the move R, on turn 6 I can go to (5,6) to target (6,6).\n\nNow, for the output, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 5: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 6: U (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (6,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 8: D (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 9: D (to (6,4) eat)\n\nThen after that, I can go left or down.\n\nBut since the food at (3,2) is still available, I can head towards it.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing 5 actions is fine.\n\nThe current turn is t1=5, so turns 5 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 8, I move to (6,5), no eat, then turn 9 to (6,4) eat.\n\nI could on turn 8 from (6,5) go to (5,5) instead of down, but (5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the positions, after turn 7, snake is at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) after eating.\n\nThen turn 8 move D to (6,5): no eat, so positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — tail (4,5) gone.\n\n(5,5) is free, so from (6,5) I could move L to (5,5) on turn 8 instead of D.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut if I move to (5,5), I might not be able to eat (6,4) immediately.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (5,5) I can go D to (5,4) then R to (6,4), but that takes two moves.\n\nWhereas from (6,5), going directly D to (6,4) is one move.\n\nAnd since (6,4) is available, better to eat it directly.\n\nMoreover, moving to (5,5) might be riskier if the body is there, but not.\n\nSo moving D to (6,4) is efficient.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is good.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nBut turn 9 is D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nNow, I should confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, on turn 8, moving D from (6,5) to (6,4) is down, direction D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut the format says \"action on turn\", and action in {U, D, L, R}.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I think 5 turns are enough to show the plan.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but outputting the actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated the next 5+ turns. The key considerations are:\n- The snake must eat positive food (all available food is +1) to grow and increase score.\n- Food at (6,6) has a life span of 5 (available until turn 9), making it urgent to eat soon.\n- Food at (6,4) has a life span of 6 (available until turn 10), and food at (3,2) has a life span of 9 (available until turn 13), so they can be targeted later.\n- Moving up (U) from (4,5) is risky due to limited escape routes near the obstacle at (3,6) and walls, potentially leading to dead ends.\n- Moving down (D) allows access to (6,4) or (3,2) but may miss (6,6) due to its shorter life span.\n- Moving right (R) provides flexibility to reach both (6,6) and (6,4) efficiently while avoiding immediate risks.\n\nThe optimal path is to:\n1. Move right (R) on turn 5 to (5,5), positioning to approach (6,6).\n2. Move up (U) on turn 6 to (5,6), setting up to eat (6,6) next turn.\n3. Move right (R) on turn 7 to (6,6), eating the food and growing to length 4.\n4. Move down (D) on turn 8 to (6,5), avoiding walls and body collisions.\n5. Move down (D) on turn 9 to (6,4), eating the food and growing to length 5.\n\nThis sequence eats two positive foods by turn 9, maximizing early score. After turn 9, the snake can head toward (3,2) (available until turn 13) by moving left/down, ensuring long-term survival in the open grid.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: R (right)  \nTurn 6: U (up)  \nTurn 7: R (right)  \nTurn 8: D (down)  \nTurn 9: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then body at (4,5), and tail at (3,5). So the snake is horizontal, moving right, since head direction is R. That means the head is at (5,5), and it's going to (6,5) if it continues right, but I need to decide the action.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 6, life spans are given; for (6,6), life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, so at turn 10 it's gone. Similarly, (6,4) life span 5, disappears at turn 11, and (3,2) life span 8, disappears at turn 14.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 11 or so.\n\nCurrent snake length is 3, since there are three positions.\n\nHead direction is R, so if I move right, head goes to (6,5). But (6,5) is not a wall? Walls are borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=7 is wall, so (7,5) would be wall, but (6,5) is within bounds. y=5 is fine.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So (6,5) is valid, not a wall.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), which is not near the snake right now.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is R, reverse would be L, so I cannot move L immediately. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nIf I move R, head goes to (6,5).\n\nIf U, to (5,6).\n\nIf D, to (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to consider the food and plan ahead.\n\nFood at (6,6), (6,4), and (3,2).\n\n(6,6) is up-right from head, (6,4) is down-right, and (3,2) is far left and down.\n\nSince head is at (5,5), moving right to (6,5) gets me closer to both (6,6) and (6,4).\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to (6,6) above and (6,4) below.\n\nAlso, (6,5) might be a cell I can move to? Is it empty? Snake positions are (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), so (6,5) is free. No food there, just a possible move.\n\nIf I go to (6,5), then from there I can go to (6,6) or (6,4) or (7,5) but (7,5) is wall since x=7 is border, so cannot go there. x=7 is wall, so from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L to (5,5), but (5,5) will be the body after I move.\n\nLet's simulate the movement.\n\nCurrent turn t=6, snake: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). Direction R.\n\nIf I choose action for turn 6.\n\nSay I move R: head moves to (6,5). Then body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was, (5,5), and (3,5) moves to (4,5). Tail was at (3,5), so after move, new positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5). Tail is now at (4,5).\n\nLength increases only if I eat food, which I don't in this move.\n\nNow, food at (6,6) has life span 4, so after this turn, at turn 7, life span decreases to 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nI should consider paths to the food.\n\nFirst, (6,6) and (6,4) are both close, at distance 1 in Manhattan terms.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), head at (5,5), so to go to (6,6), I need to move up then right, or right then up, but since I'm at (5,5), moving right to (6,5) then up to (6,6) is direct.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4): right to (6,5) then down to (6,4).\n\nOr I could move down to (5,4) first, but (5,4) might be free? Snake is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), so (5,4) is free.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (5,5), moving down to (5,4) gets closer, then right to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) from (5,5) up to (5,6), then right to (6,6).\n\nBut (5,6) and (5,4) are both possible moves.\n\nNow, also, the food at (3,2) is farther, and has longer life span, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks. For example, if I go for (6,6), I need to be careful about the tail.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,5), and there's no food there. Food is at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2), not at tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, and internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is occupied, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, possible actions at turn 6: U, D, R (since no L, reverse not allowed).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5): then at (6,5), I can on next turn move U to (6,6) to eat food, or D to (6,4) to eat, or L back to (5,5), but (5,5) is now body, so if I move L to (5,5), I collide with body, which is deadly.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (5,5) from (6,5) would be moving left to a body cell, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (7,5) is wall, impossible.\n\nSo from (6,5), only possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,6) has food, (6,4) has food.\n\nIf I go U to (6,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: head to (6,6), then body segments: the body was at (5,5), moves to (6,5)? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 6: if I moved R to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5). Food not eaten.\n\nTurn 7: if I move U to (6,6), which has food. So head moves to (6,6), and since I eat food, a new segment is added, so body segments: the tail doesn't move, instead, a new tail is added where tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the body moves.\n\nPositions: before move, snake at [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] head at (6,5).\n\nMove head to (6,6), which has food, so now head is at (6,6), and the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was (6,5), second to where it was, but since eating, a new segment is added.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new cell, if food, length increases, so tail doesn't move; if no food, tail moves forward.\n\nIn this case: moving to (6,6) which has food, so after move: head at (6,6), then the previous positions: body was (5,5) moves to (6,5), and (4,5) stays? No.\n\nList: previous positions: head (6,5), body1 (5,5), body2/tail (4,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (6,6) and eating food: new head at (6,6), then the body segments remain, but a new segment is added. Since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,6), then the previous head becomes body, so (6,5) is now body, then (5,5) is still body, and (4,5) is tail. So snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 4.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (6,4) instead.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 choices.\n\nIf I move U at turn 6: from (5,5) to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free? Snake is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), walls: y=7 is wall, so (5,6) is within bounds, x=5,y=6, not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (5,6).\n\nSo move U to (5,6). Then positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)? Previous body (4,5) moves to (5,5), tail (3,5) moves to (4,5). So snake: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nFrom there, I can move to (6,6) to eat, or other directions.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (5,4): head to (5,4), body to (5,5), tail to (4,5).\n\nThen I can go to (6,4) to eat.\n\nNow, I need to think about which food to go for first and the life spans.\n\n(6,6) life span 4: disappears at turn 10 (since at turn 6, life span 4, so after 4 turns, gone at turn 10).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 5, disappears at turn 11.\n\n(3,2) life span 8, disappears at turn 14.\n\nSince I'm at (5,5), both (6,6) and (6,4) are within 2 moves, so I can reach them easily.\n\nBut I should consider the tail position and future movements to avoid collision.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect paths later.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nOption 1: Move R at turn 6 to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 7, I have to move either U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) because other moves are invalid.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), I eat the food at (6,6), snake grows to length 4: positions head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nNow, at turn 7, after eating, life span of that food decreases, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nFood at (6,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, remaining food: (6,4) and (3,2).\n\nAt turn 7, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nHead direction: I moved U, so direction is now U.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,6), I can go U, D, L, R? But y=7 is wall above, so (6,7) is wall, cannot go U. x=6, y=7 is out of bounds, y=7 is wall, so cannot move up.\n\nCan move D to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nCan move L to (5,6), which might be free? Current positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,6) is empty? (5,6) not occupied, no wall, so can move L to (5,6).\n\nCan move R to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nSo I must move L to (5,6).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,6), body moves: (6,6) to (6,5)? After moving head to (5,6), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nMove head to (5,6), no food there, so head moves to (5,6), then body: first body segment moves to where head was (6,6), but (6,6) is now empty? Positions shift: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,6)? Let's think.\n\nStandard: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: head was at (6,6), moves to (5,6). Then the body segment that was at (6,5) moves to where head was, but head moved to (5,6), so it moves to (6,6)? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the segment after head moves to the previous head position, and so on.\n\nAfter move: head now at (5,6). The segment that was immediately after head was at (6,5), so it moves to the previous head position (6,6). Then the next segment was at (5,5), so it moves to (6,5). Then tail was at (4,5), moves to (5,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5)? List: positions: head (5,6), then body segments: the first body segment is now at (6,6) (previous head), second body segment at (6,5) (where the first body was), and tail at (5,5) (where the second body was). Tail was at (4,5), which moved to (5,5).\n\nSo snake: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nNow, tail at (5,5).\n\nNow, at this point, I can move from (5,6). Possible moves: U: (5,7) but y=7 wall, impossible. D: to (5,5) but (5,5) is tail, but I can move to tail position? Rule: \"can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (5,5) is possible because tail will move away.\n\nSimilarly, L: to (4,6), or R: to (6,6) but (6,6) is body now, collision.\n\n(6,6) is body, so cannot move there.\n\nU impossible.\n\nD to (5,5): possible, since tail is there.\n\nL to (4,6): possible, if free.\n\n(4,6): not occupied, not wall, so yes.\n\nR to (6,6): body, collision, no.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\nNow, if I move D to (5,5), head to (5,5), which is currently tail. After move, tail moves away.\n\nPositions before move: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), tail (5,5).\n\nMove head to (5,5). Since no food, tail moves: head to (5,5), then first body segment (6,6) moves to (5,6)? Previous head position.\n\nHead was at (5,6), moves to (5,5). Body segment at (6,6) moves to previous head position (5,6). Body segment at (6,5) moves to where it was? Moves to (6,6). Tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5).\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5).\n\nBut (5,5) was tail, now head is there, and body segments.\n\nNo collision because tail moved.\n\nBut now I'm at (5,5) with body at (5,6) above and (6,6) etc.\n\nBut I have food to eat.\n\nThis seems messy. Let's see the other choice at turn 7.\n\nBack to after turn 6, if I moved to (6,5), then at turn 7 I could move D to (6,4) instead of U.\n\nAt turn 6: move R to (6,5), positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (6,4), which has food. So eat food at (6,4).\n\nHead moves to (6,4), and since food, new segment: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5) stays? Positions: previous head (6,5) moves to? After eating: head at (6,4), then body: previous head (6,5) becomes first body, then (5,5) second body, and tail (4,5) remains, so snake: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 4.\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision. D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\n(6,3) is within bounds, y=3>0, not wall. (5,4) free.\n\nSo can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf move D to (6,3), or L to (5,4).\n\nBut no food nearby except (3,2) which is far.\n\n(6,6) is still there, but at (6,6), which is above.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), then I can go up to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nThe point is, if I go to (6,5) at turn 6, I'm forced to eat one of the foods at turn 7, and then I might be in a corner.\n\nIn the first case, when I ate (6,6), I ended up at (5,6) with limited moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (6,4), I'm at (6,4) with only down or left.\n\nBut I can go left to (5,4) or down to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can navigate to other food.\n\nBut there's also (3,2) to consider.\n\nNow, another option at turn 6: instead of moving R, I could move U to (5,6).\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6). Positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5). (4,5) moves to where? Previous body (4,5) moves to (5,5)? Positions: head to (5,6), body segment at (5,5) (previous head), tail at (4,5) moves to where the first body was? Previous: head was (5,5), moved to (5,6). Body was at (4,5), so it moves to previous head position (5,5). Tail was at (3,5), moves to (4,5). So snake: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move to (6,6) to eat food, or L to (4,6), or D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, but it's the segment behind, so moving D to (5,5) would be into body, collision, because (5,5) is occupied.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nSo (5,5) is directly below, occupied by body, so moving D to (5,5) is collision.\n\nMove U to (5,7) wall, impossible.\n\nMove L to (4,6): possible.\n\nMove R to (6,6): possible, and (6,6) has food.\n\nSo I can move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\nOr move L to (4,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), eat food, then positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5)? After eating: head at (6,6), body: previous head (5,6) becomes body, then (5,5) body, and tail (4,5) remains, so [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].\n\nNow, from (6,6), as before, only possible move is L to (5,6), but (5,6) is body, so cannot, collision.\n\nPositions: head at (6,6), body at (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\n(5,6) is body, so moving L to (5,6) is into body, collision.\n\nMoving U to (6,7) wall.\n\nD to (6,5), which might be free? (6,5) not occupied, no wall.\n\nCan move D to (6,5).\n\nOr R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,5).\n\nThen move to (6,5), no food, so tail moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? Previous head (6,6) moves to? Head was at (6,6), moves to (6,5). Body segment at (5,6) moves to previous head position (6,6). Body segment at (5,5) moves to (5,6). Tail at (4,5) moves to (5,5).\n\nSo new: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to (6,4) to eat, or other directions.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move D to (5,4), similar situation.\n\nSo in all cases, if I go directly to eat (6,6) or (6,4), I might end up with limited mobility.\n\nBut I have to eat them eventually, and their life span is short.\n\n(6,6) disappears at turn 10, (6,4) at turn 11.\n\nTurn now is 6, so I have a few turns.\n\nBut I should eat them soon to not lose them.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go for (6,4) first because it has longer life span? No, (6,4) life span 5, (6,6) life span 4, so (6,6) will disappear sooner.\n\n(6,6) life span 4 at turn 6, so it will be gone by turn 10, meaning it exists on turns 6,7,8,9, gone at 10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) exists turns 6,7,8,9,10, gone at 11.\n\n(3,2) exists longer.\n\nSince (6,6) has shorter life, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to be careful not to get stuck.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,5), which is far, so no immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that I don't go to (6,5) first.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, move U to (5,6).\n\nThen at turn 7, move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut as before, then I'm at (6,6) with only down move possible.\n\nThen move D to (6,5), then from (6,5) I can move D to (6,4) to eat the other food.\n\nLet's simulate that sequence.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6). Positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5). (Tail (4,5), from (3,5) moved to (4,5))\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) and eat food. Positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5). Length 4.\n\nTurn 8: from (6,6), only possible move D to (6,5) (since U wall, L body, R wall). Move D to (6,5), no food there. Positions: head to (6,5), body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? Head was (6,6) to (6,5), body at (5,6) moves to (6,6), body at (5,5) moves to (5,6), tail at (4,5) moves to (5,5). So snake: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat food at (6,4). (6,4) has food, so move D to (6,4), eat. Head to (6,4), body: previous head (6,5) becomes body, then (6,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5) stays? After eating: head at (6,4), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and new segment, so tail at (5,5) remains. Positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5). Length 5.\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision. D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R wall.\n\nSo move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSay I move L to (5,4), for example.\n\nBut now I have eaten both close foods, and I can go for (3,2) later.\n\nBut the problem is that after eating (6,6) at turn 7, I had to move down to (6,5) at turn 8, which is fine, then eat (6,4) at turn 9.\n\nLife span: (6,6) eaten at turn 7, before it disappears at turn 10.\n\n(6,4) eaten at turn 9, before turn 11.\n\nGood.\n\nBut at turn 9, after eating (6,4), I'm at (6,4) with body above, so I have to move down or left.\n\nBut I can move to (5,4) or (6,3), then head to the left area for (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is near the internal obstacle (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nBut I have time, life span 8 at turn 6, so until turn 14.\n\nNow, what if at turn 6 I move directly to eat one food.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it worked.\n\nI could eat (6,4) first similarly.\n\nBut (6,6) has shorter life, so better to eat it first.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 6, move D to (5,4), then to (6,4) to eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the potential corner.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (3,2) first, but it's farther, and I might lose the close foods with short life.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), head at (5,5), so Manhattan distance |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5, so at least 5 moves away, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nLife span 8, so I have time, but (6,6) disappears in 4 turns, so if I go for (3,2), I might not reach (6,6) in time.\n\nFor example, if I move left or down at turn 6, I can start heading towards (3,2), but it might take 5 or 6 turns, and (6,6) will be gone by turn 10.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 10 is 4 turns: turns 7,8,9,10, but at turn 10 it disappears, so I need to eat by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) by turn 10.\n\nIf I go for (3,2) now, at turn 6, say move L to (4,5), but I cannot move L because head direction is R, reverse not allowed, so only U, D, R.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nSo at turn 6, only U, D, R possible.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I can eat one food next turn.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), I can eat (6,6) next turn.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), I can eat (6,4) next turn.\n\nSo I have to commit to one.\n\nSince (6,6) has shorter life, I should eat it first.\n\nIn the sequence I had, by moving U at turn 6 to (5,6), then R to (6,6) at turn 7, then D to (6,5) at turn 8, then D to (6,4) at turn 9 to eat, that seems feasible.\n\nAt turn 8, after moving to (6,5), I have the option to not eat (6,4) immediately, but I should, since it's there and life span short.\n\nBut in that case, I eat both by turn 9.\n\nThen I can go for (3,2).\n\nNow, after that, at turn 9, after eating (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is free, no food.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4), etc., towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nAlso, there's the internal obstacle at (3,6), but since y=6 is high, and (3,2) is low, I can go to x=3, y from 5 down to 2, but tail is at (5,5), and body around.\n\nBut I need to plan the path to (3,2).\n\nFirst, let's confirm the sequence for the first few turns.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (6,6) eat food\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (6,4) eat food\n\nNow, at turn 9, after eating (6,4), positions as above.\n\nNow, for turn 10, I need to move from (6,4).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5) body, collision; D to (6,3); L to (5,4); R wall.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), then positions: head to (5,4), no food, so tail moves. Previous tail was at (5,5), but let's list positions before move.\n\nAt turn 9, after eating (6,4): snake positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (5,4), no food there, so head to (5,4), then body segments move: first body (6,5) moves to where head was (6,4)? Body segments: the segment after head is at (6,5), so it moves to previous head position (6,4). Then next segment at (6,6) moves to (6,5). Then segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6). Tail at (5,5) moves to (5,6).\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can move to (4,4), (5,3), (5,5) but (5,5) is not occupied now? Positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is free? (5,5) not in positions, so free.\n\n(5,5) is empty.\n\nSo moves from (5,4): U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nI can go towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,4) at turn 10.\n\nThen continue to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, then to (3,3), (3,2), but there's obstacle at (3,6), but (3,4) should be free.\n\nInternal obstacle is only (3,6), so (3,4) is ok.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to collide.\n\nSince I have time, I can plan.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for a sequence, but the format is to output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer format is: for turn t1, action; turn t1+1, action; etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably a few turns, but since I need to think ahead, I should output a sequence that makes sense.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nIn this case, from turn 6 to turn 10 or 11.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: in the sequence, when I ate (6,6) at turn 7, and moved down, then to (6,4) at turn 9, that was fine.\n\nBut at turn 8, when I was at (6,5), I could have chosen not to go down immediately, but I had to, because no other move, but in that position, from (6,5), I could only go down to (6,4) or up to (6,6), but (6,6) was eaten, so only down.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 8, I moved to (6,5), which is empty, then to (6,4).\n\nBut what if at turn 6 I move differently.\n\nSuppose at turn 6, I move D to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7, I can move R to (6,4) to eat food. Or U to (5,5) body, collision if move U? Current positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5), so (5,5) is above, so move U to (5,5) is into body, collision.\n\nMove D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n\nSo I can move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nAfter eating, at (6,4), with body at (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5)? After eating: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nThen from (6,4), move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision, so only D to (6,3).\n\nThen I can go up to (6,4) but not, etc.\n\nBut to get to (6,6), I need to go up, but from (6,4), I can only go down at first, then I might not reach (6,6) in time.\n\nFor example, at turn 7 eat (6,4), then turn 8 move D to (6,3), then turn 9 move L to (5,3) or something, then I need to go to (5,6) to reach (6,6), but (6,6) disappears at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am at (6,3), move to (5,3), then turn 10 move to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), then to (6,6), but at turn 10, (6,6) disappears, so I need to be on (6,6) at turn 9 or earlier to eat.\n\nTurn 9: if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,4), but (6,4) is empty now, then to (6,5), then to (6,6) at turn 10, but turn 10 is when it disappears, so can I eat at turn 10?\n\nLife span: at turn 6, life span 4, so after turn 6, it decreases each turn.\n\nAfter turn 6: life span 3\n\nAfter turn 7: 2\n\nAfter turn 8: 1\n\nAfter turn 9: 0, so at turn 10 it is gone, cannot eat at turn 10.\n\nTo eat, must be on or before turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,4) at turn 9, but not to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,3), at turn 9, I can only move to adjacent, so (6,4), (6,2), (5,3), (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,4) is free, but not (6,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,6) by turn 9 if I ate (6,4) first.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (6,6) first since it has shorter life.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (6,4) first, I might miss (6,6).\n\nTherefore, the sequence I had: turn 6 move U to (5,6), then turn 7 move R to (6,6) eat, turn 8 move D to (6,5), turn 9 move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen for turn 10, from (6,4) after eating, positions head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5) as before.\n\nThen move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nI need to go towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so moving left and down is good.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,4) at turn 10.\n\nThen from (5,4), as before, I can go to (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nBut let's output the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 6: U\n\nThen turn 7: R (to eat (6,6))\n\nThen turn 8: D (to (6,5))\n\nThen turn 9: D (to (6,4) to eat)\n\nNow for turn 10, I need to choose.\n\nAfter turn 9, positions: head at (6,4), body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail at (5,5)\n\nMove to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is closer to (3,2), since (3,2) is left and down.\n\n(5,4) to (3,2) is |5-3| + |4-2| = 2+2=4 moves.\n\n(6,4) to (3,2) is 3+2=5 moves, so (5,4) is better.\n\nMove L to (5,4) at turn 10.\n\nThen turn 11, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4), D to (5,3), or U to (5,5) if free.\n\n(5,5) should be free now.\n\nThen to (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail and collisions.\n\nSince the food at (3,2) has life span 8 at turn 6, so at turn 10, life span left: at turn 6:8, turn7:7, turn8:6, turn9:5, turn10:4, so still 4 turns, plenty.\n\nBut for the answer, I should output up to turn 10 or so.\n\nThe current turn is t1=6, I need to output from turn 6 onwards.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions: for turns 6 to 10.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, when I move D at turn 9 to (6,4), I eat, so I grow.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but no food at tail.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if I move R at turn 6.\n\nIf turn 6 move R to (6,5), then at turn 7, I must move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nIf move U to (6,6) eat, then positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,6), only move L to (5,6) possible? Earlier we saw only down to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, or L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free? Positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,6) is free, yes.\n\nMove L to (5,6).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,6), no food, so body moves: head (6,6) to (5,6), body at (6,5) moves to (6,6), body at (5,5) moves to (6,5), tail at (4,5) moves to (5,5). So snake: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move to (4,6) or D to (5,5) but (5,5) is tail, can move, or U wall.\n\nIf move D to (5,5), then eat? But (5,5) has no food, but I move to tail position.\n\nAfter move, tail moves away.\n\nBut I need to go to (6,4) to eat.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I move D to (5,5), head to (5,5), which is occupied by tail, but allowed.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,5), body: (5,6) moves to (5,6)? Head was (5,6) to (5,5), body at (6,6) moves to (5,6), body at (6,5) moves to (6,6), tail at (5,5) moves to (6,5). But head is moving to (5,5), which is current tail, so after move, head at (5,5), body at (5,6), (6,6), tail at (6,5).\n\nNow, from here, to go to (6,4), I need to move from (5,5) to (5,4) or (6,5), but (6,5) is tail, can move.\n\nMove to (6,5) at turn 9? Turn 8: after moving to (5,5), then turn 9 move to (6,5), but (6,5) is now tail, move there.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to (6,4) to eat at turn 9.\n\nBut it takes more turns and I might not eat both efficiently.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate both by turn 9 with fewer moves.\n\nSo the U then R sequence is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nNow for turn 10, from (6,4) after eating, move L to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 11, from (5,4), move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc., but for output, since the instruction is to output for the turns, and think ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut the answer format might expect multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", perhaps output 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn 6, so turns 6 to 10.\n\nTurn 10 action.\n\nIn turn 10, I move L to (5,4)\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nBut at turn 9, after moving D to (6,4) and eating, the direction is D, so for turn 10, I move L, which is not reverse, reverse of D is U, so L is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm the life spans.\n\nAt turn 6, food (6,6) life span 4, eaten at turn 7, ok.\n\n(6,4) life span 5, eaten at turn 9, before turn 11, ok.\n\n(3,2) still there for later.\n\nAnd I avoided risks; in the sequence, I didn't hit walls or body.\n\nSo this should be good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the positive food at (6,6) first due to its shorter remaining life span (4 turns, disappearing at turn 10). This food is closer and must be consumed before it expires. After eating (6,6), the snake proceeds to eat the food at (6,4) (life span 5, disappearing at turn 11) as it is adjacent and can be reached efficiently. The food at (3,2) has a longer life span (8 turns, disappearing at turn 14) and can be targeted later after securing the immediate rewards.\n\nThe sequence is planned over 5 turns (turns 6 to 10) to align with the \"think 5+ turns ahead\" requirement, ensuring the snake avoids collisions and walls while consuming both nearby foods:\n- **Turn 6**: Move Up (U) to (5,6) to position for eating (6,6) next turn. This avoids moving directly to (6,5), which would force an immediate choice between (6,6) and (6,4) and could lead to reduced mobility.\n- **Turn 7**: Move Right (R) to (6,6) to eat the positive food. The snake grows to length 4, and the food is consumed before it expires.\n- **Turn 8**: Move Down (D) to (6,5) to reposition for accessing (6,4). This is the only safe move from (6,6) after eating, as moving Up is blocked by the wall (y=7) and moving Left or Right would cause collisions.\n- **Turn 9**: Move Down (D) to (6,4) to eat the positive food. The snake grows to length 5, and the food is consumed before it expires.\n- **Turn 10**: Move Left (L) to (5,4) to begin navigating toward the remaining food at (3,2). This move avoids the body segment at (6,5) and positions the snake for efficient pathing to the left side of the grid.\n\n### Key Risk Mitigations and Long-Term Considerations:\n- **Avoiding Deadly Collisions**: \n  - At turn 7, moving to (6,6) is safe as the cell is free and no body collisions occur.\n  - At turn 8, moving to (6,5) is safe as the tail moves away from (5,5), allowing the head to occupy the cell without collision.\n  - At turn 9, moving to (6,4) is safe with no adjacent body risks.\n  - At turn 10, moving Left from (6,4) to (5,4) is valid (reverse of Down is Up, not Left) and avoids the body at (6,5).\n- **Food Life Span Management**: \n  - (6,6) is eaten at turn 7 (life span 4 at turn 6, so it decreases to 0 after turn 9 and disappears at turn 10; eaten just in time).\n  - (6,4) is eaten at turn 9 (life span 5 at turn 6, decreases to 0 after turn 10 and disappears at turn 11; eaten with margin).\n  - (3,2) will be targeted after turn 10, with 4 turns of life span remaining (at turn 10, life span is 4, disappearing at turn 14). The path via (5,4) allows efficient movement: e.g., continue to (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), then (3,2) by turn 13, well within the life span.\n- **Wall and Obstacle Avoidance**: \n  - The internal obstacle at (3,6) is irrelevant for this sequence but will be avoided when moving toward (3,2) by staying at y < 6.\n  - Border walls (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) are respected; e.g., at turn 7, moving Right to x=6 is safe (x=7 is wall).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: No food is under the tail at (3,5) initially or during this sequence, so this risk is avoided.\n\nThis sequence scores +2 (from two positive foods) by turn 9, increases snake length to 5, and sets up for further scoring with minimal risk. Beyond turn 10, the snake should head toward (3,2) while monitoring for new food spawns and avoiding dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state for turn t1 = 7:\n\n- Walls: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n- Snake positions: Head at (5,6), then (5,5), then (4,5). So the snake has three segments.\n\n- Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,6) from below, since the previous position is (5,5), which is directly below (5,6).\n\n- Food:\n\n  - (6,6) with value 1, life span 3 (so it disappears after 3 more turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 7, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: Disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (6,6) with life span 3 at turn 7:\n\n- Turn 7: life span 3, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 8: life span 2\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1\n\n- Turn 10: life span 0, disappears? Or after turn 9? \"Disappears after N turns\" – N=3, so after 3 turns from now.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf life span is L at turn t, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0. When life span is 0, it disappears, meaning it's not there at the start of turn when life span becomes 0? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret as: at the beginning of turn t, if life span is S, then after this turn, it decreases to S-1. When S=1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So:\n\n- Turn t: food has life span L, present\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, life span becomes 0, food disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, life span 3: present on turns 7,8,9; disappears after turn 9, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, life span 4 at turn 7: present on turns 7,8,9,10; disappears after turn 10.\n\nLife span 7: present until turn 13.\n\nLife span 10: until turn 16.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,6): value 1, life span 3 → available turns 7,8,9; gone after turn 9\n\n- (6,4): value 1, life span 4 → available turns 7,8,9,10; gone after turn 10\n\n- (3,2): value 1, life span 7 → available turns 7 to 13\n\n- (5,1): value 1, life span 10 → available turns 7 to 16\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5), tail at (4,5). Head direction Up.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8 cells. But walls occupy the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles might be present.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6). So cells with walls cannot be moved to.\n\nPlayable cells: all (x,y) where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6, except for internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is within 1-6,1-6.\n\ny=6 is within 1-6? y from 0 to 7, so y=1 to 6 are inside? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free except obstacles.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\nBut (3,6): x=3, y=6, which is a cell, but has an internal obstacle, so wall.\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake: head (5,6), which is x=5,y=6. But (3,6) is blocked, but (5,6) is not blocked? (5,6) should be free, since no wall mentioned except borders and (3,6). Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,6) is x=5,y=6, which is within 1-6,1-6, and not (3,6), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) and (4,5) are free.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction Up. But if direction is Up, that means it came from below, so previous move was to (5,6) from (5,5), which is down to up? Positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] so head at (5,6), previous head was (5,5) at turn 6, I assume. Direction U means it moved Up to (5,6), so from (5,5) to (5,6) is +y, which is Up if y increases up, I think.\n\nConvention: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up.\n\nSo (5,5) to (5,6) is moving up, so head direction is U, correct.\n\nNow possible moves from (5,6):\n\n- Up: (x,y+1) = (5,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot move up.\n\n- Down: (x,y-1) = (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by body, but rule: body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail segment because the tail will move.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nCurrent positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5), tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), that is currently occupied by the body segment. But (5,5) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is (4,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,5) would be collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (5,5) is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,5). So moving to (5,5) would cause collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, left: (x-1,y) = (4,6). What is at (4,6)? Snake positions: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). (4,6) is not occupied, and not wall? Walls: borders and (3,6). (4,6) is x=4,y=6, which is within 1-6,1-6, and not (3,6), so free.\n\nRight: (x+1,y) = (6,6). (6,6) has food, but let's see if it's free. Not occupied by snake, not wall.\n\nDown: (5,5) occupied by body, not tail, so deadly.\n\nUp: (5,7) wall, deadly.\n\nSo possible moves: Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: current direction U, so I cannot move down immediately? Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down, but down is not possible anyway because of body.\n\nSo only left or right.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all food and their positions and life spans.\n\nFood:\n\n1. (6,6): value 1, life span 3 → available turns 7,8,9\n\n2. (6,4): value 1, life span 4 → available turns 7,8,9,10\n\n3. (3,2): value 1, life span 7 → available turns 7 to 13\n\n4. (5,1): value 1, life span 10 → available turns 7 to 16\n\nSnake length: 3 segments.\n\nIf I eat positive food, length increases by 1.\n\nI need to plan moves to eat food without dying.\n\nAlso, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, head at (5,6), tail at (4,5). Are they adjacent?\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,6) and (4,5): not adjacent; (5,6) to (4,5) would be diagonal, not adjacent. So not adjacent.\n\nNow, possible actions at turn 7: L or R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), I eat the food there, since (6,6) has food. Value +1, length becomes 4.\n\nThen snake positions: new head at (6,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, then (5,5), then (4,5) tail. But since I ate food, a new segment is added, so positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5). Length 4.\n\nDirection: I moved right, so head direction becomes R.\n\nThen life span of (6,6) food decreases, but since I ate it, it's gone.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6), no food there, so no eat, snake moves: head to (4,6), then body to (5,6), tail to (5,5), so positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). Tail was (4,5), which moves to (5,5)? Let's see movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nCurrent: positions [A,B,C] = [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nIf move to (4,6): head to (4,6), then segment B (5,5) moves to where head was (5,6)? No.\n\nSnake movement: the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo after move to (4,6): head is (4,6), then the first body segment moves to the previous head position (5,6), and the tail moves to the previous first body position (5,5). So new positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nAnd (4,5) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nNo food eaten, length same.\n\nDirection: moved left, so head direction L.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles: (3,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options at turn 7.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,6) at turn 7.\n\n- Eat food at (6,6), score +1, length 4.\n\n- New positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) — after eating, new segment added where? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail position? Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, but how is the segment added?\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat, the tail grows, so you add a new segment at the tail end after movement.\n\nRule doesn't specify, but it says \"Length of snake +1\", and positions should reflect that.\n\nAfter moving to food, the snake grows, so the new position includes the new segment.\n\nFor example, from positions [A,B,C], move to new head N, with food, so new positions [N, A, B, C], and C is still tail.\n\nIn this case: move to (6,6), eat food, so new snake: head (6,6), then previous positions (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), so [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nNow, at (6,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) — what is there? Currently, in positions, (5,5) is body, but after move, positions are (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) is free? (6,5) not occupied, not wall. Walls: borders and (3,6), so (6,5) is x=6,y=5, free.\n\n- L: (5,6) — but (5,6) is now occupied by body segment. Not tail, tail is (4,5), so moving to (5,6) would be collision.\n\n- R: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move down to (6,5).\n\nNo other choices.\n\nSo at turn 8, must move D to (6,5).\n\nNo food at (6,5), so just move.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5). Tail (4,5) moved away, so positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? Let's see: head to (6,5), then segments: previous head (6,6) becomes body, then (5,6), then (5,5), and since no eat, tail moves from (4,5) to? The last segment was (4,5), but when head moves, the tail moves off.\n\nMovement: head to (6,5), then the first body segment moves to (6,6), which was head position, then second body moves to (5,6), which was first body position, then tail moves to (5,5), which was second body position. So new positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\n(4,5) is free now.\n\nHead direction down, since moved down.\n\nNow at (6,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,6) — occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\n- D: (6,4) — (6,4) has food, and not occupied? Positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) are body, (6,4) free? Yes, and food at (6,4).\n\n- L: (5,5) — (5,5) occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\n- R: (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move down to (6,4).\n\nMove to (6,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nValue +1, length +1 to 5.\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), then previous (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), and add new segment, so tail becomes (5,5)? After eating, grow at tail.\n\nSo positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow at (6,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,5) — occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\n- D: (6,3) — free? y=3, within 1-6, not wall, not occupied? Positions have y=4,5,6; x=5,6. (6,3) free.\n\n- L: (5,4) — free? (5,4) not in positions, not wall.\n\n- R: (7,4) wall, invalid\n\nSo possible moves: down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nNow, no instant reverse: current direction D, so cannot move up, but up is not possible anyway.\n\nSo at turn 10, I can choose D or L.\n\nBut I need to think about future food and survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the other option at turn 7.\n\nOption 2 at turn 7: move L to (4,6)\n\nNo food at (4,6), so no eat.\n\nNew positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow at (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) — (4,5) was tail, but now? Current positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5).\n\n(4,5) is free now? After move, positions are [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)], so (4,5) is free.\n\n(4,5) has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2), (5,1), so (4,5) no food.\n\n- L: (3,6) — but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\n- R: (5,6) — occupied by body, not tail, collision.\n\nSo only possible move down to (4,5).\n\nMust move D to (4,5).\n\nNo food there, so move.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6). Tail (5,5) moved away? Head to (4,5), then body to (4,6), tail to (5,6). So [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nAt (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) — occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\n- D: (4,4) — free? (4,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: (3,5) — free? (3,5) not wall, not occupied.\n\n- R: (5,5) — free? (5,5) not occupied now, not wall.\n\n(5,5) is free since tail moved.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nNo instant reverse issue, direction D, opposite U not possible.\n\nNow, I have choices.\n\nBack to option 1: if I went right at turn 7, by turn 9 I ate two food, at (6,6) and (6,4), length 5, and at turn 10 I'm at (6,4) with options to go down or left.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nIn option 1, after turn 9, positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nAt turn 10, from (6,4), I can go down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go down to (6,3), no food, then positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail (5,5) moves away.\n\nThen at (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4) body collision, D to (6,2) free, L to (5,3) free, R wall. So must go D or L.\n\nBut I need to get to other food like (3,2) or (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at bottom, (3,2) left.\n\nBut the snake is at (6,3) to (5,6), so it's on the right side.\n\nIf I go left to (5,4) at turn 10, from (6,4) to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail (5,6) moves to? After move, head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,6) is body, but tail was (5,6)? Previous positions before move: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nHead to (5,4), then body: (6,4) to (6,4)? Head was (6,4), so first body to (6,4), but (6,4) is the new head position? No.\n\nMovement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo from [H,B1,B2,B3,T] = [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nMove to (5,4): new head (5,4)\n\nThen B1 moves to H position (6,4)\n\nB2 moves to B1 position (6,5)\n\nB3 moves to B2 position (6,6)\n\nT moves to B3 position (5,6)\n\nSo new positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nTail is (5,6), which was B3.\n\nNow at (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,5) — but (5,5) is not occupied, it was T and moved away. In new positions, (5,5) is free? Positions are (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is free, no food.\n\n- D: (5,3) free\n\n- L: (4,4) free\n\n- R: (6,4) occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\nSo can go U, D, or L.\n\nBut U to (5,5) no food, etc.\n\nNow, let's think about long-term. There is food at (3,2) and (5,1).\n\n(3,2) is left-bottom, (5,1) bottom.\n\nBut in option 1, I'm on the right, and to get to left, I need to go left, but the snake is long, might block itself.\n\nAlso, life span: (3,2) life span 7, available until turn 13, (5,1) until turn 16.\n\nTurn 10 is when I have choice.\n\nBut let's see the other path from turn 7.\n\nIn option 2, at turn 7 I moved left to (4,6), then down to (4,5) at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 9, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, (3,5) is free, (4,4) free, (5,5) free.\n\nFood: (6,6) is available until turn 9, so at turn 9, if I can reach it.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), I'm at (4,5), which is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go right to (5,5), no food.\n\nThen at (5,5), I can go to (5,4), (5,6), (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) is body? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 9, after move to (4,5), positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), move to, say, (5,5) for example.\n\nMove to (5,5), no food, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6). So [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nThen at (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) — (5,6) is occupied by tail? Positions: (4,6) is tail, (5,6) is not occupied; (5,6) was body but moved? Current positions before move: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 8: positions [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]  // head (4,5), body (4,6), tail (5,6)\n\nAt turn 9, move from head (4,5) to new position.\n\nIf move to (5,5): new head (5,5), then body to previous head (4,5), tail to previous body (4,6). So new positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\n(5,6) is free now.\n\nAt (5,5), moves:\n\n- U: (5,6) — free, no food\n\n- D: (5,4) — free\n\n- L: (4,5) — occupied by body, not tail, collision\n\n- R: (6,5) — free\n\nSo can go U, D, or R.\n\n(6,6) has food, life span 3, available turn 9 last time.\n\nIf I go U to (5,6), no food, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go to (6,6) which has food.\n\nMove to (6,6), eat, length +1 to 4.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen as before, only down to (6,5), then to (6,4) eat, etc.\n\nBut at turn 9, I can eat (6,6) if I go that way.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat at turn 7, so at turn 9 I can eat (6,6) if I move accordingly.\n\nBut let's compare scores.\n\nIn option 1, I ate at turn 7 and turn 9 (since at turn 8 I moved to (6,5) no food, turn 9 to (6,4) eat).\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) eat\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nSo ate at turn 7 and 9.\n\nThen at turn 10 at (6,4), can move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nNow in option 2, if I move to (6,6) at turn 9 or 10.\n\nFrom turn 7: move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5) for example.\n\nThen positions [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nThen at turn 10, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), no food.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11, move to (6,6) eat, since (6,6) available turn 9? Life span: at turn 7, life span 3, so available turn 7,8,9. Turn 9 is last, turn 10 it disappears.\n\nLife span at turn 7: 3, so after turn 7, life span 2; after turn 8, life span 1; after turn 9, life span 0, disappears. So available on turn 7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 10, it's gone.\n\nSo to eat (6,6), I must be on (6,6) on turn 7,8, or 9.\n\nIn option 2, at turn 9, I can be at (5,5) or (4,4), etc., not at (6,6).\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 9, if I move directly to (6,6)? Not possible, not adjacent.\n\nShortest path: from (4,5) to (6,6) is two moves: e.g., to (5,5) then to (6,6), but at turn 9 I can only move to one cell, say to (5,5), then at turn 10 to (6,6), but turn 10 (6,6) food is gone, since disappeared after turn 9.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,6) in option 2; only in option 1 I can eat it at turn 7 or 9, but in option 1 I ate at turn 7.\n\nIn option 2, I miss (6,6) food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is available until turn 10.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 7: available turn 7,8,9,10; disappears after turn 10.\n\nSo can be eaten on those turns.\n\nIn option 2, at turn 10, I might be able to eat it.\n\nBut let's see where I am.\n\nFirst, prioritize long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (3,2) and (5,1), which have longer life span.\n\n(3,2) life span 7, available until turn 13; (5,1) until turn 16.\n\nIn option 1, I have a longer snake, which might make it harder to maneuver, especially to reach (3,2) which is on the left.\n\nGrid is small, 6x6 playable, with obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,6) wall.\n\nSo 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus one wall, 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 5 in option 1 by turn 10, which is significant.\n\nIn option 2, length 3 at turn 9.\n\nBut in option 2, if I don't eat (6,6), I can go for other food.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) at turn 9, I can move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is near the obstacle.\n\nLet's list all cells to avoid confusion.\n\nI should plan a path to eat all food if possible, but with survival.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrently not applicable.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate choice at turn 7.\n\nIf I move right, I eat (6,6) and then (6,4) quickly, but then I'm stuck on the right with a long snake, and need to go left to get (3,2) and (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 10, if I go left to (5,4), then to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) to eat (5,1), but (5,1) is at bottom, and I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nPositions at turn 10 in option 1: if I go to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] as before.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), left to (4,4), or up to (5,5) which is free.\n\nIf I go down to (5,3), no food, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6) moves to? Head to (5,3), body to (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), and tail to (5,6)? Previous tail (5,6) moves to the position of B3, which is (6,6), so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nThen from (5,3), to (5,2), then to (5,1) to eat at turn 12 or something.\n\n(5,1) food, life span 10, available.\n\nBut at (5,1), I eat, length +1.\n\nThen I need to go to (3,2), but (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, I'm at x=5,y=1, so need to go left.\n\nBut snake is long, might block.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,1), positions head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), etc., so the body is on the bottom row, might block going up.\n\nBut I can go left from (5,1) to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2) but (3,2) is food, so eat.\n\nBut (3,1) to (3,2) is up.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, from (5,3) to (5,2) at turn, say, 11, no food.\n\nThen to (5,1) at turn 12, eat.\n\nPositions: before move, at turn 11, head at (5,3), positions [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nMove to (5,2): new head (5,2), body to (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), tail to (6,6) so [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\n(6,6) free.\n\nThen turn 12, move to (5,1): eat, grow, positions head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and add new segment, so tail (6,5) or? Grow at tail, so positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nLength 6.\n\nThen from (5,1), can go left to (4,1) or up to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision, so only left to (4,1).\n\nNo food at (4,1), move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5) moves to (6,4)? Head to (4,1), body to (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail to (6,5) position, but (6,5) was tail, moves to previous B position (6,4), so positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nThen from (4,1), can go left to (3,1) or up to (4,2), or down invalid y=0 wall, right to (5,1) body collision.\n\nSo go left to (3,1) or up to (4,2).\n\n(3,2) food is at (3,2), so from (4,1), go up to (4,2), then to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,1), to (3,1) then to (3,2), or to (4,2) then left to (3,2).\n\nSay go to (3,1) first, no food, then to (3,2) eat.\n\nBut at (3,2), when I eat, need to check if head adjacent to tail.\n\nTail is at (6,4) or something, not adjacent.\n\nThen it should be ok.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has limited space, with the obstacle at (3,6), which might block paths.\n\nFor example, to go from bottom to top, but y from 1 to 6.\n\nIn this path, I can eat (5,1) and (3,2), but it might be tight.\n\nIn option 2, I have shorter snake, might be easier to move.\n\nBut in option 2, I missed (6,6) food, so score lower.\n\n(6,6) value 1, so if I eat it, +1, else not.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) I can eat later.\n\nIn option 2 at turn 7: move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (4,5)\n\nNow at turn 9, from (4,5), I can move to (4,4), (3,5), or (5,5).\n\nFood (6,4) available until turn 10.\n\n(3,2) available long time.\n\n(5,1) available.\n\nAlso, (6,6) gone after turn 9.\n\nSo at turn 9, from (4,5), if I move to (5,5), then at turn 10 to (5,4) or (6,5) or (5,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (5,5), I can go to (6,5) then to (6,4) at turn 10 or 11.\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,5), no food, positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 10: from (5,5), move to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move to (6,4), eat, length +1 to 4.\n\nPositions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,4), same as before, can go down or left.\n\nBut I ate (6,4) at turn 11, later than in option 1.\n\nIn option 1, I ate at turn 9.\n\nAlso, in option 2, I didn't eat (6,6), so total food eaten less.\n\nBut I can go for (3,2) earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 9 from (4,5), move down to (4,4), no food.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (4,5), tail (4,6) or? After move to (4,4): from [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] to [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nThen turn 10, from (4,4), can move down to (4,3), left to (3,4), right to (5,4), up to (4,5) body collision.\n\nSo go to (4,3), (3,4), or (5,4).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so go down or left.\n\nSay go to (4,3), no food.\n\nThen to (4,2), no food.\n\nThen to (3,2) eat at turn 12 or something.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) can be eaten later.\n\nBut with shorter snake, easier.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating more food is better.\n\nIn option 1, I eat two food by turn 9, length 5.\n\nIn option 2, if I eat (6,4) at turn 11, and (3,2) later, I might eat three food, but later.\n\nBut all food value 1, so number matters.\n\nThere are four food, I can eat all if possible.\n\nBut with long snake, hard to move around.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks the top row.\n\ny=6 has (3,6) wall, so at y=6, x=3 is wall, so snake cannot pass there.\n\nFor example, from left to right at top, must go around.\n\nNow, back to turn 7 decision.\n\nAnother thing: at (6,6), when I move right, I eat, but then I must go down immediately, no choice.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nBut in the short term, moving right gives me +1 now, and another +1 soon.\n\nMoving left might allow me to go for (3,2) earlier.\n\nLet's see distance.\n\nFrom current head (5,6) to (3,2): dx=2, dy=4, so Manhattan distance 6, with snake length 3, I can reach in 6 turns, but need to avoid walls.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,1): dx=0, dy=5, distance 5.\n\n(6,6) is adjacent, so I can eat now.\n\n(6,4) is close.\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly (5,1) life span 10.\n\nSo perhaps eating the closer food first is better, as long as I don't trap myself.\n\nIn option 1, after eating (6,6) and (6,4), I'm at (6,4) with snake along the right and top, and I can go down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), etc., to reach (5,1) as I thought.\n\nThen to (3,2).\n\nBut let's check if I can reach (3,2) without dying.\n\nFor example, from (5,1) after eating, I'm at (5,1), can go left to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2).\n\nAt (3,2), eat, grow.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or right, but tail is behind.\n\nBut the grid has (3,6) wall, so at y=6, I cannot go to x=3.\n\nBut I can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), go up to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut with length 7 or so, it might be crowded.\n\nSnake length after eating (5,1) and (3,2): start from 3, eat two in option 1 by turn 9, length 5, then eat (5,1) say turn 12, length 6, then (3,2) turn 13 or 14, length 7.\n\nGrid has 35 cells, 7 is 20%, possible, but need to be careful.\n\nIn option 2, start length 3, eat (6,4) at turn 11, length 4, then (5,1) and (3,2), length 6.\n\nBut missed (6,6), so only three food.\n\nIn option 1, I can eat four food.\n\nBut in option 1, I need to ensure I can reach (3,2) in time.\n\nLife span of (3,2) is 7 at turn 7, so available until turn 13.\n\nAt turn 10 in option 1, I'm at (6,4) or (5,4), then to (5,1) by turn 12, then to (3,2) by turn 14? Turn 14 is after turn 13, so (3,2) disappears after turn 13, so must eat by turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is the last turn it is available.\n\nAt turn 10, positions at (6,4) or (5,4), say at (5,4).\n\nTurn 10: at (5,4), move to (5,3) or (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nTo go to (5,1), best to go down.\n\nTurn 10: move to (5,3), no food\n\nTurn 11: move to (5,2), no food\n\nTurn 12: move to (5,1), eat, length 6 (since from 5, +1)\n\nThen from (5,1), turn 12, can only move left to (4,1) because up to (5,2) body collision.\n\nMove to (4,1), no food\n\nTurn 13: from (4,1), can move left to (3,1) or up to (4,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so to eat it at turn 13, I need to be on (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 13, I can move to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), not (3,2), so not eating.\n\nIf I move to (4,2), not (3,2).\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,2) on turn 13 from there.\n\nI need to be at (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nBut at turn 12, I'm at (5,1) eating, or just moved to (4,1).\n\nAt turn 12, after eating (5,1), head at (5,1), positions as before.\n\nThen at turn 13, I can move to (4,1), but not to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is not adjacent to (5,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), (3,2) is up-left, not adjacent, must move to (3,1) or (4,2) first.\n\nSo at best, at turn 13 I can be at (3,1) or (4,2), not at (3,2), so I miss eating (3,2) because it disappears after turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is the last turn it is available, so I need to be on (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nBut from turn 12 position, I cannot reach (3,2) in one move.\n\nAt turn 12, before move, head at (5,1) if I ate, or if I didn't eat yet.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 12: move to (5,1) and eat, so at the start of turn 12, head is at (5,2) or something.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 10: head at (5,4) for example, move to (5,3)\n\nPositions: assume from turn 10 at (5,4), move to (5,3), no eat, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] or whatever, but not important.\n\nTurn 11: from (5,3) move to (5,2), no eat\n\nTurn 12: move to (5,1), eat, so at turn 12, after move, head at (5,1), positions include new segment.\n\nAt the beginning of turn 12, head is at (5,2) if I moved there at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11: after move to (5,2), head at (5,2)\n\nThen at turn 12, move to (5,1), eat.\n\nSo on turn 12, I am at (5,1) eating.\n\nFor (3,2), I need to be there on turn 13.\n\nBut (5,1) to (3,2) is not adjacent, distance 2, so I cannot be at (3,2) on turn 13; at best, turn 14, but turn 14 (3,2) is gone.\n\nTherefore, in this path, I cannot eat (3,2) because I don't have time to reach it from the right side after eating (5,1).\n\n(3,2) life span 7 at turn 7, available turn 7 to 13, so turn 13 last chance.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at (5,1) or moving from it, not at (3,2).\n\nSo I miss (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, in option 2, if I go for (3,2) first, I can eat it.\n\nFor example, in option 2, at turn 7 move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8 move D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9 from (4,5) move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5)\n\nSay move to (3,5) at turn 9.\n\n(3,5) is free? x=3,y=5, not wall, not occupied.\n\nMove to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  // since previous [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] to [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nThen at (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) but (3,6) wall, invalid; D to (3,4) free; L to (2,5) x=2, but x=1 to 6, x=2 is within, not border; border x=0 and x=7, so x=2 ok; R to (4,5) body collision.\n\nSo can go D or L.\n\n(3,2) is below, so go down.\n\nTurn 10: move to (3,4), no food\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move to (3,3), no food\n\nTurn 12: move to (3,2), eat, length +1 to 4.\n\nAvailable on turn 12.\n\nThen I can go for other food.\n\n(6,4) available until turn 10, but turn 10 I'm at (3,4), not close, so I miss (6,4).\n\n(5,1) available until turn 16, so I can go there.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) after eating, head at (3,2), positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) or something.\n\nAfter eat at (3,2), positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]? Let's see: before move, at turn 12, head at (3,3) or what.\n\nTurn 11: head at (3,3), positions [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]  // after turn 11 move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 12: move to (3,2), eat, so new positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] with new segment.\n\nThen from (3,2), can go down to (3,1) or right to (4,2), etc., to reach (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is missed, but (6,6) also missed.\n\nSo in this case, I eat only two food: (3,2) and possibly (5,1), but missed (6,6) and (6,4).\n\n(6,4) available until turn 10, I'm not there.\n\nSo only two food eaten.\n\nWhereas in option 1, I eat (6,6) and (6,4), and (5,1), but miss (3,2), so three food.\n\nBetter to eat three than two.\n\nCan I eat all four?\n\nTo eat all, I need to get to (3,2) by turn 13.\n\nIn option 1, if I don't go down to (5,1) first, but go left earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 10 from (6,4), instead of going down or to (5,4), but from (6,4) I can go left to (5,4).\n\nThen at turn 10, at (5,4), I can go left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I go left to (4,4) at turn 10.\n\nPositions: from (6,4) to (5,4), turn 10.\n\nAssume at turn 9, after eating (6,4), head at (6,4), positions [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 10: move to (5,4), no food, positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] as before.\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,4), move to (4,4), no food\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6) moves to (6,6)? Head to (4,4), body to (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail to (5,6) position, but (5,6) was tail, moves to previous B position (6,6), so positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,4), move to (4,3) or (3,4) or (4,5) etc.\n\nTo reach (3,2), need to go down and left.\n\nSay move to (4,3), no food\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), move to (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3)\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,3), I can move to (3,3) or (4,2), but not directly to (3,2).\n\nAt turn 13, if I move to (3,3), not (3,2), so not eating.\n\nOr to (4,2), not (3,2).\n\nSo still cannot eat (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nIf at turn 12 from (4,4), I move to (3,4), then turn 13 to (3,3) or (3,2) but (3,2) is down.\n\nFrom (3,4), move to (3,3) or (3,2) if possible.\n\n(3,2) is two steps down from (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 13, move to (3,3) or (2,4) or (3,5), not to (3,2).\n\nSo I cannot be at (3,2) on turn 13 from this position.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to reach (3,2) by turn 13 if I start from the right after eating the top-right food.\n\nThe only way to eat (3,2) is to go for it first or early.\n\nIn option 2, if I go for (3,2) directly, I can eat it by turn 12, as I had, but then I miss the right-side food.\n\nBut (6,6) and (6,4) have shorter life span, so if I don't eat them early, I lose them.\n\nIn particular, (6,6) must be eaten by turn 9, which requires me to be on that side at turn 7-9.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at (5,6), which is adjacent to (6,6), so I can eat it now by moving right.\n\nIf I don't, I can't later because of distance and life span.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) can be eaten later, but in the direct path to (3,2), I might not get it.\n\nSo trade-off.\n\nBut in terms of score, if I move right, I get two food for sure, and possibly (5,1), total three.\n\nIf I move left, I can get (3,2) and (5,1), but miss the two on right, so only two.\n\nBetter to move right and get three.\n\nI can try to get (3,2) after, but as we saw, not possible.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (6,4) at turn 9, at turn 10 from (6,4) go down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then down to (5,2), but not towards (3,2), still not close.\n\nOr from (6,4) go left to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc., same issue.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to reach (3,2) in time.\n\nTherefore, the best is to move right at turn 7 to eat (6,6), then proceed to eat (6,4) and (5,1), and forget (3,2).\n\nThen for long-term survival, after eating (5,1), I can explore other areas.\n\nBut the grid has only 35 cells, snake length 6 after three food, so 29 free, but with walls, I can survive by not hitting walls or itself.\n\nBut to maximize score, since no more food, I need to survive as long as possible, but the question is to maximize score by eating food, so after all food eaten, survival is for not dying, but no more score.\n\nSo the score is the number of food eaten.\n\nSo with three food, score 3.\n\nWith two, score 2.\n\nSo better to have three.\n\nIf I can eat (3,2) but miss others, only two.\n\nSo move right at turn 7.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) eat\n\nTurn 8: must move D to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nThen at turn 10, from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSince (5,1) is south-west, better to go left or down.\n\nIf I go down to (6,3), then I can go further down to (6,2), (6,1), but y=1, then to (5,1), but (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so from (6,1) to (5,1) left.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 10, if I move down to (6,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5) moves to (5,6)? Head to (6,3), body to (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail to (5,5) position, but (5,5) was tail, moves to previous B position (5,6), so positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nThen turn 11: from (6,3), move to (6,2) or (5,3) or (6,4) invalid.\n\nSay move to (6,2), no food\n\nTurn 12: move to (6,1), no food? y=1, not wall.\n\nThen turn 13: move to (5,1), eat, since (5,1) food.\n\nAvailable turn 13.\n\nThen score 3.\n\nIf at turn 10 I go left to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc., same thing, eat (5,1) at turn 12 or 13.\n\nBut going down might be simpler.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, I should output a sequence.\n\nBut for now, at turn 7, move R.\n\nThen for future, I can decide based on state.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 9, I have choices, but for the sequence, I can output until I eat or something.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the food life span, I need to go to (5,1).\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 7: move R\n\nTurn 8: move D (only choice)\n\nTurn 9: move D (to eat (6,4))\n\nThen at turn 10, I can choose, say move D to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) eat\n\nBut at turn 13, from (6,1) to (5,1), left.\n\nAnd (5,1) is available.\n\nThen after that, no more food, but I can continue moving to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, perhaps output until turn 13 or so.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence, but it might be long.\n\nSince the thinking is ahead, I can provide the immediate action and perhaps the plan.\n\nBut I think for the boxed answer, I should provide actions for the next few turns, say 5 turns, as per \"think 5+ turns ahead\".\n\nt1=7, so turns 7 to 12, 6 turns.\n\nOr 7 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 10 I have a choice, but in the path to (5,1), going down is fine.\n\nTo avoid the tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nSo let's go with move right at turn 7.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nThen turn 10: D (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 11: D (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 12: D (to (6,1))\n\nThen turn 13: L to (5,1) eat, but that's beyond 5 turns.\n\nFrom turn 7 to 11: 5 turns? t1=7, t1 to t1+4 is 5 turns? Let's see: turn 7,8,9,10,11 — that's 5 actions.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nBut in 5 turns, at turn 11, where am I?\n\nFrom above: turn 7 R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 8 D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9 D to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10 D to (6,3)  // if I choose D\n\nTurn 11 D to (6,2)  // or if at turn 10 I go L, but let's stick with D.\n\nAt turn 11, at (6,2), with positions depending.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output turns 7 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 10, I could go left, but for consistency, go down.\n\nTo reach (5,1) faster, from turn 10 at (6,4), go left to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc., but similar number of moves to (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (5,1): if go directly, (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) or (6,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1), same 4 moves.\n\nSo either way.\n\nI think move right at turn 7 is better.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nThen for turn 10, say D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince at turn 9 I ate (6,4), at turn 10 I can go down or left, both fine, but for the sequence, I'll go down.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11 down.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I have a plan.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 7):**\n- **Snake Position:** Head at (5,6), body segments at (5,5) and (4,5). Snake length is 3.\n- **Head Direction:** Up (U).\n- **Walls:** Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,6), making (3,6) impassable.\n- **Food:**\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 3 (available on turns 7, 8, 9; disappears after turn 9).\n  - (6,4): Value +1, life span 4 (available on turns 7, 8, 9, 10; disappears after turn 10).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 7 (available on turns 7 to 13; disappears after turn 13).\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 10 (available on turns 7 to 16; disappears after turn 16).\n\n**Immediate Moves at Turn 7:**\n- From head position (5,6), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (5,7): y=7 is a border wall, invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (5,5): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision risk. Invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (4,6): Free cell (no wall or snake).\n  - Right (R) to (6,6): Free cell with positive food.\n- No instant reverse: Current direction is U, so down (D) is opposite but already invalid.\n- **Choice:** Move right (R) to eat (6,6) for immediate +1 score and length increase to 4. This exploits the short life span (only available until turn 9) and positions the snake to eat (6,4) next.\n\n**Why Move Right (R) at Turn 7?**\n- Eating (6,6) at turn 7 scores +1 and increases length to 4.\n- After eating, the snake can only move down (D) to (6,5) on turn 8 (no other safe moves), then down (D) to (6,4) on turn 9 to eat another +1 food (life span 4, available until turn 10).\n- This secures two food items quickly (score +2 by turn 9) with minimal risk.\n- Alternative move left (L) to (4,6) misses (6,6) due to life span constraints (cannot reach it by turn 9 from left), resulting in lower score.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead Plan (Turns 7-12):**\n- **Priority:** Maximize score by eating (6,6), (6,4), and (5,1) while avoiding (3,2) due to time/distance constraints. (3,2) is too far to reach by turn 13 from the right side after eating (6,4), and attempting it risks missing (5,1) or causing self-collision with a longer snake.\n- **Risk Avoidance:** \n  - After eating (6,4) at turn 9, the snake is at (6,4) with a length of 5. Moving down repeatedly to (6,1) avoids body collisions and walls, setting up a safe path to (5,1) by turn 13.\n  - (5,1) has a long life span (until turn 16), so it can be eaten after turns 7-12 actions.\n  - Tail reward danger: Not a concern here, as tail is never adjacent to head with food.\n- **Path to (5,1):** From (6,4) at turn 10, move down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then left to (5,1) to eat at turn 13. This path is safe and efficient.\n- **Why Not (3,2)?** Manhattan distance from (5,6) to (3,2) is 6, but with snake growth and grid constraints (obstacle at (3,6)), reaching (3,2) by turn 13 requires deviating early. This sacrifices (6,6) and (6,4), reducing score to 2 (only (3,2) and (5,1)). Eating three food (score +3) is better than two.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After eating (5,1), the snake can navigate open areas (e.g., left to (4,1) or up) to avoid collisions, but no more food exists. Survival ensures the score is retained.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 7-12):**\n- **Turn 7 (t1):** Move R to (6,6) – Eat food, score +1, length 4.\n- **Turn 8:** Move D to (6,5) – No food, safe move (only option).\n- **Turn 9:** Move D to (6,4) – Eat food, score +1 (total +2), length 5.\n- **Turn 10:** Move D to (6,3) – No food, path toward (5,1).\n- **Turn 11:** Move D to (6,2) – No food, continue down.\n- **Turn 12:** Move D to (6,1) – No food, prepare for left to (5,1) on turn 13.\n\n**Post-Turn 12 Plan:** \n- Turn 13: Move L to (5,1) to eat last food (score +3 total). Then, prioritize survival by moving to open cells (e.g., left to (4,1) or up if possible).\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating three food items safely and avoids the unreachable (3,2).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: R (right)  \nTurn 8: D (down)  \nTurn 9: D (down)  \nTurn 10: D (down)  \nTurn 11: D (down)  \nTurn 12: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) and (7,7) are corners, so walls are all around.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,6), then body at (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake is 4 segments long.\n\nHead direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (6,6) from (5,6). So current direction is R.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,4) with value 1, life span 3. Since it's turn 8, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so at turn 11 (8+3=11, but life span decreases each turn including current, so if not eaten, it disappears at the start of turn 11? Let me clarify life span.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t, with life span L, it will be gone after L more turns. So at turn t, life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,4) at turn 8, life span 3, so it will be present on turns 8,9,10, and disappear at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) with value 1, life span 6, so present turns 8 to 13, disappear at turn 14.\n\n(5,1) with value 1, life span 9, present turns 8 to 16, disappear at turn 17.\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). So let's plot this.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, so increasing x right, increasing y up? Direction U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but in coordinates, it might vary. Here, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 should be bottom, y=7 top. Similarly, R is (x+1,y), so x increases right.\n\nSo:\n\n- Head: (6,6)\n\n- Body: (5,6) // directly left of head\n\n- Then (5,5) // down from (5,6)? (5,6) to (5,5) is down, since y decreases.\n\nFrom positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo from head to tail: (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (4,5)\n\nSo the snake is moving: from (5,6) to (6,6) right, then from (5,5) to (5,6) up? Let's see the path.\n\nAt previous turn, snake was probably at [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), ...] but since it moved right to (6,6), the tail was (4,5) or something. Positions given are current: head (6,6), then next segment (5,6), which was previous head, then (5,5), then (4,5).\n\nSo the body segments: (5,6) is connected to head, so when head moves, (5,6) will become body, etc.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so head just moved right to (6,6).\n\nNow possible moves: since head at (6,6), direction R, so can move U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite to R? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next turn. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nList all cells:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also (3,6) internal obstacle.\n\nSo cells: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 are free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 free? y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7 walls.\n\nFor example, (1,1) should be free, (1,0) is wall, etc.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake occupies: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFood at: (6,4), (3,2), (5,1)\n\n(6,4) is below (6,6), since y=4 vs y=6, y decreasing down, so (6,4) is two steps down from (6,6).\n\n(3,2) is left and down.\n\n(5,1) is down and a bit left.\n\nLife spans: (6,4) life 3, so must eat by turn 10 or lose it.\n\n(3,2) life 6, by turn 13.\n\n(5,1) life 9, by turn 16.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so for turns 8 to 13 or so.\n\nNow, head at (6,6), can move U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each option for turn 8.\n\nFirst, move R: to (7,6). But x=7 is wall, so collision, die. Cannot move R.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,6) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSo R is not possible.\n\nMove U: to (6,7). But y=7 is wall, so also collision. Cannot move U.\n\ny=7 is top wall, so (6,7) is wall.\n\nMove D: to (6,5). Is that free?\n\n(6,5): not wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). So (6,5) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: cells occupied by snake are only those listed, so (6,5) is empty.\n\nAlso, no food there, I think. Foods are at (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,5) has no food mentioned, so empty.\n\nSo moving D to (6,5) is possible.\n\nBut current direction is R, and D is down, not opposite, so ok.\n\nOnly possible move is D? U and R are walls, L is reverse, not allowed.\n\nCannot move L because reverse, and U and R are walls, so only D is possible for turn 8.\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent head position (6,6), direction R.\n\nMove options:\n\n- U: (6,7) -> y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) -> possible\n\n- L: (5,6) -> but (5,6) is the body segment, and also L is opposite to R, so cannot move opposite direction.\n\nNo instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so moving L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nR: (7,6) -> x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is D to (6,5).\n\nSo for turn 8, must move D.\n\nBut let's double-check the grid.\n\nx=6, y=6.\n\nU: (6,7) -> y=7 is wall, yes.\n\nD: (6,5) -> y=5, which is between 1 and 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are free? y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, so cells with y=1 to 6 are free for y, similarly x=1 to 6 free.\n\ny=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall. So (6,5) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nNot occupied: snake has (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). (6,5) not there.\n\nNo food at (6,5), so empty.\n\nSo yes, only move is D to (6,5).\n\nSo turn 8 action: D.\n\nAfter moving, snake will be: head moves to (6,5), then body: the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where head was, (6,6), but since head moves, the body follows.\n\nWhen head moves to (6,5), the new positions: head at (6,5), then the first body segment was at (5,6), which will move to the previous head position (6,6)? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move D to (6,5):\n\nNew head: (6,5)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to old head position (6,6)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (5,6)\n\nSegment 3 (tail) moves to old segment 2 position (5,5)\n\nAnd the old tail position (4,5) is now empty.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nTail is at (5,5).\n\nNow, direction: head moved down, so new direction is D.\n\nTurn 8 done.\n\nNow turn 9.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse: current direction D, so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n\nSo possible: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, check each:\n\nMove D: to (6,4). (6,4) has food! Value +1.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\n(6,4) is not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake now is (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5). (6,4) not in, so free except for food.\n\nFood at (6,4) is present, life span 3 at turn 8, so at turn 9, life span will be 2? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 8, food at (6,4) has life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 8, it decreases, so at start of turn 9, life span is 2? Or during the turn?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food, when we say at turn t, life span L, it means after turn t, it has L-1 left? Or before turn t, it has L for the turn.\n\nTypically, at the beginning of turn, the life span is checked.\n\nBut for eating, when head moves to a food cell during a turn, it eats it.\n\nThe countdown decreases after each turn, I think.\n\nLet's see: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L:\n\n- During turn t, it is present, and can be eaten.\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n\n- Similarly, during turn t+1, if life span now L-1, it is present if L-1 > 0.\n\n- Disappears when life span reaches 0.\n\nAt turn 8, (6,4) has life span 3, so present turns 8,9,10.\n\nAt turn 11, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo at turn 9, (6,4) is still present with life span 2 (after decrease).\n\nNow, moving to (6,4) from (6,5) down.\n\nIs it safe? (6,4) is empty, no snake body, not wall.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows.\n\nIf head moves to food, it eats it, and snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added.\n\nSo if head moves to (6,4), eats food, value +1, length increases by 1.\n\nThen new snake positions: head at (6,4), then the body: since ate, tail stays, so segments: (6,4) head, then (6,5) which was head, now body, then (6,6), then (5,6), then (5,5) tail.\n\nCurrent before move: snake at [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nHead moves to (6,4), which has food, so eats it.\n\nThen new head at (6,4), and the body: (6,5) remains as first body segment, (6,6) second, (5,6) third, and (5,5) tail, but since ate, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail remains (5,5), and length increases.\n\nPositions: after eating, head at (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) becomes body, so segments: head (6,4), body1 (6,5), body2 (6,6), body3 (5,6), tail (5,5). Since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so (5,5) is still tail.\n\nSnake grows when eating, so new segment is added at the position where tail was, but tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at food cell, then the existing body segments remain, and tail stays, so length +1.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: [A, B, C, D] where A head, D tail.\n\nAfter move to food cell F: new positions [F, A, B, C, D] so head F, then A, B, C, D all become body, with D still tail? D was tail, now it's the second last, and new tail is D? No.\n\n[F, A, B, C, D] with F head, A first body, B second, C third, D tail. Since ate, D is now tail, and C is body, etc.\n\nIn this case, from [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] move head to (6,4) eat food, so new snake: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] so head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5). Length 5 now.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail is at (5,5), head at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nBut we need to think about future moves.\n\nFirst, back to turn 9 options.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D.\n\nCan move: D, L, R (not U).\n\nMove D: to (6,4) with food, as above.\n\nMove L: to (5,5). But (5,5) is currently occupied by the tail. Is that a collision?\n\nCollision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nImportant: moving to tail is allowed if it's the tail, because when head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, (5,5) is the tail. If head moves to (5,5), and it's the tail, then since tail moves, it should be ok, as long as after move, head and body don't collide.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to the tail cell, and tail is moving, it doesn't cause collision because tail vacates the cell.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nBut (5,5) has no food, so just moving there.\n\nMove R: to (7,5). But x=7 wall, invalid. Cannot.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (6,4) with food, or L to (5,5) tail.\n\nNow, moving to (5,5) is safe because it's the tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,5): head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, so when head moves there, the tail was at (5,5), but tail will move to the previous position of segment before it.\n\nCurrent positions: head (6,5), body1 (6,6), body2 (5,6), tail (5,5)\n\nIf head moves to (5,5), which is the current tail position.\n\nSince no food, snake doesn't grow, so tail moves away.\n\nAfter move: head at (5,5), then body1 moves to old head position (6,5), body2 moves to old body1 position (6,6), tail moves to old body2 position (5,6).\n\nSo new snake: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nNow, (5,5) was tail but now head is there, and body is at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6).\n\nNo collision because tail moved.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (6,4) with food, as before.\n\nNow for turn 9, I need to choose.\n\nBut I have to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all options.\n\nAt turn 9, from (6,5) dir D:\n\nOption 1: Move D to (6,4) eat food.\n\nThen snake becomes: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5) — length 5.\n\nDirection now D.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (5,5) no food.\n\nThen snake: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — tail at (5,6).\n\nDirection now L (since moved left).\n\nNow, I need to think about the food and future paths.\n\nFood at (6,4) has short life, only until turn 10, so if not eaten now, might miss it.\n\n(6,4) present turns 8,9,10. So at turn 9, if not eaten, can eat at turn 10.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, other foods: (3,2) and (5,1), but farther.\n\nNow, after turn 9, if I eat (6,4), snake is at (6,4) with direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nMove D: to (6,3). (6,3) is free? Not wall, not occupied. y=3, x=6.\n\nBut y=3, between 1 and 6, yes. No food there.\n\nBut moving D to (6,3) might be towards bottom, but y=0 wall at bottom, so need to be careful.\n\nMove L: to (5,4). (5,4) free? Not occupied, no food.\n\nMove R: to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D or L possible from there? R invalid.\n\n(7,4) x=7 wall.\n\nSo if at (6,4) dir D, can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 9 I didn't eat, and moved L to (5,5), then head at (5,5) dir L.\n\nThen possible moves: from (5,5) dir L, cannot move R (opposite), so can move U, D, L.\n\nMove U: to (5,6). But (5,6) is occupied by body? Current positions after move to (5,5): snake at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] so (5,6) is the tail, I think.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body1 (6,5), body2 (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nIf move U to (5,6), which is the tail cell. Moving to tail is allowed, since tail moves.\n\n(5,6) is occupied by tail, so can move there.\n\nMove D: to (5,4), free.\n\nMove L: to (4,5), free? (4,5) was previous position, but now empty.\n\nMove R: cannot, opposite to current L.\n\nCurrent dir L, so R opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,6) tail, D to (5,4), L to (4,5).\n\nBut U to (5,6) is tail, so safe.\n\nNow, back to turn 9 decision.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4) and eat, I get +1, but snake grows, which might be riskier later.\n\nBut food is positive, so good to eat.\n\nIf I move L to (5,5), no food, but I can still eat (6,4) later.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, if I move L to (5,5), then at turn 10, I can move to (6,5) or something to eat (6,4).\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, let's consider the path to other foods.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,1), which is below, and (3,2) left.\n\nBut (6,4) is close and expiring soon.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,4), snake is at (6,4), and I need to go down or left.\n\nBut down to (6,3), etc., towards (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at y=1, so low y.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is left.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no issue yet.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above, but snake is at bottom now.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all food, but need to avoid dying.\n\nSince (6,4) is expiring in 3 turns, and I can eat it now or next turn.\n\nIf I eat it at turn 9, I get it, but snake grows, which might block paths.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can eat at turn 10, but need to be able to reach it.\n\nAt turn 9, from (6,5), if I move L to (5,5), then positions: head at (5,5), body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nThen at turn 10, head at (5,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nCan move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is not directly adjacent to (5,5). Adjacent cells are (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by body.\n\nFrom (5,5), (6,4) is diagonally down-right, not adjacent, so I cannot move directly to (6,4) from (5,5).\n\nTo reach (6,4), I need to go to (6,5) first or (5,4), but (6,5) is currently occupied by body.\n\nAt turn 10, if I am at (5,5), and I move to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by body1, which is not tail, so moving to body cell causes collision.\n\nSpecifically, from positions: head at (5,5), body at (6,5), (6,6), tail at (5,6)\n\nIf I move to (6,5), which is a body segment (not tail), so head would touch body, collision, die.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,6) is tail, which is safe.\n\nBut (6,4) is not reachable directly from (5,5).\n\nThe only way to reach (6,4) is from (6,5) or (6,3) or (5,4) or (7,4), but (7,4) wall.\n\n(6,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to (6,5) from (5,5) because it's body.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, (6,5) is still occupied unless the snake moves away.\n\nBut from (5,5), I can only move to U (5,6), D (5,4), or L (4,5).\n\nNone of which is (6,4).\n\nIf I move to (5,4), then (6,4) is adjacent to (5,4), so at turn 11, I could move to (6,4) if it's still there.\n\n(6,4) life span: at turn 8, life 3, present turns 8,9,10. So at turn 10, it is present, life span 1? At turn 10, it is present, then after turn 10, life span 0, disappears at turn 11.\n\nSo on turn 10, (6,4) is still there, can be eaten.\n\nIf at turn 9, I move L to (5,5), then at turn 10, I can move D to (5,4), for example.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction D (since moved down from (5,5)? At turn 9, after moving to (5,5), direction is L.\n\nThen at turn 10, move D to (5,4), so new direction D.\n\nThen snake positions: head at (5,4), body at (5,5), (6,5), (5,6)? After turn 9: snake at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nMove D to (5,4): no food, so snake moves: head to (5,4), body1 to (5,5), body2 to (6,5), tail to (6,6)? Positions: new head (5,4), then body1 old head (5,5), body2 old body1 (6,5), tail old body2 (6,6). And (5,6) was tail, but since no eat, tail moves, so (5,6) is vacated.\n\nNew snake: [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)] tail at (6,6)\n\nNow, from (5,4), (6,4) is adjacent right.\n\nAt turn 11, head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nCan move to (6,4) which is R, but current direction D, so R is not opposite, allowed.\n\nAnd (6,4) has food, present on turn 10? Turn 11: at turn 10, (6,4) is present, life span decreases to 0 after turn 10, so at turn 11, it should be gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 8, life 3, so present for turns 8,9,10.\n\nAt turn 11, it disappears, so not present.\n\nThus, on turn 11, cannot eat (6,4).\n\nTo eat (6,4), must be on turn 10 or earlier.\n\nAt turn 10, if I am at (5,4), I can move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 10, (6,4) is present.\n\nIn the above, if at turn 9 I move L to (5,5), then turn 10 move D to (5,4), then at turn 10, head at (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIf at turn 9 I move directly to (6,4) and eat.\n\nBut if I eat at turn 9, snake is longer earlier, which might be riskier for other moves.\n\nBut in this case, eating at turn 9 or turn 10 both possible.\n\nAt turn 10 eating, I get the food later, but same score.\n\nBut for survival, shorter snake might be better temporarily.\n\nBut since all food positive, eating early might allow eating more later.\n\nBut here only one food expiring soon.\n\nNow, other foods: (3,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\n(3,2) left.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,4), snake is around (6,4) or (5,4).\n\nBut let's consider the first move must be D for turn 8.\n\nThen for turn 9, I need to choose between eating now or later.\n\nBut eating now might be better to free the cell or something.\n\nLet's think about the tail position.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) at turn 9, tail is at (5,5), which is above.\n\nThen from (6,4) dir D, I can move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nIf move to (6,3), then towards (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so I can go down.\n\nIf move to (5,4), then left towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has life span 6, so plenty of time.\n\n(5,1) life span 9, also time.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block paths, but not immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the grid has limited space, and with walls, need to avoid trapping.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (6,3), etc., towards bottom, y=1 is wall, so I need to turn left or right.\n\nSimilarly, left side.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 8: only possible move is D to (6,5). So action: D\n\nThen turn 9: I can choose move D to (6,4) eat, or move L to (5,5) no eat.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4) eat, then turn 9 action D.\n\nThen snake at (6,4) dir D.\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,4) dir D, can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4) (since R to (7,4) wall).\n\nIf move D to (6,3), no food, so snake: head to (6,3), body to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,5)? Positions: before move, after eat at turn 9: snake at [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen move D to (6,3) no food: head to (6,3), body1 to (6,4), body2 to (6,5), body3 to (6,6), tail to (5,6). And (5,5) vacated.\n\nNew snake: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] tail (5,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen can move to (6,2) or (5,3) or (7,3) invalid, so D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\n(6,2) free, (5,3) free.\n\nAnd so on, towards (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so from (6,2) I can move L to (5,2) then D to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's not detail yet.\n\nIf at turn 10 I move L to (5,4) from (6,4).\n\nThen head to (5,4), no food, so snake: head (5,4), body1 (6,4), body2 (6,5), body3 (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nDirection L (since moved left).\n\nThen can move to (4,4), (5,5), or (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) might be occupied? Body is at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is free now? After move, positions: head (5,4), body1 (6,4), body2 (6,5), body3 (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nSo (5,5) is empty.\n\nFrom (5,4) dir L, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or R but R opposite not allowed.\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4).\n\nAll possible.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,2) or down.\n\nBut back to turn 9 alternative.\n\nIf at turn 9, I move L to (5,5) instead of eating.\n\nThen snake at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] dir L.\n\nThen turn 10: I can move D to (5,4), as earlier.\n\nThen head at (5,4), dir D.\n\nThen I can move R to (6,4) to eat the food, since (6,4) present turn 10.\n\nMove R to (6,4): from (5,4) to (6,4), which is right, current direction D, so R not opposite, allowed.\n\nAnd (6,4) has food, so eat.\n\nThen new snake: head at (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (5,6)? Positions before move: at turn 10 after move to (5,4): snake at [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (5,6)]? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 9 move L to (5,5): snake [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (5,4): no food, so head to (5,4), body1 to (5,5), body2 to (6,5), tail to (6,6)? Body2 to old body1 (6,5), tail to old body2 (6,6), but (5,6) was tail? Positions: after turn 9: head (5,5), body1 (6,5), body2 (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nMove head to (5,4), no food: new head (5,4), body1 old head (5,5), body2 old body1 (6,5), tail old body2 (6,6). And (5,6) vacated.\n\nSo snake: [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)] tail (6,6)\n\nNow move R to (6,4): (6,4) is free, has food, so eat.\n\nThen new head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) — length 5, tail (6,6)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nCompared to eating at turn 9, the snake is similar, but positions different.\n\nIf eat at turn 9, after turn 9: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nIf eat at turn 10, after turn 10: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nSo in both cases, length 5, but body configuration different.\n\nIn first case, body is vertical at x=6 from y=4 to 6, and then (5,6) and (5,5).\n\nIn second case, head at (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6).\n\nNow, for future moves, it might matter.\n\nBut for now, both allow eating (6,4).\n\nSince eating at turn 9 or 10 both possible, and no big difference, but eating at turn 9 might be safer because I do it earlier, in case something happens.\n\nBut in this case, turn 10 is fine.\n\nBut to be safe, eating at turn 9 could be done.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason to delay.\n\nAnother food: (5,1) at bottom.\n\nIf I eat at turn 9, I am at (6,4), can go down to (6,3) etc.\n\nIf I eat at turn 10, I am at (6,4) as well.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in the path where I move L at turn 9, then D to (5,4), then R to (6,4), I end up with head at (6,4) with direction R.\n\nWhereas if I eat directly at turn 9, direction D.\n\nSo different direction.\n\nBut not crucial.\n\nNow, for the other foods, I need to plan to eat (3,2) and (5,1).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is left, x=3,y=2.\n\n(5,1) at x=5,y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is top, not affecting bottom.\n\nTo reach (5,1), from (6,4), I can go down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) but y=1 is wall? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is free, but y=0 is wall, so (6,1) is free, then to (5,1) is adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) to (5,1) left.\n\nBut (6,1) is above y=0, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (3,2), from (6,4) go left to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), then down to (3,3), (3,2).\n\n(3,4) to (3,3) down, etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,6), but y=6 is high, not issue.\n\nNow, life spans: (3,2) life span 6 at turn 8, so present until turn 13.\n\n(5,1) life span 9, until turn 16.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut I need to think about the snake body blocking paths.\n\nFor example, if I go down to eat (5,1) first, the snake might block the left side.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left first, might block down.\n\nBut since grid is small, I need to be careful.\n\nAnother thing: the tail position might free up space.\n\nBut let's start with turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 must be D.\n\nThen for turn 9, I should eat the food to secure it, so move D to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 9 action D.\n\nThen at turn 10, from (6,4) dir D, I can go to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nNow, to go towards (5,1), I should go down.\n\nMove to (6,3).\n\nThen at turn 10, move D to (6,3).\n\nNo food, so snake: from [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)] move D to (6,3): head to (6,3), body1 to (6,4), body2 to (6,5), body3 to (6,6), tail to (5,6). (5,5) vacated.\n\nNew snake: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] dir D.\n\nThen turn 11: head at (6,3) dir D, can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3) (R invalid).\n\n(6,2) free, (5,3) free.\n\nMove to (6,2) to go down.\n\nThen turn 11 move D to (6,2): no food, snake: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) tail? Body: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) so tail (5,6).\n\nAfter move: head (6,2), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,4), body3 (6,5), body4 (6,6), tail (5,6)? Positions: old head (6,3) to body, etc.\n\nBefore move: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nMove D to (6,2): head (6,2), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,4), body3 (6,5), body4 (6,6), and tail? Last segment (5,6) moves to old body4 position (6,6), so tail at (6,6).\n\nNew snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] and (5,6) vacated, so tail at (6,6).\n\nAll at x=6 except tail was (5,6), now at (6,6).\n\nPositions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) so all vertical at x=6, y from 2 to 6.\n\nTail at (6,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 12: head at (6,2) dir D, can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2) (R invalid).\n\n(6,1) free, (5,2) free.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so to eat it, I need to go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\nFirst, move to (6,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf move D to (6,1), then head at (6,1), which is above wall y=0.\n\nThen from there, to go to (5,1), I need to move L to (5,1) at next turn.\n\nBut (5,1) has food.\n\nSimilarly, if from (6,2) move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 12, move to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nIf move to (6,1), then turn 13 head at (6,1) dir D (since moved down).\n\nThen can move L to (5,1) to eat, or U, but U opposite not allowed, or D to (6,0) wall invalid, or R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (5,1), which has food, so eat.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 12 move to (5,2), then turn 13 move D to (5,1) eat.\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut if I move to (6,1) at turn 12, then at (6,1), which is corner, might be riskier if I have to move immediately to (5,1).\n\nBut possible.\n\nTo be safe, move to (5,2) at turn 12.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nFirst, back to turn 10.\n\nAfter eating at turn 9, at turn 10 I moved to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 11 to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 12, from (6,2) dir D, I can move L to (5,2).\n\nThen head to (5,2), no food? (5,2) has no food, only (5,1) below.\n\nFood at (5,1), not (5,2).\n\nSo move to (5,2), dir L (since moved left from (6,2)? Current dir D, moved L, so new dir L.\n\nThen snake: from [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] move to (5,2): head (5,2), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,5), tail to (6,6)? Move: head to (5,2), body1 to old head (6,2), body2 to old body1 (6,3), etc., tail to old body4 (6,5)? Positions: before move, indices: head (6,2), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,4), body3 (6,5), body4/tail (6,6)\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new head (5,2), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,5), tail (6,6) — since no eat, tail moves to old body3 position? Body segments: after head move, body1 moves to old head pos, body2 to old body1, etc.\n\nOld positions: [A=(6,2), B=(6,3), C=(6,4), D=(6,5), E=(6,6)] A head, E tail.\n\nMove head to (5,2), no food: new head (5,2), then body1 to A (6,2), body2 to B (6,3), body3 to C (6,4), body4 to D (6,5), and E tail moves to where D was? Tail E moves to the position of the previous last body segment, which is D's position (6,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (5,2), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,5), tail (6,6) is not, tail is at (6,5), since E moved to (6,5), and (6,6) vacated.\n\nList: new head (5,2)\n\nThen body1: old head position (6,2)\n\nBody2: old body1 position (6,3)\n\nBody3: old body2 position (6,4)\n\nBody4: old body3 position (6,5)\n\nTail: old body4 position (6,6)? Body4 was (6,5), so tail moves to (6,5), but body4 is at (6,5), tail is body4.\n\nThe segments: positions after move: head (5,2), then the first body segment is at (6,2), second at (6,3), third at (6,4), fourth at (6,5), and tail at (6,6) but (6,6) is where the last body was, so it moves.\n\nSince there are 5 segments, after moving head, the body segments shift: the one at (6,2) becomes body at (6,2) for new? When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for body segment that was at B, it moves to where A was, but A is now body.\n\nBefore move: segments S0=head (6,2), S1= (6,3), S2=(6,4), S3=(6,5), S4=tail (6,6)\n\nAfter head moves to (5,2), new head at (5,2)\n\nThen S1 moves to where S0 was, (6,2)\n\nS2 moves to where S1 was, (6,3)\n\nS3 moves to where S2 was, (6,4)\n\nS4 (tail) moves to where S3 was, (6,5)\n\nAnd the old S4 position (6,6) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: head (5,2), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3), body3 (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nLength 5, tail at (6,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen at turn 13, head at (5,2) dir L, can move D to (5,1) to eat, or U to (5,3), or L to (4,2), not R.\n\n(5,1) has food, so move D to (5,1) eat.\n\nThen snake grows to length 6.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (5,1).\n\nThen later go to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), which is left and up from (5,1)? (5,1) to (3,2) is not direct.\n\nFrom (5,1), I need to go to (4,1), (3,1), then U to (3,2), but (3,1) might be wall? y=1 is free.\n\nx=3, y=2.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,6), not affecting.\n\nBut the snake body might be blocking.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,1), snake is around (5,1), with body above.\n\nThen to go left, I might be blocked.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFirst, for the immediate turns, I think eating (6,4) at turn 9 is fine.\n\nThen for turn 10, I can move to (6,3) to go down.\n\nThen turn 11 to (6,2).\n\nTurn 12 to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nTo avoid the corner, move to (5,2) at turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13 to (5,1) eat.\n\nBut at turn 12, from (6,2) dir D, if I move L to (5,2), as above.\n\nThen at turn 13 eat (5,1).\n\nNow, for the other food (3,2).\n\nAfter eating (5,1), head at (5,1) dir D or L, depending.\n\nThen I need to go to (3,2).\n\nFor example, move L to (4,1), then to (3,1), then U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut time is plenty.\n\nBut to answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns.\n\nt1=8, so I need to output actions for turn 8,9,10, etc., but how many? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list a sequence, probably at least 5 turns.\n\nSince the state might change, but I need to plan based on current.\n\nAlso, for the food, I have to consider if I can eat both (5,1) and (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), which is closer to where I am now? At turn 8, head at (6,6), (3,2) is left down.\n\nBut I am going down to eat (6,4), then to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), (3,2) is at (3,2), so I can go via (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) or (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nBut the internal obstacle at (3,6) might not block, but the snake body might be in the way.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat (3,2) before going down, but (6,4) is expiring soon, so I need to eat it first.\n\n(6,4) must be eaten by turn 10, so I have to prioritize it.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), I can choose to go left to (3,2) or down to (5,1).\n\n(3,2) life span 6, present until turn 13, so I have until turn 13 to eat it.\n\n(5,1) until turn 16.\n\nBut if I go down to (5,1) first, the snake might block the path to (3,2).\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then to (5,1), the body is along x=6, so from (5,1), to go left to (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), but (4,1) and (3,1) might be free.\n\nBut with the body at x=6, it might not block directly.\n\nBut let's assume I go to eat (5,1) first.\n\nThen from there to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is at y=2, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is free, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) etc.\n\nShould be possible.\n\nIf I go to (3,2) first, from (6,4) after turn 9, I can move L to (5,4) at turn 10.\n\nThen to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nFor the output, I can list the first few moves.\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D (eat food)\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to decide.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, let's plan a sequence to eat both foods.\n\nAfter turn 9, snake at (6,4) dir D.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,4)  no food\n\nThen snake: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)? After turn 9: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nMove L to (5,4): no food, so head to (5,4), body1 to (6,4), body2 to (6,5), body3 to (6,6), tail to (5,6). (5,5) vacated.\n\nNew: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] dir L.\n\nThen turn 11: head at (5,4) dir L, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), not R.\n\n(5,5) is free, (5,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nTo go to (3,2), I can move L to (4,4), then down or left.\n\nMove L to (4,4).\n\nThen head to (4,4), dir L.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,4) dir L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nMove L to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,6), but (3,4) is below.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nMove to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4) dir L.\n\nThen turn 13: move D to (3,3) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (3,4) move D to (3,3), then D to (3,2) eat.\n\nAt turn 13, (3,2) is present, life span 6 at turn 8, turn 13 is within, since disappears at turn 14.\n\nTurn 8 to 13 present, yes.\n\nAt turn 13, can eat.\n\nThen later go to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is far, and snake is long, might be tricky.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (5,1), need to go right and down.\n\nBut grid might be crowded.\n\nTo eat (5,1) first, shorter path.\n\nAt turn 10, from (6,4) move D to (6,3) as before.\n\nThen turn 11 to (6,2).\n\nTurn 12 to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nSay move to (5,2) at turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13 to (5,1) eat.\n\nThen at turn 14, head at (5,1) dir D or L.\n\nThen go to (3,2) by moving L to (4,1), then L to (3,1), then U to (3,2).\n\nAt turn 14, (3,2) still present? Life span 6, turn 8 to 13, so at turn 14, disappeared, since after turn 13 life span 0.\n\nTurn 8 life 6, present turns 8,9,10,11,12,13, disappear at turn 14.\n\nSo at turn 14, not present, cannot eat.\n\nMust eat (3,2) by turn 13.\n\nIf I eat (5,1) at turn 13, I can eat (3,2) at turn 13 only if I am there, but I can't be at both.\n\nAt turn 13, I can be at (5,1) or at (3,2), not both.\n\nSo if I eat (5,1) at turn 13, I miss (3,2) because it disappears at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,2) at turn 13, I can eat (5,1) later, since it lasts until turn 16.\n\nSo better to eat (3,2) first at turn 13, then (5,1) later.\n\nBut to eat (3,2) at turn 13, I need to be there.\n\nFrom current, after eating (6,4) at turn 9, at (6,4), I need to go left to (3,2) in 4 moves: turn 10,11,12,13.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,2): delta x= -3, delta y= -2, so need at least 5 moves? Manhattan distance 5, so in 4 moves possible if direct path.\n\nFor example, turn 10: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4)\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,4) move L to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), but that takes 3 moves from (4,4), so from (6,4) to (3,4) in 3 moves: (6,4)->(5,4)->(4,4)->(3,4), then to (3,3) turn 13, then (3,2) turn 14, but turn 14 (3,2) gone.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,2) is two steps down, but at turn 13 I can be at (3,3) or (3,2) if I move directly.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 12, I can move D to (4,3), then at turn 13 move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2), not directly to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is not adjacent to (4,3); from (4,3), (3,2) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I need to move to (3,3) or (4,2) first.\n\nThen to (3,2).\n\nSo from (4,4) turn 12, move D to (4,3), then turn 13 move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 14, from (3,3) move D to (3,2) but gone, or from (4,2) move L to (3,2) but gone.\n\nSo I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13 from (6,4) in 4 moves with the path.\n\nMinimum moves: from (6,4) to (3,2): diff x -3, y -2, so min 5 moves if no obstacles.\n\nFor example: (6,4)->(5,4)->(4,4)->(4,3)->(3,3)->(3,2) 5 moves.\n\nOr (6,4)->(6,3)->(5,3)->(4,3)->(4,2)->(3,2) 5 moves.\n\nSo to arrive at (3,2) on turn 13, I need to start moving on turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9 I am at (6,4), so turn 10,11,12,13: 4 moves, I can reach in 4 moves only if I go directly, but Manhattan distance 5, so impossible to reach in 4 moves.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) to (3,2), the shortest path is 5 steps: e.g., left 3 times and down 2 times, but must move one direction at a time.\n\nSo in 4 moves, I can get to (3,3) or (4,2) or (3,4), but not (3,2).\n\n(3,2) requires 5 moves from (6,4).\n\nThus, I cannot eat (3,2) on turn 13; the earliest is turn 14, but it disappears at turn 14, so I can only eat it on or before turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is the last chance.\n\nBut I can only reach on turn 14 at best, so I cannot eat (3,2) at all if I eat (6,4) at turn 9.\n\nIs that right?\n\nTurn 9: at (6,4)\n\nTurn 10: move to e.g. (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: to (3,4) or (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: if at (3,4), move to (3,3) or (2,4) etc, not (3,2)\n\nIf at (4,3), move to (3,3) or (4,2) or (4,4)\n\nThen turn 14: to (3,2) but gone.\n\nSo indeed, from (6,4) on turn 9, I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13; it's too far.\n\nBut at turn 8, I am at (6,6), and I have to move D to (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, if I move L to (5,5) instead of D to (6,4), I can go left earlier.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (5,5)  no eat\n\nThen snake at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] dir L\n\nTurn 10: move D to (5,4)  as before, to go towards (6,4) for food.\n\nThen head at (5,4) dir D\n\nTurn 11: move R to (6,4) to eat, but at turn 11, (6,4) is gone? Turn 11, (6,4) disappeared.\n\n(6,4) present turns 8,9,10, gone at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, I can eat it, as I did earlier.\n\nIn this path, at turn 10, after moving to (5,4), I move R to (6,4) to eat on turn 10.\n\nThen head at (6,4) dir R\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (3,2).\n\nAt turn 10, after eating, at (6,4)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (5,4)  no food, or D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (3,2), move L to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 12: from (5,4) dir L (since moved left), can move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 13: from (4,4) dir L, move L to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 14: move D to (3,3) or something, but (3,2) gone.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom (6,4) at turn 10, to (3,2) in 3 moves? Impossible, min 5 moves.\n\n(6,4) to (3,2) delta x-3, y-2, min 5 moves.\n\nTurn 10,11,12,13,14: 5 moves, arrive turn 14, but (3,2) gone at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 it is not present, only up to turn 13.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,2) if I eat the (6,4) food.\n\nBut (6,4) must be eaten, and it's closer.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,4) and forget about (3,2), but (3,2) is positive food, so I should try to eat it.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (6,6), and (3,2) is at (3,2), distance |6-3| + |6-2| = 3+4=7, so 7 moves away.\n\nWith 6 moves, I can reach on turn 14, but gone.\n\nTurn 8 to turn 13 is 6 turns: turn 9,10,11,12,13 actions.\n\nFrom turn 8 position (6,6), after turn 8 move to (6,5), then turn 9 move to say (5,5), turn 10 to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied? At turn 8, after move to (6,5), snake at [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)] for example.\n\nThen turn 9 move L to (5,5), but (5,5) is tail, so ok, but no move towards (3,2).\n\nTo go left, from (6,5) turn 9 move L to (5,5), then turn 10 move L to (4,5), but (4,5) was previous position? At turn 9 after move to (5,5): snake at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen turn 10 move L to (4,5)? (4,5) is free? Yes.\n\nMove to (4,5), no food.\n\nThen head at (4,5) dir L.\n\nThen turn 11 move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo (3,2), need to go down.\n\nFor example, turn 11 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12 move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13 move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 14 move to (3,2) but gone.\n\nIf from (4,5) turn 11 move L to (3,5), then turn 12 move D to (3,4), turn 13 move D to (3,3), turn 14 to (3,2) gone.\n\nStill not by turn 13.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (3,2) because it's too far and the life span is short relative to distance.\n\nLife span 6 from turn 8, so only 6 turns to eat, from turn 8 to 13.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (3,2) min 7 moves, so I cannot reach in 6 moves, thus cannot eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,5) after turn 8, min 6 moves to (3,2), but with turns: turn 9 to turn 13 is 5 moves, not enough.\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), move to e.g. (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: to (3,3) or (2,5), not (3,2)\n\nTurn 14: to (3,2) gone.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13, so I should not attempt to eat it; it's impossible.\n\nOnly possible to eat (6,4) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) has life span 9, so until turn 16, plenty of time.\n\nSo focus on that.\n\nFor turn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4) eat\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: from (6,2) dir D, move L to (5,2) to go towards (5,1)\n\nThen turn 13: from (5,2) dir L, move D to (5,1) eat\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nFor turn 14, etc., but I can stop here.\n\nNow for the output, list actions from turn 8 to turn 13 or so.\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nIn turn 12, from (6,2) move L to (5,2), then turn 13 move D to (5,1) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have moved to (6,1) at turn 12, then turn 13 move L to (5,1), but moving to (5,2) is safer to avoid corner.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nBut turn 11 move to (6,2), turn 12 to (5,2), turn 13 to (5,1).\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,4) due to its short remaining life span (must be eaten by turn 10) and then proceed toward (5,1) for another +1 score. The food at (3,2) cannot be reached before it disappears on turn 14, as the Manhattan distance from the snake's position after eating (6,4) is too great (minimum 5 moves required, but only 4 turns available from turn 10 to turn 13). Thus, (3,2) is ignored.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 8 Constraints**: Snake head is at (6,6) with direction R. Only move D to (6,5) is possible (U and R hit walls; L is reverse and not allowed).\n- **Turn 9 Decision**: From (6,5), moving D to (6,4) eats the food (+1 score, length increases to 5). Moving L to (5,5) delays eating and risks missing (6,4), but eating immediately is safer and secures the points.\n- **Path to (5,1)**: After eating (6,4), moving down toward (5,1) is efficient. The snake must avoid walls and self-collision, especially near y=1 (bottom wall). Moving left at turn 12 positions the snake to eat (5,1) on turn 13.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The sequence avoids tight spaces (e.g., near walls) and leverages tail movement rules to prevent collisions. No negative food is present, so all moves target positive rewards.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The plan covers turns 8-13 to ensure (6,4) and (5,1) are eaten while maintaining safe positions. Beyond turn 13, the snake can explore other areas, but no more food is imminent.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 8-13):\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move D to (6,5) – only valid move to avoid wall collision.\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Move D to (6,4) – eat food (+1, length=5), head now at (6,4) with direction D.\n- **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Move D to (6,3) – continue down toward (5,1), no food.\n- **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move D to (6,2) – head at (6,2), direction D.\n- **Turn 12 (t=12)**: Move L to (5,2) – avoid bottom wall risk; head at (5,2), direction L.\n- **Turn 13 (t=13)**: Move D to (5,1) – eat food (+1, length=6).\n\nThis sequence yields +2 score by turn 13. After turn 13, the snake can navigate safely (e.g., move left or up to avoid dead ends), but no further food is required in the short term.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: L \\\\\nTurn 13: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (3,6). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where the obstacle is.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments at (6,6), (5,6), and tail at (5,5). So the snake is moving downward since the head direction is D (down).\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (6,4) with life span 2 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- At (3,2) with life span 5 and value +1\n\n- At (5,1) with life span 8 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current one, so I need to consider how long each food will last.\n\nCurrent turn is 9, so:\n\n- Food at (6,4): life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 10? Let's clarify the life span. It says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 9, life span is 2, meaning after this turn (turn 9), it will have 1 left, and after turn 10, it will have 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turn 9 or 10.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (6,4): life span 2 at turn 9 → available on turn 9 and 10\n\n- (3,2): life span 5 → available from turn 9 to 13 (since 5 turns including current: turn 9,10,11,12,13? After N turns from now.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will be present for N more turns, including the current one. So:\n\n- At turn t, life span L means it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, L=2 at t=9: present on turn 9 and 10, gone on turn 11.\n\nL=5 at t=9: present from turn 9 to 13, gone on turn 14.\n\nL=8 at t=9: present from turn 9 to 16, gone on turn 17.\n\nBut since we're only planning a few turns ahead, I'll focus on the immediate ones.\n\nNow, snake head is at (6,5), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) next because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo from down, I cannot go up. Possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But R right would be to (7,5), but x=7 is a wall, so I can't go there. Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=7 is out of bounds.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is occupied by wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,5).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down (D): to (6,4). But (6,4) has food! And it's positive. But I need to check if it's safe.\n\n- Left (L): to (5,5). But (5,5) is the tail. Is that safe?\n\nRule about moving to tail: it's okay because the tail will move forward, so no collision, as long as it's not that the head is adjacent to tail and we eat food there, but that's a special case.\n\nFirst, moving to tail position is generally safe because the tail moves away.\n\nBut there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, head is at (6,5), tail is at (5,5). Are they adjacent? (6,5) and (5,5) are adjacent horizontally. Yes, since left is (5,5).\n\nTail is at (5,5), and head is moving to (5,5)? Let's see.\n\nIf I move left to (5,5), that is the current tail position.\n\nNow, (5,5) does not have food; food is at (6,4), (3,2), (5,1). None at (5,5).\n\nSo, moving to (5,5) should be fine because it's the tail, and after moving, the tail will move forward, so no collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail leaves its current cell.\n\nSo if head moves to the current tail position, since tail moves away, it's empty, so no problem.\n\nBut the Tail Reward Danger is specific to when there is food on the tail cell and we eat it while head is adjacent.\n\nHere, no food on tail, so moving to (5,5) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nPossible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Down (D) to (6,4): this has food, and it's positive. But I need to check if eating it is safe.\n\n- Left (L) to (5,5): current tail position, no food, should be safe.\n\n- Right (R) to (7,5): but x=7 is wall, so invalid. Cannot move there.\n\n- Up (U) to (6,6): but (6,6) is a body segment! Snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,6) is the next segment, so body at (6,6). Moving up to (6,6) would be collision with body, which is deadly. Also, current direction is down, moving up is instant reverse, which is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only possible moves are Down (D) to (6,4) or Left (L) to (5,5).\n\nNow, (6,4) has food with life span 2, so it can be eaten now or next turn.\n\nBut if I eat it, snake length increases by 1, so new tail will be added.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there are other foods: (3,2) and (5,1) with longer life spans.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate move on turn 9.\n\nOption 1: Move Down to (6,4), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows: new head at (6,4), body segments: (6,5) becomes first body, (6,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5). When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so positions: after moving down to (6,4) and eating, the snake becomes: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and (5,5) is still tail? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves to a food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo before move: positions [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)] head to tail.\n\nMove head to (6,4), which has food, so eat it. Then the body segments move: (6,5) becomes the new position for the first body segment, but since we eat, we add a new segment at the end.\n\nSo the new positions: head at (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) is now first body, then (6,6) second body, (5,6) third body, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, so tail is now at (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, and we add a new segment there, so positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)] — now (5,5) is the last segment, tail.\n\nLength increased by one.\n\nHead direction was down, now moving down, so new direction down.\n\nNow, after this, the snake is at: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nNow, from here, possible next moves.\n\nBut first, let's see the other option.\n\nOption 2: Move Left to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is current tail, no food there.\n\nSo move head to (5,5), no food eaten, so snake moves normally: head to (5,5), then body segments move: (6,5) becomes first body, (6,6) second body, (5,6) becomes tail? Positions: before move: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nAfter moving left to (5,5): head to (5,5), which was tail. Then the body: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to where? When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: head was at (6,5), moves to (5,5). Then the first body segment, which was at (6,6), moves to the previous position of head, (6,5). Then the second body segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (6,5), index 1: (6,6), index 2: (5,6), index 3: tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move: head moves to (5,5) — but (5,5) was index 3, tail.\n\nNow, the new head position is (5,5). Then, the body segment that was at index 1 (6,6) moves to where index 0 was, (6,5). Then index 2 (5,6) moves to where index 1 was, (6,6). Then the tail, index 3 (5,5), but since head moved to (5,5), and it's not eating, the tail moves to where the previous segment was? When not eating, the tail moves off its position.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it, and the tail is removed from its position.\n\nSo in this case: head moves to (5,5) — which is the same as old tail position.\n\nThen, the first body segment (index 1) at (6,6) moves to the old head position (6,5). Second body segment (index 2) at (5,6) moves to where index 1 was, (6,6). Then, since no growth, the tail (index 3 at (5,5)) is removed, but the head is now at (5,5), so it's occupied, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,5), then body segments: index 1 at (6,5) — which is the old head position, index 2 at (6,6) — old position of index 1, and no index 3 since tail was removed? Length is 4, after move without eating, length same, so only 3 segments? No.\n\nInitial snake has 4 segments: head and 3 body/tail.\n\nAfter eating, 5 segments.\n\nWithout eating, when moving, head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the last position is vacated.\n\nSo for 4-segment snake: positions P0, P1, P2, P3 with P0 head, P3 tail.\n\nAfter move to new head position N:\n\n- New P0: N\n\n- New P1: old P0\n\n- New P2: old P1\n\n- New P3: old P2  (since tail moves to where P2 was, and P3 is gone)\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,5) which is old P3.\n\nNew head: (5,5) — old P3\n\nThen new P1: old P0 (6,5)\n\nNew P2: old P1 (6,6)\n\nNew P3: old P2 (5,6)  — and old P3 (5,5) is now head, so the cell is occupied.\n\nPositions become: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] with head at (5,5), tail at (5,6).\n\nAnd head direction: since we moved left from (6,5) to (5,5), new direction is left (L).\n\nNow, back to turn 9 decision.\n\nIf I move down to (6,4) and eat food, snake grows to length 5, positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nIf I move left to (5,5), no eat, positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nNow, food at (6,4) has life span 2, so if not eaten now, it might be eaten later, but only if we move there.\n\nLife span: at turn 9, it has life span 2, so after turn 9, it will have 1 left, so available on turn 10.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 9, I can eat it on turn 10 if I go there.\n\nBut if I move left on turn 9, I'm at (5,5), then on turn 10, I might go to (6,4) or other places.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2) and (5,1), which are farther, with life spans 5 and 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut the immediate food at (6,4) is close and will disappear soon.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but also, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid layout.\n\nPlayable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except wall at (3,6).\n\nSo cells:\n\nList all cells for clarity.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWall at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: currently (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nFood at (6,4), (3,2), (5,1)\n\nNow, if I move down to (6,4) on turn 9, I eat it, snake becomes longer as above.\n\nThen on turn 10, head at (6,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,4), down to (6,3) — y=3 is within bounds, no wall.\n\nLeft to (5,4)\n\nRight to (7,4) invalid, wall.\n\nUp to (6,5) — but (6,5) is a body segment, collision, deadly. Also, instant reverse from down to up not allowed.\n\nSo possible: down or left.\n\nIf down to (6,3), no food there.\n\nIf left to (5,4), no food.\n\nNow, food at (6,4) is eaten, so gone.\n\nOther foods: (3,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at y=1, which is border, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, except borders.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are ok.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(5,1) is at bottom, playable.\n\nBut from (6,4), if I go down to (6,3), then I can continue down towards (5,1) or other.\n\nBut let's see the snake position after eating on turn 9.\n\nPositions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nNow, if on turn 10 I move down to (6,3), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,3), then bodies to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5) is removed? No.\n\nWith growth: after eating on turn 9, snake has 5 segments.\n\nOn turn 10, moving without eating (assuming no food at (6,3) or (5,4)), so head moves to new position, say (6,3), then new positions: head (6,3), P1: old head (6,4), P2: old P1 (6,5), P3: old P2 (6,6), P4: old P3 (5,6), and old P4 (5,5) is removed.\n\nSo positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) with tail at (5,6).\n\nHead direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,2), (5,3), etc., towards (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is at (5,1), which is down left.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 10 from (6,4) I move left to (5,4), no food, then positions: head (5,4), P1: (6,4), P2: (6,5), P3: (6,6), P4: (5,6), tail at (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is occupied, but after move, P4 is at (5,6), which is fine.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), left to (4,4), up to (5,5) but (5,5) is not occupied now? After moving to (5,4), positions are (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is empty.\n\n(5,5) was tail before, but removed.\n\nNow, back to turn 9, if I move left to (5,5) instead.\n\nOn turn 9, move left to (5,5), no eat, positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) with head at (5,5), direction left.\n\nThen on turn 10, possible moves from (5,5):\n\nDown to (5,4) — no food\n\nLeft to (4,5) — no food\n\nUp to (5,6) — but (5,6) is a body segment! Positions: (5,5) head, (6,5) body, (6,6) body, (5,6) tail. So (5,6) is tail, but moving up to (5,6) would be to the tail position.\n\nIs it safe? Generally, moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n\nBut check if Tail Reward Danger: head at (5,5), adjacent to tail (5,6)? (5,5) and (5,6) are adjacent vertically, since y differs by 1.\n\nx same, y+1 or y-1.\n\n(5,5) to (5,6) is up, adjacent.\n\nTail at (5,6), and it has food? No, no food at (5,6), so moving to (5,6) should be safe, and no growth.\n\nAlso, instant reverse: current direction left, moving up is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nOpposite of left is right, up is perpendicular.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- Down to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (5,6)  // to tail\n\n- Right to (6,5) but (6,5) is body segment, collision, and instant reverse? Current direction left, right is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: down, left, up.\n\nIf I move up to (5,6), which is tail, no food, so snake moves: head to (5,6), then bodies: P1 to old head (5,5), P2 to old P1 (6,5), P3 to old P2 (6,6), and tail removed? Positions before: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nAfter move up to (5,6): head to (5,6), which was tail. Then P1 to (5,5), P2 to (6,5), P3 to (6,6), and old P3 (5,6) is now head, so positions: (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) with tail at (6,6).\n\nHead direction up.\n\nThen from there, I can access other areas.\n\nBut I also have the food at (6,4) which is still available on turn 10.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move left to (5,5), then on turn 10 I can move down to (5,4) or left to (4,5), or up to (5,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is down from (6,5), but from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4), then to (6,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,4) from (5,5) on turn 10: if I move down to (5,4) on turn 10, then (6,4) is adjacent, I can go right to (6,4) on turn 11.\n\nBut food at (6,4) has life span 2 at turn 9, so on turn 10, life span 1, available on turn 10, gone after turn 10, so on turn 11 it's gone.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 9, life span 2: present turn 9 and 10, gone turn 11.\n\nSo if I don't eat on turn 9, I can eat on turn 10 if I move to (6,4).\n\nBut on turn 10, if I'm at (5,5), I can go directly to (6,4)? From (5,5), possible moves are down to (5,4), left to (4,5), up to (5,6), not directly to (6,4) because not adjacent diagonally, only U/D/L/R.\n\n(6,4) is not adjacent to (5,5); adjacent cells are (5,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,5) but (6,5) is body.\n\nSo to reach (6,4) from (5,5), I need to go to (5,4) or (6,5) but (6,5) not accessible, so only via (5,4).\n\nOn turn 10, from (5,5), if I move down to (5,4), then (6,4) is to the right, but from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4) on turn 11, but on turn 11, food is gone, since life span ends after turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 is the last chance to eat (6,4).\n\nSo if I don't move to (6,4) on turn 9 or 10, I miss it.\n\nOn turn 10, if I'm at (5,5), I can only go to (5,4), (4,5), or (5,6), none of which is (6,4), so I cannot reach (6,4) on turn 10 from (5,5) in one move. I need to be at (6,5) or (6,3) or (5,4) or (7,4) to reach (6,4), but (7,4) invalid, (6,3) not adjacent, only (6,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,4) but (7,4) wall, (6,3) not directly adjacent? (6,4) adjacent cells: (6,5) above, (6,3) below, (5,4) left, (7,4) right invalid.\n\nSo to be at (6,4) on turn 10, I need to be at one of its adjacent cells on turn 9: (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), or (7,4).\n\nOn turn 9, snake head is at (6,5), which is one of them.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move down to (6,4), I eat it on turn 9.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move left to (5,5), then on turn 9 I'm at (5,5), not adjacent to (6,4), so on turn 10 I cannot move directly to (6,4) from (5,5). The only way to reach (6,4) on turn 10 is if I move to a cell adjacent to it on turn 9, but from (6,5), moving down to (6,4) or left to (5,5) or right invalid or up invalid.\n\nIf I move left to (5,5) on turn 9, I'm at (5,5) on turn 9, which is not adjacent to (6,4), so on turn 10, from (5,5), I can go to (5,4) or (4,5) or (5,6), none adjacent to (6,4), so I cannot move to (6,4) on turn 10. Therefore, if I don't eat on turn 9, I miss the food at (6,4) forever.\n\nIs that right?\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to (6,4)? Yes, (5,4) and (6,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf on turn 10 I am at (5,4), I can move right to (6,4).\n\nBut on turn 10, I need to be at (5,4) to do that.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move left to (5,5), then on turn 10, I can move down to (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 10, I am at (5,4), and I can move to (6,4) on turn 11? But food disappears after turn 10, so on turn 11 it's gone.\n\nAt turn 10, if I am at (5,4), I can move to (6,4) on turn 10? No, turns are discrete.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nTurn t: I am at position at start of turn, I choose action, move to new position.\n\nIf I move to a food cell, I eat it during the move.\n\nLife span: at turn t, food has life span L, it will be present for this turn and L-1 more turns, so it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1.\n\nFor (6,4) at turn 9, life span 2, so can be eaten on turn 9 or 10.\n\nOn turn 10, it is still present, so if I move to (6,4) on turn 10, I can eat it.\n\nNow, to move to (6,4) on turn 10, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 9, and move to it on turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (6,5).\n\nIf I move down on turn 9, I go to (6,4) and eat on turn 9.\n\nIf I move left on turn 9 to (5,5), then on turn 9 I end at (5,5).\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (5,5), and I can move down to (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 10, I am at (5,4), but (6,4) is adjacent, so I could move to (6,4) on turn 10? But on turn 10, when I am at (5,4), I can choose to move to (6,4), which is right.\n\nBut (6,4) is adjacent to (5,4), so yes, on turn 10, if I am at (5,4), I can move right to (6,4) and eat it, since it is still present on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, if I were at (6,5) on turn 9 and move down on turn 9, I eat on turn 9.\n\nIf I move left on turn 9 to (5,5), then on turn 10 from (5,5) I move down to (5,4), and on that move, I don't eat yet, I am now at (5,4) for turn 10.\n\nThen on turn 10, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4), and since it's turn 10 and food is present, I eat it.\n\nBut on turn 10, when I move to (6,4), it is eaten during turn 10 move.\n\nYes.\n\nSo it is possible to eat on turn 10 by first moving left on turn 9 to (5,5), then down to (5,4) on turn 10, but that doesn't get me to (6,4) on turn 10; it gets me to (5,4) on turn 10.\n\nTo reach (6,4) on turn 10, I need to be at a cell adjacent to it at the start of turn 10.\n\nAt start of turn 10, where am I?\n\nAfter turn 9 action:\n\n- If I moved down on turn 9, at start of turn 10, head is at (6,4)\n\n- If I moved left on turn 9, at start of turn 10, head is at (5,5)\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 10, I can move to (5,4), (4,5), or (5,6), but not directly to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is not adjacent to (5,5), so I cannot move directly to (6,4) from (5,5).\n\nThe only cells adjacent to (6,4) are (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4).\n\nAt start of turn 10, if I am at one of those, I can move to (6,4).\n\nBut if on turn 9 I moved left to (5,5), at turn 10 I am at (5,5), not at (6,5) or (5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(6,5) is where I was, but I moved away.\n\nSo from (5,5), I cannot reach (6,4) on turn 10; the closest I can be is at (5,4) on turn 10, then on turn 11 I can go to (6,4) but food is gone.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (6,4) is on turn 9 by moving down to it.\n\nIf I don't, it disappears and I miss it.\n\nSo for the food at (6,4), I must eat it on turn 9 to get it; otherwise, it's lost.\n\nNow, is it worth eating? It's positive food, +1 score, and length increase.\n\nBut I need to consider risks.\n\nIf I eat it, snake becomes longer, which might be riskier in the small grid.\n\nGrid is 6x6 minus one obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, but walls and obstacle reduce space.\n\nPlayable cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells, minus wall at (3,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 4, after eating 5.\n\nThen I have to avoid colliding with itself.\n\nAlso, there are other foods to consider.\n\nBut first, let's see what happens if I eat it.\n\nOn turn 9, move down to (6,4), eat, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nNow on turn 10, from (6,4), possible moves: down to (6,3), or left to (5,4).\n\nUp to (6,5) is body, invalid; right invalid.\n\nSay I move down to (6,3) on turn 10, no food, so snake moves: head to (6,3), then bodies to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (5,5) removed? After eating on turn 9, length 5.\n\nOn turn 10, move to (6,3), no food, so no growth, head to (6,3), P1 to (6,4), P2 to (6,5), P3 to (6,6), P4 to (5,6), and old P4 (5,5) vacated.\n\nPositions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nHead direction down.\n\nNow from (6,3), I can go down to (6,2), left to (5,3), or right invalid, up to (6,4) body.\n\nSo down or left.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so I can go down to (6,2), then (6,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2).\n\nBut there is a wall at (3,6), which is not in the way yet.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) has life span 8, so available for many turns.\n\nSimilarly (3,2) life span 5.\n\nIf I don't eat the (6,4) food, I avoid growing now, but I lose the point.\n\nBut let's consider the move left option on turn 9.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move left to (5,5), no eat, positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nHead direction left.\n\nThen on turn 10, I can move down to (5,4), or left to (4,5), or up to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is tail, moving there is safe as discussed.\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), P1 (5,5), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), tail at (6,6)? Before move: positions (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nAfter move down to (5,4): head to (5,4), P1 to old head (5,5), P2 to old P1 (6,5), P3 to old P2 (6,6), and old P3 (5,6) removed.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nHead direction down (since moved down).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), left to (4,4), right to (6,4) but (6,4) has food but it's gone after turn 10, so on turn 11 not there.\n\nAt turn 10, from (5,4), I can move to (6,4) if I want, but on turn 10, food at (6,4) is still there, so I can eat it on turn 10.\n\nBut to do that, on turn 10, from (5,4), I can move right to (6,4) and eat it.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut in this case, I ate it on turn 10 instead of turn 9.\n\nBut in terms of score, same +1, but I have the food for one less turn, but since I eat it, it's fine.\n\nBut in the first option, I eat on turn 9, in second on turn 10.\n\nBut if I eat on turn 9, I have a longer snake earlier, which might be riskier.\n\nBut let's compare the state after eating.\n\nFirst, if I eat on turn 9:\n\nAfter turn 9: snake at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 10, I move to (6,3) for example, positions (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nThen I can go to (6,2), (6,1), etc.\n\nIf I eat on turn 10:\n\nOn turn 9 move left to (5,5), positions (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nOn turn 10 move down to (5,4), then from (5,4) move right to (6,4) and eat.\n\nAfter eating on turn 10: head to (6,4), bodies: P1 to (5,4) — old position? When moving to (6,4) from (5,4), eat, so new positions: head (6,4), P1 old head (5,4), P2 old P1 (5,5), P3 old P2 (6,5), P4 old P3 (6,6), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position, but old tail was at (5,6)? Before move on turn 10: at start turn 10, positions (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nHead at (5,5), move down to (5,4), but (5,4) has no food, so no eat, move to (5,4), positions become (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) with tail at (6,6)? After moving down to (5,4): head (5,4), P1 (5,5), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), and old P3 (5,6) removed.\n\nThen from (5,4), move right to (6,4) and eat, so head to (6,4), bodies: P1 to (5,4), P2 to (5,5), P3 to (6,5), and add new segment at old tail position, which was (6,6), so positions: head (6,4), P1 (5,4), P2 (5,5), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6)\n\nLength 5.\n\nCompare to eating on turn 9: after turn 10 move to (6,3), positions (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nIn both cases, after eating and one more move, the snake has similar positions, but slightly different.\n\nIn first case: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nIn second case: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nThe second one has the snake more spread out, not all in a row.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, eating the food gives me a point, but makes the snake longer, which could lead to trapping myself later.\n\nBut the grid has space, and there are other foods.\n\nIf I don't eat, I save the space for later, but I lose a point.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should eat it to increase score, as long as it doesn't risk immediate death.\n\nIn this case, moving down to (6,4) on turn 9 seems safe, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (5,5) is also safe.\n\nBut by moving left, I can still eat the food on turn 10, as above.\n\nIn the move left then down then right, I eat on turn 10.\n\nBut in terms of turns, it takes an extra turn to eat it, but I get the point.\n\nBut the score is the same, +1.\n\nHowever, by delaying, I have a shorter snake for one more turn, which might be slightly safer, but not significantly.\n\nBut there might be a risk.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nI should consider the path to other foods.\n\nFor example, food at (5,1) is at bottom left, and (3,2) is left middle.\n\nWith the snake at (6,5), if I go down to (6,4), I'm closer to (5,1).\n\nIf I go left to (5,5), I'm more central.\n\nBut since (6,4) food is expiring soon, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nMoreover, it's only 2 life span, so I need to act now.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, suppose I eat on turn 9: move D to (6,4)\n\nThen on turn 10, I need to move from (6,4). Options: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf I go to (6,3), then on turn 11, from (6,3) I can go D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or U to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, so D or L.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so I can go down to (6,2), then (6,1), then left to (5,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,3) go left to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then left to (5,1)? (5,1) is down.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) has life span 8, so no rush.\n\nAlso, food at (3,2), which is at x=3,y=2.\n\nFrom current position, to reach (3,2), I need to go left.\n\nBut with the snake, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe internal wall at (3,6) might not affect lower areas.\n\nNow, if on turn 10 from (6,4) I go left to (5,4), then positions: head (5,4), P1 (6,4), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), P4 (5,6) after move.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or U to (5,5) but (5,5) might be empty or not, in this case after move, (5,5) is not occupied, so U to (5,5) possible.\n\nBut (5,5) has no food.\n\nThen to (3,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut let's see the other option where I don't eat immediately.\n\nSuppose on turn 9 I move L to (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 10, I can move D to (5,4) as above, then on turn 10 from (5,4) I can move R to (6,4) to eat, as I said.\n\nBut on turn 10, after moving to (5,4), I am at (5,4), and I can choose to move to (6,4) to eat or not.\n\nIf I do, I eat on turn 10.\n\nIf not, I miss it.\n\nBut I should eat it to get the point.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat the (6,4) food, either on turn 9 or turn 10.\n\nEating on turn 9 might be better because I get the point earlier, and the snake grows, but I can start moving towards other foods.\n\nEating on turn 10 delays the growth by one turn.\n\nBut since the score is the same, and the grid is small, longer snake might be harder, but not immediately.\n\nAnother consideration: the food at (6,4) might be under the body? No, currently at turn 9, snake is at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), food at (6,4) is below, not under body.\n\nIt can be eaten directly.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should also look at the other foods.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is closer to the bottom, (3,2) is left.\n\nThe snake is currently in the bottom-right area.\n\nTo reach (3,2), I need to go left, but there is a wall at (3,6), which is at y=6, so for lower y, it's fine.\n\ny=2 is low.\n\nPlayable cells: for example, from (6,5), if I go left, I can go to (4,5), (3,5), but (3,5) is playable, (3,6) is wall, so (3,5) is ok, then down to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, to (5,1), from (6,5) down to (6,4), (6,3), etc.\n\nBut with the snake body, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I eat on turn 9 and go down, the snake is vertical at x=6 from y=3 to 6, and (5,6), so it blocks the right side.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go left to (5,3), then down to (5,2), (5,1), etc.\n\nOr go down to (6,2), (6,1), then left to (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), (5,1) is adjacent left, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is farther.\n\nSince (5,1) has life span 8, I can go to (3,2) first or later.\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 5, so available until turn 13, and current turn 9, so 5 turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) life span 8, many turns.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all foods, so I need to plan a path.\n\nBut for now, since (6,4) is about to expire, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, not eating it means losing a point, which is bad for score.\n\nSo I think I should eat it on turn 9.\n\nThen, after that, I can plan the next moves.\n\nBut the answer needs to be for multiple turns.\n\nThe output should be for turn 9, 10, 11, etc., up to 5 turns or so.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 9.\n\nFirst, on turn 9, I move D to (6,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen on turn 10, I need to choose where to go.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go D to (6,3), I am closer to (5,1).\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), I am more central.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupation.\n\nAfter eating on turn 9, positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nOn turn 10, if I move D to (6,3), positions become: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) with tail at (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 11, from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or U to (6,4) body.\n\nSay I go D to (6,2), no food, positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) with tail at (6,6)? After move: head (6,2), P1 (6,3), P2 (6,4), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6), old P4 (5,6) removed.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nNow all at x=6, y=2 to 6.\n\nThen on turn 12, from (6,2), I can go D to (6,1), L to (5,2), U to (6,3) body.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so I can go down to (6,1), then left to (5,1) to eat.\n\nOn turn 12, move D to (6,1), no food, positions: head (6,1), P1 (6,2), P2 (6,3), P3 (6,4), P4 (6,5), tail (6,6) removed? Move to (6,1), no eat, so head (6,1), P1 (6,2), P2 (6,3), P3 (6,4), P4 (6,5), and old P4 (6,6) removed.\n\nPositions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 13, from (6,1), I can go L to (5,1) to eat the food there.\n\n(5,1) has food, so move left to (5,1), eat, grow.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), P1 (6,1), P2 (6,2), P3 (6,3), P4 (6,4), and add new segment at old tail position, which was (6,5), so P5 (6,5).\n\nLength 6.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I have food at (3,2) to eat as well.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), life span 5 at turn 9, so available until turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, if I am at (6,1), and I move to (5,1) on turn 13, I eat (5,1).\n\nBut (3,2) is at (3,2), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can go up to (5,2), then left to (4,2), (3,2), but on turn 14 or later.\n\nAt turn 13, (3,2) is still available if life span allows.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 9: present turn 9 to 13, gone turn 14.\n\nSo on turn 13, it is still there.\n\nAfter eating (5,1) on turn 13, head at (5,1), I can on turn 14 move up to (5,2), then to (4,2) on turn 15, then to (3,2) on turn 16, but on turn 16, food is gone since disappeared after turn 13? No.\n\nLife span: at turn 9, life span 5, so can be eaten on turns 9,10,11,12,13. Disappears after turn 13, so not available on turn 14.\n\nSo last chance turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, if I am at (5,1), I cannot reach (3,2) in one move; it's two moves away: to (4,1) or (5,2), then to (3,2) or (4,2), etc., not directly.\n\nSo on turn 13, I cannot eat (3,2) if I am at (5,1); I need to be closer earlier.\n\nTherefore, in this path, I might miss (3,2).\n\nAfter eating (6,4) on turn 9, if on turn 10 I go left to (5,4) instead of down.\n\nOn turn 9: move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,4) no food (assuming), positions: head (5,4), P1 (6,4), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), P4 (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 11, from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), L to (4,4), U to (5,5) (empty).\n\nSay I go L to (4,4), no food, positions: head (4,4), P1 (5,4), P2 (6,4), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6)\n\nThen on turn 12, from (4,4), go L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so I need to go down.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut life span: turn 9 to 13 for (3,2).\n\nOn turn 12, I can be at (4,2) or (3,3), then on turn 13 to (3,2).\n\nFor example, on turn 12 from (4,4) move D to (4,3), then on turn 13 move D to (4,2), but (4,2) not (3,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3) on turn 13, then on turn 14 to (3,2) but gone.\n\nTo reach (3,2) by turn 13.\n\nOn turn 12, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (3,2), like (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is y=1, playable.\n\n(2,2) x=2, playable.\n\nFrom current, on turn 11 at (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) on turn 11, then on turn 12 move D to (4,2), then on turn 13 move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\n(4,2) to (3,2) is left, adjacent.\n\nAnd on turn 13, it is available.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 11 I am at (4,4), move to (4,3) on turn 11, positions: head (4,3), P1 (4,4), P2 (5,4), P3 (6,4), P4 (6,5)\n\nThen turn 12, move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), P1 (4,3), P2 (4,4), P3 (5,4), P4 (6,4)\n\nThen turn 13, move L to (3,2), which has food, eat, grow.\n\nThen good.\n\n(5,1) can be eaten later, life span 8.\n\nNow, back to turn 9, if I don't eat (6,4) immediately and move left first.\n\nOn turn 9 move L to (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 10, move D to (5,4)\n\nThen on turn 10, from (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) to eat the food, as it is turn 10.\n\nSo positions on turn 10 after move: head to (6,4) eat, bodies: P1 (5,4), P2 (5,5), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6) — similar to before.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2) or (5,1).\n\nBut to reach (3,2) by turn 13, I need to move left.\n\nFor example, on turn 11 from (6,4) move L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body? After eating on turn 10, positions: head (6,4), P1 (5,4), P2 (5,5), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6)\n\nFrom (6,4), on turn 11, I can move L to (5,4) but (5,4) is P1, body segment, collision! Cannot move there.\n\nMove D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) body or R invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,3) or if possible, but only D or? Left to (5,4) is occupied, so only down to (6,3).\n\nThen similar to first path.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 10, but I should to not lose the point.\n\nIn this case, after moving left on turn 9 and down on turn 10 to (5,4), if I move to (6,4) on turn 10, I eat, but then on turn 11, from (6,4) I can only move down to (6,3), as left is body.\n\nThen I'm in a similar situation as eating on turn 9 and going down.\n\nBut I have less time to reach (3,2) because I used turns to eat the food.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating on turn 9 vs turn 10, for (3,2) which must be eaten by turn 13, I have from turn 10 to 13 or 11 to 13.\n\nBut with the snake position, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the (6,4) food at all to keep the snake shorter and have more mobility to reach (3,2) faster.\n\nBut losing a point is bad, and (6,4) is positive food, so I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, with life span 2, it's about to disappear.\n\nI think the best is to eat it on turn 9 and then head towards (3,2) immediately.\n\nSo on turn 9: move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen on turn 10: move L to (5,4) to start going left.\n\nFrom (6,4), move L to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), P1 (6,4), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), P4 (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 11: from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4), D to (5,3), or U to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is empty now.\n\nTo go to (3,2), I should go left or down.\n\nSay move L to (4,4) on turn 11, no food, positions: head (4,4), P1 (5,4), P2 (6,4), P3 (6,5), P4 (6,6)\n\nThen on turn 12: from (4,4), move L to (3,4), or D to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,4) is playable, no wall, wall at (3,6) only.\n\nMove to (3,4) on turn 12, positions: head (3,4), P1 (4,4), P2 (5,4), P3 (6,4), P4 (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 13: from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) body, U to (3,5).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so I need to go down.\n\nMove D to (3,3) on turn 13, but (3,2) is at (3,2), not eaten yet.\n\nOn turn 13, from (3,4) move D to (3,3), then on turn 14 to (3,2) but food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) or adjacent on turn 12.\n\nOn turn 12, if I am at (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) instead of L to (3,4).\n\nOn turn 12 from (4,4) move D to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), P1 (4,4), P2 (5,4), P3 (6,4), P4 (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 13, from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), D to (4,2), or R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move to (4,2) or (3,3) on turn 13.\n\nSay move to (4,2) on turn 13, then (3,2) is not reached; I need to move to a cell that allows me to reach (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nBut from (4,3), moving to (3,3) on turn 13, then (3,2) is adjacent, but on turn 14.\n\nNot on turn 13.\n\nThe only way to eat on turn 13 is to be at (3,2) on that turn.\n\nTo be at (3,2) on turn 13, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 12, like (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2).\n\nOn turn 12, where can I be?\n\nFrom the sequence, on turn 11 at (4,4), I can move to (4,3), (3,4), or (4,5), etc.\n\nTo be at (3,3) on turn 12, for example.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 11, I can move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), but not directly to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is not adjacent to (4,4); it's diagonal.\n\nSo on turn 12, the closest I can be to (3,2) is (3,4), (4,3), (3,3) not reachable from (4,4) in one move.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can be at (3,4) or (4,3) on turn 12.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 12, I can move D to (3,3) on turn 13, then to (3,2) on turn 14 too late.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 12, move L to (3,3) on turn 13, then to (3,2) on turn 14.\n\nNo way to reach (3,2) by turn 13 from this path because on turn 9 I ate (6,4) and started left late.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,4) and go directly towards (3,2).\n\nOn turn 9, move L to (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 10, instead of going down to (5,4) to eat (6,4), I go left to (4,5) for example.\n\nBut then I miss the (6,4) food.\n\nLet's say I skip (6,4) to save time for (3,2).\n\nOn turn 9: move L to (5,5) no eat.\n\nPositions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nOn turn 10: move L to (4,5) no food, positions: head (4,5), P1 (5,5), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), tail at (6,6)? After move: head (4,5), P1 (5,5), P2 (6,5), P3 (6,6), old P3 (5,6) removed.\n\nPositions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nThen on turn 11: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), D to (4,4), U to (4,6) but y=6 is not wall, y=6 is playable, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 ok.\n\n(4,6) is empty.\n\nMove to (3,5) on turn 11, positions: head (3,5), P1 (4,5), P2 (5,5), P3 (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 12: from (3,5), move D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), etc.\n\nMove D to (3,4) on turn 12, positions: head (3,4), P1 (3,5), P2 (4,5), P3 (5,5)\n\nThen on turn 13: from (3,4), move D to (3,3) or L to (2,4), etc.\n\n(3,2) is below, so move D to (3,3) on turn 13, then on turn 14 to (3,2) but gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, from (3,4) on turn 13 move directly to (3,2)? Not adjacent.\n\nSo still not on time.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 12, move directly to (3,3)? Not possible.\n\nThe only way to reach (3,2) by turn 13 is to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 10, from (5,5), instead of moving left, move down to (5,4), then on turn 11 move L to (4,4), turn 12 move L to (3,4), turn 13 move D to (3,3) not (3,2).\n\nOr from (5,4) on turn 11 move D to (5,3), turn 12 move L to (4,3), turn 13 move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2), not (3,2).\n\nIt seems difficult to reach (3,2) by turn 13 from the initial position because it's 4 moves away: from (6,5) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2), 4 moves to (3,5), then one more to (3,4), etc.\n\nMinimum distance: from (6,5) to (3,2) is |6-3| + |5-2| = 3+3=6 cells, so at least 6 moves, but with the snake body, it might be more.\n\nFrom turn 9 to turn 13 is 5 turns: turn 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nOn turn 9 I move, turn 13 I move, so 5 moves.\n\nBut distance 6, so I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13 if I start from (6,5) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 action: move to new position at end of turn 9.\n\nTurn 10 move, etc.\n\nOn turn 13 action, I move to a position.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to move to (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nSo I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 12.\n\nThe adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2).\n\nOn turn 12, I need to be at one of those.\n\nFor example, (3,3) can be reached from (3,4), (3,2) not, (4,3), (2,3), etc.\n\nBut from initial, it might be tight.\n\nFor instance, if on turn 9 I move L to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10 move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11 move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12 move D to (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 13 I can move to (3,3), but not to (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 12, I can move directly to (3,3)? No, only to (3,4), (3,6) but (3,6) wall, or (2,5), (4,5).\n\nSo I can only be at (3,4) on turn 12, then on turn 13 to (3,3), not (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, to be at (4,2) on turn 12, from (6,5) it's farther.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (3,2) by turn 13 because the minimum moves required are more than the turns left.\n\nAt turn 9, 5 turns to turn 13, but distance 6, so cannot reach.\n\nTherefore, I will miss the (3,2) food anyway.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 9: available on turns 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nOn turn 13, I can eat it if I reach it.\n\nBut to reach (3,2) on turn 13, I need to be there on that turn.\n\nFrom (6,5) on turn 9, after move, at (5,5) if move left, or (6,4) if move down.\n\nThen on turn 10, from (5,5) I can be at (4,5) or (5,4) or (5,6).\n\nSay (4,5) on turn 10.\n\nTurn 11 from (4,5) to (3,5) or (4,4) or (4,6).\n\nSay (3,5) on turn 11.\n\nTurn 12 from (3,5) to (3,4) or (2,5) or (3,6) invalid.\n\nSay (3,4) on turn 12.\n\nTurn 13 from (3,4) to (3,3), not (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 12, I can move to (3,3) on turn 13, but (3,2) is not adjacent; I need to move to (3,2) directly.\n\nBut from (3,4) to (3,2) is not adjacent; it's two steps down.\n\nSo I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach (3,2) by turn 13 from the initial position on turn 9.\n\nThe food at (3,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, only (5,1) and (6,4) can be eaten, but (6,4) must be eaten on turn 9 or 10.\n\n(5,1) has life span 8, so can be eaten later.\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should eat (6,4) and then (5,1).\n\nSince (3,2) is unreachable in time, I can ignore it.\n\nSo back to turn 9: move D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 10, move L to (5,4) to start moving towards center or down to (6,3) to go to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so from (6,4), going down to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then left to (5,1) is efficient.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 10, move D to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 11 move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12 move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 13 move L to (5,1) to eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I go left first, it takes more turns.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L to (5,1) eat.\n\nBut on turn 12, at (6,1), move to (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd (3,2) is not eaten, but we can't reach it in time.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 9 to, say, turn 13 or 14.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nSo actions for turn 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nBut on turn 13, moving L to (5,1) from (6,1), which is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 9 to 13). The key considerations are:\n- The food at (6,4) has a short life span (2 at turn 9, so it disappears after turn 10) and must be eaten on turn 9 or 10 to gain +1 score. Eating it on turn 9 is efficient and safe.\n- The food at (3,2) has a life span of 5 (available until turn 13), but it is 6 moves away from the starting position (6,5). Given the distance and snake constraints, it cannot be reached by turn 13 and will disappear uneaten. Prioritizing it would risk missing the (6,4) food and provide no benefit.\n- The food at (5,1) has a life span of 8 (available until turn 16) and can be safely targeted after eating (6,4).\n- After eating (6,4) on turn 9, moving down repeatedly (turns 10-12) efficiently paths toward (5,1) while avoiding collisions. The grid has space, and this route minimizes risk with the snake's length increase.\n- Moving left on turn 13 to (5,1) eats the food safely, as it is still within its life span.\n\n**Action Sequence (5 turns):**\n- **Turn 9: D (down)** – Move to (6,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 5). This is safe and captures the expiring reward.\n- **Turn 10: D (down)** – Move to (6,3). No food, but positions the snake to continue toward (5,1) without risk. Direction is now down.\n- **Turn 11: D (down)** – Move to (6,2). No food, safe down move. Direction down.\n- **Turn 12: D (down)** – Move to (6,1). No food, safe down move. Direction down.\n- **Turn 13: L (left)** – Move to (5,1) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 6). This is safe, as (5,1) is adjacent and the path avoids collisions.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- Both accessible positive foods are eaten, maximizing score (+2 over 5 turns).\n- Long-term survival: The path avoids walls, obstacles (e.g., (3,6) is not approached), and body collisions. The snake remains in open areas, with no dead ends in the near term.\n- The food at (3,2) is not pursued, as it is unreachable by turn 13 and would waste moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 11, and I'm playing as the snake AI. The grid has walls and one internal obstacle. The snake's positions are given, and there are three food items with their positions, life spans, and values.\n\nLet me list out the key information:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are deadly. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n- **Snake Positions**: Head is at (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), and tail at (5,6). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is down, which means it was moving downward last turn.\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  1. Position: (3,2), Value: +1 (since it says value 1, and from rules, positive food is +1), Life Span: 3 turns. So it disappears after turn 13 (current turn 11, so life span decreases each turn including current; so after turn 11, 12, 13, it's gone on turn 14? Let me clarify life span.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N, and current turn is T, it will be available for N turns starting from now. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn T, countdown is N; turn T+1, it's N-1; ... turn T + N - 1, it's 1; then on turn T + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + N - 1.\n\nFor food at (3,2): life span 3, current turn 11. So available on turn 11, 12, 13. Disappears on turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,1): life span 6, available turns 11 to 16 (since 11 + 6 - 1 = 16, disappears on 17).\n\nFood at (2,6): life span 9, available turns 11 to 19 (11 + 9 - 1 = 19, disappears on 20).\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned, so that's good.\n\nSnake head direction is D (down). That means last move was down, so I cannot move up immediately because of no instant reverse. Current head position is (6,3), and it was moving down, so from (6,2) to (6,3)? Positions are given as [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. Head is (6,3), and direction is down. If it's moving down, y decreases? In grid coordinates, usually y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which is up if y increases upward, but typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? Let's see the movement definitions.\n\nU: (x,y+1) — so if y increases, U is upward.\n\nD: (x,y-1) — so y decreases downward.\n\nL: (x-1,y)\n\nR: (x+1,y)\n\nSnake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6). So from head to body: (6,3) to (6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6) to (5,6). So y-coordinates: 3,4,5,6,6. x from 6 to 5 at tail.\n\nSince head is at y=3 and next segment is at y=4, which is higher y, so if U is (x,y+1), higher y is up, so head at (6,3) with next at (6,4), which is one step up, but the direction is given as D, down? That seems inconsistent.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning last move was down. But from the positions, if head is at (6,3) and previous head was at (6,2) before moving down to (6,3)? Positions are current positions. Snake positions are listed head first, so at this turn, head is at (6,3), and it got there by moving down from, say, (6,2) on previous turn.\n\nBut the positions show body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So before moving, the head was at (6,2), moved down to (6,3), and the body followed.\n\nPrevious head position: since direction is down, and head is now at (6,3), it came from (6,4)? No.\n\nLet's think of the movement. On turn 10, snake was at positions: head at, say, P, then after move down, on turn 11, head at (6,3), and body segments shifted.\n\nThe positions list: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] — (6,3) is head, (6,4) is first body, which was head on previous turn, and so on.\n\nSo on previous turn (turn 10), head was at (6,4), and it moved down to (6,3)? But moving down to (6,3) from (6,4) would be decreasing y, so D: (x,y-1), from (6,4) to (6,3) is y-1, so down, yes. Then the new head is (6,3), and the old head (6,4) becomes body, and so on.\n\nTail was at (5,6) on turn 10, and it moved? When the snake moves, the tail moves forward only if no food is eaten; if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, since positions have 5 segments, and no food eaten this turn, I assume, as it's the start.\n\nBut point is, head direction D means last move was downward, from (6,4) to (6,3).\n\nNow, for the next move, I can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move up immediately. Possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But I have to consider walls and body.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent head position: (6,3)\n\nPossible moves from here:\n\n- U (up): (x,y+1) = (6,4) — but (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body, first segment. Is that a collision? Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail if it's moving away, but generally, moving into a body segment is deadly except for the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (6,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (5,6). So moving to (6,4) would collide with body, death.\n\n- D (down): (x,y-1) = (6,2). Now, is (6,2) within bounds? y=2, x=6. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, y=2 is between y=0 and y=7, but y=0 is wall, so y=2 is safe? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly x=0 or x=7. So (6,2) has x=6 (not 0 or 7), y=2 (not 0 or 7), so not a border wall. Also, no internal obstacle at (6,2), only at (3,6). So (6,2) is empty? We need to check if it's occupied by snake or food.\n\nSnake positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So (6,2) is not in the list, so not occupied by snake. Food: food at (3,2), (5,1), (2,6), not at (6,2). So (6,2) should be empty and safe to move to.\n\n- L (left): (x-1,y) = (5,3). x=5, y=3. Not border (x=5>0,<7; y=3>0,<7). Not internal obstacle. Snake positions: (5,6) is tail, but (5,3) not in list. Food not there. So should be safe.\n\n- R (right): (x+1,y) = (7,3). x=7, which is border wall. So moving to (7,3) is wall collision, death.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (6,2), L to (5,3). U to (6,4) is body collision, R to (7,3) wall collision.\n\nCannot move U because reverse and body.\n\nSo only two options: D or L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFood available:\n\n1. (3,2) - value +1, life span 3, available turns 11,12,13. Disappears turn 14.\n\n2. (5,1) - value +1, life span 6, available 11 to 16.\n\n3. (2,6) - value +1, life span 9, available 11 to 19.\n\nCurrent turn 11.\n\nSnake length 5.\n\nIf I eat food, length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). (0,0) bottom-left? Usually in coordinates, but movement U is y+1, so probably y=0 bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa? U (x,y+1) is up, so if y=0 is bottom, y+1 is up, y=7 top. Similarly D y-1 down.\n\nIn positions: snake at (6,3) head, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So y=3 to 6, with y=3 head, y=4,5,6 body, so y=6 is top? y=6, and walls y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is top wall, y=0 bottom wall. So y increases upward.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo (6,3): x=6, y=3.\n\nFood: (3,2) x=3,y=2; (5,1) x=5,y=1; (2,6) x=2,y=6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nNow, from head (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), then head at (6,2). Then on next turn, I can move from there.\n\nIf I move L to (5,3), head at (5,3).\n\nI need to consider paths to food and risks.\n\nFirst, food at (3,2) is close, at distance: from (6,3) to (3,2), delta x= -3, delta y= -1, so Manhattan distance 4. But with walls and body, not direct.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) from (6,3): delta x= -1, delta y= -2, distance 3.\n\n(2,6) from (6,3): delta x= -4, delta y= +3, distance 7.\n\nBut (3,2) has short life, only 3 turns including current, so I have to eat it by turn 13.\n\nTurn 11: I can act.\n\nIf I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because tail grows and head collides.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,6), and food is at (3,2), (5,1), (2,6), none at tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's think about moving D or L.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (6,2) on turn 11.\n\nThen head at (6,2). Now, from here, I can go to food at (5,1) or (3,2).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), from (6,2) I can move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1) or U to (6,3), but (6,3) is now body? After moving to (6,2), the new positions: head (6,2), then body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), and tail (5,6)? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position.\n\nCurrent positions turn 11: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nAfter move D to (6,2): head to (6,2), then segment 1 (was head) to (6,3) but it becomes body, segment 2 to (6,4), segment 3 to (6,5), segment 4 to (6,6), and tail: segment 4 was at (6,6), but the last segment was (5,6), which was tail.\n\nAfter move, the new body: position 1: (6,3) becomes body for segment that was head, but in the list, the new positions: head at (6,2), then the previous head position (6,3) is now the first body segment, previous (6,4) is second body, previous (6,5) third, previous (6,6) fourth, and the tail: previous tail was at (5,6), and since no food eaten, tail moves to where the second last was? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, the tail leaves its position.\n\nSo new tail position: the segment that was second last moves to where last was? Let's think.\n\nPositions: index 0: head, 1,2,3,4 tail.\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, then body[0] moves to where head was, body[1] moves to where body[0] was, etc., and tail (body[3]) moves to where body[2] was? Better to think the snake shifts: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo after moving down to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 1 (first body) moves to previous head position: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position: (6,5)\n\n- Segment 4 (tail) moves to previous segment 3 position: (6,6)\n\nPrevious segment 3 was at (6,5), so segment 4 moves to (6,6). But previous segment 4 was at (5,6), which is now empty.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nTail at (6,6).\n\nNow, from (6,2), I can move to food at (5,1) or (3,2).\n\n(5,1) is below and left, (3,2) is left and down.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,3) - but (6,3) is now body segment, collision.\n\n- D: (6,1) - y=1, not wall, not occupied? Snake: (6,2) head, (6,3), (6,4), etc, (6,1) not occupied. Food not there. Safe.\n\n- L: (5,2) - not wall, not occupied, safe.\n\n- R: (7,2) - x=7 wall, collision.\n\nSo can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf I move D to (6,1), then head at (6,1), and (5,1) is food adjacent: left of (6,1) is (5,1), which has food.\n\nSo on next turn, I could move L to (5,1) to eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf from (6,2) I move L to (5,2), then head to (5,2), and (3,2) is two left, (5,1) is down.\n\nBut let's think about the first choice.\n\nBack to turn 11, I have two choices: D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L to (5,3) on turn 11.\n\nMove L to (5,3): head to (5,3).\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then body: previous head (6,3) to (5,3)? No.\n\nPrevious positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nAfter move L to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to previous head position (6,3)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to previous segment 1 position (6,4)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to previous segment 2 position (6,5)\n\n- Segment 4 (tail): moves to previous segment 3 position (6,6)\n\nPrevious segment 3 was at (6,5), so segment 4 moves to (6,6).\n\nPrevious tail (5,6) is empty.\n\nNew positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nTail at (6,6).\n\nNow, from (5,3), I can move to food or explore.\n\nFood at (5,1) is below, at (5,1), which is down from (5,3)? From (5,3), D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\n(3,2) is left and down, from (5,3) L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then D to (3,2), but (3,2) has food, but need to be careful.\n\n(2,6) is up and left.\n\nNow, (5,1) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut (3,2) has short life, only until turn 13.\n\nTurn 11: if I move L to (5,3), then on turn 12 I need to move towards (3,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,4) - not occupied, not wall, safe? Snake positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). So (5,4) not occupied, no food, safe.\n\n- D: (5,2) - not occupied, safe.\n\n- L: (4,3) - not occupied, safe.\n\n- R: (6,3) - but (6,3) is body segment, collision.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I want to go to (3,2), I should move L to (4,3) or D to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (5,3), moving L to (4,3) gets closer in x, then from (4,3) I can move D to (4,2), then L to (3,2) or something.\n\n(4,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent; (3,2) is down-left from (4,3)? (4,3) to (3,2) is L and D, not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), then from (4,2) move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nOr from (4,3) move L to (3,3), then D to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3), if I move D to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can move L to (4,2), then L to (3,2), but (4,2) to (3,2) is adjacent.\n\nLet's see distances.\n\nBut I need to think about the internal obstacle at (3,6), but that's not near here.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, back to turn 11 choice.\n\nIf I move D to (6,2) on turn 11, then from there I can go to (5,1) or (3,2).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), from (6,2) I can move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I move D to (6,1), then (5,1) is adjacent left, so on turn 12 I can move L to (5,1) to eat it.\n\nThen snake grows, length 6.\n\nBut (3,2) might be missed if I do that, since it disappears on turn 13.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: from (6,2) move D to (6,1)\n\nThen (5,1) is left, so turn 13: move L to (5,1) to eat food.\n\nBut turn 13 is the last turn for (3,2), and (3,2) is at (3,2), which is far from (5,1), so I can't reach it on turn 13 from (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) on turn 12, I could move L to (5,1) on turn 12? From (6,2) on turn 11, after move, positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] as earlier.\n\nOn turn 12, from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2) or U to (6,3) but U to (6,3) is body, collision, or R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo move L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I move L to (5,2) on turn 12, then head to (5,2), and (3,2) is two left, (5,1) is down.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move L to (4,2) or D to (5,1) or U to (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,1) is food, so I can move D to (5,1) to eat on turn 12 or 13.\n\nBut (3,2) needs to be eaten by turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,2), to reach (3,2) on turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 12, if I move L to (4,2), then on turn 13 move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\n(4,2) to (3,2) is adjacent, so yes.\n\nIf I go to (5,1) first, I might miss (3,2).\n\nBut (5,1) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nPrioritize (3,2) since it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 11 I move L to (5,3), I can reach (3,2) by turn 13.\n\nFor example, turn 11: move L to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 12: move L to (4,3) or D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,3) move D to (4,2), then L to (3,2)? (4,2) to (3,2) is adjacent, but from (4,3) to (4,2) is D, then to (3,2) is L, but (3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,2) move L to (3,2) directly.\n\nFrom (5,2) move L to (4,2), then L to (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nSo in both cases, I can reach (3,2) by turn 13 if I start moving towards it.\n\nNow, what about the other food.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the tail reward danger, but no food at tail now.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body might block paths.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,2) or (5,3), the body positions change.\n\nLet's think about long-term.\n\nFood at (2,6) is at (2,6), which is top-left, and there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), which is nearby.\n\n(2,6) and (3,6) obstacle, so to reach (2,6), I need to go around.\n\nSince (2,6) has long life, I can get it later.\n\nFirst, I should go for (3,2) since it's urgent.\n\nThen (5,1), then (2,6).\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options on turn 11.\n\nOption A: Move D to (6,2)\n\nThen on turn 12, I can move L to (5,2) to head towards (3,2)\n\nThen on turn 13, move L to (4,2)\n\nThen on turn 14, move L to (3,2) to eat, but (3,2) disappears on turn 14? Life span: available turns 11,12,13, disappears on turn 14. So on turn 13, it is still there, but on turn 14 not.\n\nSo to eat on turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nFrom above: turn 11: at (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: at (5,2) if move L\n\nTurn 13: from (5,2) to (4,2) or to (3,2)? (5,2) to (3,2) not adjacent, distance 2 in x, same y, so need two moves: to (4,2) then to (3,2).\n\nBut on turn 13, if I move to (4,2), I can eat on turn 14, but food gone.\n\nOn turn 13, from (5,2), I can only reach (4,2) or (5,1) or (5,3), not (3,2) directly.\n\n(3,2) from (5,2) is |dx|=2, |dy|=0, so Manhattan distance 2, so I need to be at a neighbor on turn 12 to eat on turn 13.\n\nOn turn 12, I need to be at (4,2), (3,3), (3,1), or (2,2), but (2,2) might be far.\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,2): (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is left, (4,2) right, (3,3) up, (3,1) down.\n\nSo on turn 12, if I am at one of these, I can move to (3,2) on turn 13 to eat.\n\nIf I am at (5,2) on turn 12, I can move to (4,2) on turn 12? Turn 12 position.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 11: start at (6,3), move to new position.\n\nAfter turn 11 move, positions set.\n\nTurn 12: from new head position.\n\nIf on turn 11 I move D to (6,2), then turn 11 end: head (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: from (6,2), I can move to (5,2) or (6,1), etc.\n\nIf I move to (5,2) on turn 12, then I am at (5,2) on turn 12.\n\nFrom (5,2), on turn 13, I can move to (4,2), but (3,2) is not eaten yet, and I can move to (4,2) on turn 13, then on turn 14 to (3,2), but food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to be at an adjacent cell to (3,2) on turn 12.\n\nOn turn 12, from (6,2) after turn 11 move, where can I be?\n\nTurn 11 end: head at (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: from (6,2), move to (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) but (6,3) body, not possible.\n\n(6,3) is body, so only (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nNeither is adjacent to (3,2). (5,2) is at (5,2), (3,2) is at (3,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo from (6,2) on turn 12, I cannot reach a cell adjacent to (3,2) by turn 12; turn 12 I am at (5,2) or (6,1), both not adjacent to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 13, from (5,2) I can move to (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2), but I can only move to (3,2) on turn 14, when food is gone.\n\nSimilarly from (6,1), I can move to (5,1) or (6,0) but y=0 wall, or (7,1) wall, or (6,2) body, so only (5,1) if possible, but (5,1) is food, but not adjacent to (3,2).\n\nSo from turn 11 move D to (6,2), I cannot eat (3,2) by turn 13; the earliest I can be at (3,2) is turn 14, but it disappears on turn 14, so I miss it.\n\nTurn 14 it disappears, so on turn 13 it is there, but I can only move to it on turn 13 if I am adjacent on turn 12.\n\nBut from above, on turn 12, after moving D on turn 11, I am at (6,2), then move to (5,2) or (6,1), not adjacent to (3,2), so on turn 13 I move to say (4,2), then on turn 14 to (3,2), but turn 14 food not there.\n\nThus, I cannot eat (3,2) if I move D on turn 11.\n\nNow, if I move L on turn 11 to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 11 end: head at (5,3)\n\nTurn 12: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), or R to (6,3) but (6,3) body, collision, so U, D, or L.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2)\n\nFrom (5,3), if I move L to (4,3) on turn 12, then I am at (4,3) on turn 12.\n\n(4,3) is not adjacent to (3,2); (4,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,3), on turn 13, I can move D to (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2), then on turn 13 I can move to (3,2) to eat? On turn 13, from (4,2) move to (3,2).\n\nBut on turn 13, I need to be at (3,2) to eat.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTurn 12: from (5,3) move to (4,3) — head to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), or (5,3) but (5,3) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 12 move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body: previous head (5,3) becomes body, so (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), tail (6,6)? Previous positions turn 11 end: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nAfter move L to (4,3) on turn 12:\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: to (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: to (6,3)\n\n- Segment 3: to (6,4)\n\n- Segment 4: to (6,5)\n\n- Tail: to (6,6)? Segment 4 was at (6,6)? Turn 11 end positions: index 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Body 1: to previous head (5,3)\n\n- Body 2: to previous body1 (6,3)\n\n- Body 3: to previous body2 (6,4)\n\n- Tail: to previous body3 (6,5)\n\nPrevious body3 was (6,5), so tail moves to (6,5). Previous tail (6,6) empty.\n\nSo positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\nOn turn 13, from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), or (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision.\n\n(4,2) is down, (4,4) up, (3,3) left.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,3), moving to (4,2) or (3,3) gets me closer.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) on turn 13, then I am at (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2), so I can eat on turn 14 by moving L to (3,2), but turn 14 food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to move directly to (3,2) on turn 13 from a cell adjacent on turn 12.\n\nOn turn 12, after moving to (4,3), I am at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (3,2). Adjacent cells to (3,2) are (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2).\n\n(4,3) is not one of them; (4,3) is above (4,2).\n\nSo from (4,3) on turn 12, I cannot move to (3,2) directly; I need to go to (4,2) or (3,3) first.\n\nThen on turn 13, I can go to (3,2) from there.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) on turn 12, if I move to (4,2) on turn 13, then I can eat on turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 too late.\n\nIf on turn 12, from (5,3), I move directly to a cell that is adjacent to (3,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), can I move to (4,2) on turn 12? (4,2) is not adjacent to (5,3); (5,3) to (4,2) is not a direct move; moves are U/D/L/R, so from (5,3) to (4,2) would require diagonal, not possible. Only to (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), or (6,3).\n\nNone of these are adjacent to (3,2).\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to (3,2), but I can only reach (4,2) from (4,3) or (5,2) or (4,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\nFrom (5,3), the closest I can get on turn 12 is to (4,3) or (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to (3,2); (5,2) to (3,2) is two steps.\n\nSo from turn 11 move L to (5,3), on turn 12 I am at (5,2) or (4,3) or (5,4), none adjacent to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 13, from there I can move to a cell adjacent to (3,2), but not to (3,2) directly unless I am already adjacent.\n\nFor example, if on turn 12 I am at (5,2), I can move to (4,2) on turn 13, which is adjacent to (3,2), then on turn 14 to (3,2).\n\nAgain, turn 14 too late.\n\nIf on turn 12 I am at (4,3), move to (4,2) on turn 13, then turn 14 to (3,2).\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (3,2) by turn 13 from either initial move?\n\nBut that can't be right; let's think differently.\n\nTurn 11: current head at (6,3)\n\nI need to be at (3,2) on turn 13.\n\nThat's two moves away.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (3,2), Manhattan distance |6-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4, so in two moves, I can cover at most 2 steps, but 4>2, so impossible to reach in two moves.\n\nTurn 11,12,13: three moves including turn 11 action.\n\nTurn 11: move to new position at end of turn 11.\n\nTurn 12: move to new position.\n\nTurn 13: move to new position.\n\nSo from turn 11 start to turn 13 end, two full moves: turn 11 and turn 12 actions determine position at turn 13 start, then move to position at turn 13 end.\n\nPosition at turn 13 end is after the move of turn 13.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to move to (3,2) on turn 13 action.\n\nSo I need to be at a cell adjacent to (3,2) on turn 13 start.\n\nTurn 13 start position is after turn 12 move.\n\nSo I need to be at a neighbor of (3,2) on turn 12 end position.\n\nTurn 12 end position is after turn 12 move.\n\nTurn 12 move is from turn 11 end position.\n\nTurn 11 end position is after turn 11 move.\n\nSo from turn 11 start, after turn 11 move, I am at a position P11.\n\nFrom P11, after turn 12 move, I am at P12.\n\nP12 must be a neighbor of (3,2) so that on turn 13, I can move to (3,2).\n\nP11 is the position after turn 11 move.\n\nCurrent turn 11 start, head at (6,3).\n\nAfter turn 11 move, if I move to (6,2), P11 = (6,2)\n\nFrom (6,2), after turn 12 move, I can be at (5,2) or (6,1), neither is neighbor of (3,2). Neighbors are (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2). (5,2) is not neighbor, it's at distance.\n\nIf I move to (5,3) on turn 11, P11 = (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,3), after turn 12 move, I can be at (5,2), (5,4), or (4,3), none of which are neighbors of (3,2). (4,3) is close but not adjacent; (4,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent, as |dx|=1, |dy|=1, diagonal, not direct move, so not adjacent for grid movement; adjacent means share edge, so same x or same y with coordinate differ by 1.\n\n(4,3) and (3,2) differ in both, not adjacent.\n\nSo from both possible P11, I cannot reach a neighbor of (3,2) on P12.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (3,2) by turn 13; the best I can do is to be at a neighbor on turn 13 to eat on turn 14, but it disappears on turn 14, so I cannot eat it at all.\n\nLife span: available turns 11,12,13, so can be eaten on turn 13 if I move to it on turn 13.\n\nBut to move to it on turn 13, I need to be adjacent on turn 13 start.\n\nTurn 13 start is after turn 12 move.\n\nFrom turn 11 start, after two moves (turn 11 and 12), I am at P12.\n\nP12 needs to be adjacent to (3,2) for me to move to it on turn 13.\n\nBut from (6,3), in two moves, the farthest I can go is Manhattan distance 2.\n\n(6,3) to (3,2) is distance 4, so I can reach cells within distance 2, like (5,2), (4,3), etc, but not (4,2) or (3,3), which are distance 2.5 or something? (6,3) to (4,2): |6-4|=2, |3-2|=1, dist 3; to (3,3): |6-3|=3, |3-3|=0, dist 3; to (4,3): |6-4|=2, |3-3|=0, dist 2.\n\n(4,3) is at dist 2, which I can reach in two moves from (6,3).\n\nFor example, move L to (5,3) on turn 11, then L to (4,3) on turn 12, so P12 = (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is not adjacent to (3,2), as I said.\n\n(3,2) neighbors are (3,3), (3,1), (4,2), (2,2).\n\n(4,3) is not one of them.\n\nCan I reach (4,2) in two moves from (6,3)? (4,2) is at |6-4|=2, |3-2|=1, dist 3, so in two moves, I can reach dist 2 cells, like (5,2), (4,3), (6,1), etc.\n\n(5,2) is dist |1| in x, |1| in y, dist 2; (4,3) dist 2; (6,1) dist 2; none of which are neighbors of (3,2).\n\n(4,2) is dist 3, cannot reach in two moves.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) dist 3, cannot reach.\n\nSo indeed, from (6,3), in two moves, I cannot be at a cell adjacent to (3,2) on turn 12 end. Therefore, I cannot eat (3,2) on turn 13, and since it disappears on turn 14, I cannot eat it at all.\n\nSo the food at (3,2) is unattainable; I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nThat makes sense; I was struggling to find a way.\n\nSo for (3,2), life span 3, but from current position, I can't reach it in time, so it's not possible to eat. So I should not consider it.\n\nThen I have food at (5,1) and (2,6), both with longer life.\n\n(5,1) life span 6, available turns 11 to 16.\n\n(2,6) life span 9, available 11 to 19.\n\nNow, (5,1) is closer.\n\nFrom current head (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), then from there I can go down to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), so from (6,2) I can move L to (5,2), then D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (5,3) first, then D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\nBoth ways, I can reach (5,1) quickly.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (2,6), which is at (2,6), and there is an obstacle at (3,6), so I need to go around.\n\nBut since it has long life, I can go after (5,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about survival and space.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so space might be tight.\n\nCurrent grid: walls and obstacle.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might block paths.\n\nNow, let's consider the moves.\n\nFirst, on turn 11, I have to choose between D and L.\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), then positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) — tail at (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,2), I can move to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nIf I move to (5,2), then head (5,2), and (5,1) is below, so I can move D to (5,1) next turn to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (6,1), I can move L to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut moving to (6,1) might be closer to eating.\n\nIf I move L on turn 11 to (5,3), then positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2), then to (5,1).\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), the body is along x=6, y=2 to 6, so the right side is blocked.\n\nIf I move L to (5,3), body at (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so less blocking on the bottom.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (5,1), snake length 6, and I need to go to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at top-left, with obstacle at (3,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go to (2,6), which is adjacent to (3,6) obstacle? (2,6) and (3,6) are adjacent horizontally, but (3,6) is obstacle, so I can go to (2,6) from (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 wall, (1,6), or (3,6) obstacle, so only from (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(1,6) x=1, not wall, but x=0 wall, so (1,6) is valid.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) below.\n\nSo to approach (2,6), I can come from left or below.\n\nNow, after eating (5,1), where will the snake be?\n\nSuppose on turn 11 I move D to (6,2).\n\nTurn 11 end: head (6,2), body (6,3) to (6,6)\n\nTurn 12: move to (6,1) for example.\n\nMove D to (6,1): head to (6,1), body to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), tail to (6,6)? Previous positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nAfter move D to (6,1):\n\n- Head (6,1)\n\n- Body1: (6,2)\n\n- Body2: (6,3)\n\n- Body3: (6,4)\n\n- Body4: (6,5)\n\n- Tail: to (6,6) but previous body4 was (6,6)? Positions: index 0: (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (6,1)\n\n- Body1: to (6,2)\n\n- Body2: to (6,3)\n\n- Body3: to (6,4)\n\n- Body4: to (6,5)\n\n- Tail: to previous body4 position (6,6)? Body4 was at (6,6), so the new tail position is where body4 was, but when moving, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nStandard: the segment that was tail moves to the position of the segment that was before it, but since it's the end, it leaves.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then body segments: the first body is at previous head position (6,2), second body at previous body1 (6,3), third at previous body2 (6,4), fourth at previous body3 (6,5), and the tail (previous body4) moves to previous body3 position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter: the new body positions are the previous positions of the segments from head to tail-1.\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, each body segment i is at previous position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to len-1, and the tail is at previous position of the second last segment or something.\n\nList positions before move: P0 = head, P1, P2, P3, P4 tail.\n\nAfter move to new head position H:\n\n- New head: H\n\n- New body1: P0\n\n- New body2: P1\n\n- New body3: P2\n\n- New body4: P3  // since P3 was the second last, it becomes the new tail position? No.\n\nP4 was tail, so after move, the new tail is at the position where the segment before tail was, but the segments shift.\n\nNew positions: [H, P0, P1, P2, P3]  // P4 is left, and P3 becomes the new tail.\n\nIn this case, before turn 12 move: positions [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] so P0=(6,2), P1=(6,3), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,5), P4=(6,6)\n\nAfter move to (6,1): H = (6,1)\n\nNew positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) ]  // P0=(6,2) is new body1, P1=(6,3) new body2, P2=(6,4) new body3, P3=(6,5) new body4, and P4=(6,6) is no longer occupied, new tail at (6,5)\n\nNew tail at (6,5).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is left of (6,1), so adjacent.\n\nOn turn 13, I can move L to (5,1) to eat.\n\nThen snake grows, so new length 6, positions: after eating, head at (5,1), and the tail does not move, so positions: head (5,1), then previous body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and since ate food, tail stays, so add a new segment at the tail position before move or something.\n\nRule: when eat food, length increases, so the tail does not move; the new head is at food position, and the body includes all previous segments.\n\nBefore move to eat: positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] head (6,1)\n\nMove L to (5,1) to eat food at (5,1).\n\nNew positions: head at (5,1), then the previous positions: (6,1) becomes body, (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), and since food eaten, the tail segment is added at the previous tail position, so new segment at (6,5), but (6,5) is still there? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake gains a segment.\n\nAfter move, head at new position, and all body segments remain, with the tail not moving.\n\nSo positions: new head (5,1), then body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — and the previous tail was at (6,5), so it stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nStandard: when no eat, tail moves away. When eat, tail stays, so the new snake has head at new cell, and the body includes all previous cells, so length increases by one.\n\nSo previous positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] with head (6,1)\n\nAfter move to (5,1) and eat, new positions: head (5,1), then the previous head (6,1) becomes body, previous body1 (6,2), previous body2 (6,3), previous body3 (6,4), previous tail (6,5), and since ate, the tail position is kept, so new body4 at (6,5), but it was already there, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nThe new snake has the new head position, and all the previous segments, so positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) ] length 6.\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved differently.\n\nBut back to planning.\n\nSince (3,2) is not reachable, I should go for (5,1) first.\n\nThen to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is top-left.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is right of (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), I can come from (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) but y=7 wall, so (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(1,6) x=1, y=6.\n\nFrom current area, after eating (5,1), snake might be around (5,1) or (6,1), which is bottom-right.\n\nGrid is 8x8, (5,1) is near bottom.\n\n(2,6) top-left.\n\nSo I need to move left and up.\n\nBut there is the body and obstacle.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) has long life, so I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nNow, for turn 11, I need to choose move.\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), then I can go down to (6,1) and eat (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nIf I move L to (5,3), then I can go down to (5,2) then (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut moving to (5,3) might be better for long-term because it's more central or something.\n\nAfter eating (5,1) from (5,3) path, positions might be different.\n\nLet's simulate both.\n\nOption 1: Turn 11 move D to (6,2)\n\nPositions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1)  -- to go toward (5,1)\n\nPositions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]  // tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) to eat food at (5,1)\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)  // length 6, tail at (6,5)\n\nNow, from here, head at (5,1), I need to go to (2,6).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) but y=0 wall, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, collision.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\nMove U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nIf move U to (5,2), then from there, etc.\n\nBut (2,6) is far, I have until turn 19 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 11 I move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (5,3), positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nTurn 12: move D to (5,2)  -- toward (5,1)\n\nPositions: [(5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]  // after move, head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), tail at (6,5)?

After move, etc.\n\nThen I can go up from (4,1) to (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut there is the obstacle at (3,6), so to reach (2,6), I need to go to (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2.\n\nFrom bottom, I can go left to x=0, but x=0 wall, so to (1,1), then up to (1,2), ..., to (1,6), then to (2,6).\n\nOr from (4,1) to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then up.\n\nBut that might take many turns.\n\nSince (2,6) is at y=6, I can go up first.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), move U to (5,2), then to (5,3), but in the first scenario, (5,3) might be free or not.\n\nIn first scenario after eating, positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) so (5,2) and (5,3) are free.\n\nSo from (5,1) move U to (5,2), then U to (5,3), then L to (4,3), etc.\n\nThen to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but (4,6) is near the obstacle at (3,6), but (4,6) is free, then to (3,6) is obstacle, so I need to go to (3,5) or (4,7) wall, so down to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,6) up.\n\nSimilarly, from left.\n\nBut it's feasible.\n\nIn the second scenario, after moving L first and eating, positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] so (5,1) head, (5,2) body, (5,3) body, (6,3) body, etc.\n\nHere, (4,3) is free, etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in this case, the body is at (5,3) and (6,3), so (4,3) is free.\n\nFor turn 11, moving L to (5,3) might be better because it starts moving left earlier, which is toward (2,6).\n\nWhereas moving D to (6,2) keeps me on the right.\n\nSince (2,6) is left, moving left first might be better for long-term efficiency.\n\nAlso, there is no immediate danger.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but no food at tail.\n\nSo I think moving L to (5,3) on turn 11 is better.\n\nThen I can go down to eat (5,1) and then head left.\n\nPlan:\n\nTurn 11: move L to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (5,2) to go toward (5,1)\n\nTurn 13: move D to (5,1) to eat food at (5,1)\n\nNow, after that, head at (5,1), positions as above.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to (2,6).\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1), I can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2)\n\nSince (5,2) is body in this case? After eating, positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] so (5,2) is body, so I cannot move U to (5,2), collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,0) wall, R to (6,1) but (6,1) not occupied? In positions, (6,1) not there, so (6,1) is free? Positions are (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), so (4,1), (5,0) wall, (6,1), (6,2) are free.\n\n(6,1) is free, (6,2) free.\n\nBut moving to (6,1) might not help.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,2) but occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: (5,0) y=0 wall, collision\n\n- L: (4,1) - free, safe\n\n- R: (6,1) - free, safe\n\nSo can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1)\n\nSince I want to go left, move L to (4,1)\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current turn and possibly future, but the format is to output for turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t1: action\nTurn t1+1: action\n...\n}\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns; I think I need to provide a sequence, but since future depends on food and state, I should provide for the next few turns based on plan.\n\nSince I need to think ahead but output for the current state.\n\nFor this turn, I need to decide the action for turn 11.\n\nBased on above, moving L to (5,3) seems better for long-term.\n\nMoving D to (6,2) also works, but keeps me on the right.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,6) might be risky if the tail is there, but no.\n\nOr the internal obstacle.\n\nBut I think L is fine.\n\nSo for turn 11, I'll move L.\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan.\n\nBut the output should include multiple turns if possible.\n\nSince the state might change, I can output for t11 to t13 or something.\n\nLet's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 11: move L to (5,3)  // toward left and down for food\n\nTurn 12: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)  // down to approach (5,1)\n\nTurn 13: from (5,2), move D to (5,1) to eat (5,1)\n\nAfter that, on turn 14, from (5,1), move L to (4,1) to go left.\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (2,6), so better to go up soon.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2), then U to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied or not, depending.\n\nAfter turn 13, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (4,1) free, (4,2) free, (4,3) free, etc.\n\nSo turn 14: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 15: move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (4,3)\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), and so on, to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) from (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nBut (3,6) obstacle, so from (3,5) to (2,5) or (3,4) to (2,4), etc., to (2,5).\n\nThen to (2,6).\n\nSince (2,6) has long life, I have time.\n\nFor the answer, I can output for t11 to t13 or t14.\n\nBut since the food might change, I should output for the current turn and perhaps the next few.\n\nThe format doesn't specify, but I think for this, I'll output for t11 to t13.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 11: L\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nBut on turn 13, moving D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nNow, to confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), and I move L, which is left, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen from (5,3), moving D down, fine.\n\nFrom (5,2) moving D down to (5,1).\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I moved D on turn 11, it would be similar but different body positions.\n\nBut I think L is better.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the accessible positive food while avoiding risks. The food at (3,2) has a short life span (disappears after turn 13) but is unattainable by turn 13 due to the Manhattan distance from the starting position (6,3) being 4, which cannot be covered in the available moves (2 turns to reach an adjacent cell by turn 13). Thus, this food is ignored. The focus shifts to eating (5,1), which is closer and has a longer life span (available until turn 16), and then planning a path toward (2,6) for future consumption.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current Head Direction**: Down (D), so moving up (U) is not allowed on turn 11 (no instant reverse).\n- **Possible Moves on Turn 11**: From head position (6,3):\n  - Move D (down) to (6,2): Safe and open.\n  - Move L (left) to (5,3): Safe and open, starts moving left toward (2,6) for long-term efficiency.\n  - Move U (up) to (6,4): Occupied by body segment (6,4), collision risk.\n  - Move R (right) to (7,3): x=7 border wall, collision risk.\n- **Food Priority**: (5,1) is targeted first as it is reachable by turn 13. (2,6) has a long life span (available until turn 19) and will be pursued after eating (5,1).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No negative food or tail reward danger (no food under tail). The internal obstacle at (3,6) must be navigated around when approaching (2,6).\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turns 11-13**: Eat (5,1) efficiently by moving left then down. Moving left on turn 11 positions the snake better for long-term movement toward (2,6).\n  - **Turns 14+**: After eating, move left and up to navigate toward (2,6), avoiding the obstacle at (3,6) by going via (4,1), (4,2), etc. (detailed below).\n\n### Plan Execution (Turns 11-13):\n- **Turn 11 (Current Turn)**: Move L (left) to (5,3).  \n  - Reason: Avoids the body-packed right column (x=6), starts leftward movement for long-term pathing to (2,6), and positions for descending to (5,1). After move, positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n- **Turn 12**: Move D (down) to (5,2).  \n  - Reason: Continues toward (5,1) safely. (5,2) is open and reduces distance. After move, positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n- **Turn 13**: Move D (down) to (5,1) to eat the food.  \n  - Reason: (5,1) is reached and eaten, increasing length to 6. After move and growth, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\n### Long-Term Pathing (Beyond Turn 13):\n- **Goal**: Reach (2,6) by turn 19 (life span end). Path via left and up to avoid obstacle at (3,6):\n  - Turn 14: Move L (left) to (4,1) – open and starts leftward journey.\n  - Turn 15: Move U (up) to (4,2) – avoid bottom wall.\n  - Turn 16: Move U (up) to (4,3) – continue up.\n  - Turn 17: Move L (left) to (3,3) – navigate left.\n  - Turn 18: Move U (up) to (3,4) – approach top area.\n  - Turn 19: Move U (up) to (3,5), then L (left) to (2,5), and finally U (up) to (2,6) to eat (adjust based on exact position; this is high-level).\n- **Risk Management**: The body will shift, but the path avoids walls and uses open cells. If new food spawns, reevaluate.\n\nThis plan eats one food immediately, sets up for the second, and ensures survival by avoiding dead ends and collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: L (left)  \nTurn 12: D (down)  \nTurn 13: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). Walls are at the borders, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Since head is at (6,1) and direction is down, but (6,1) to (6,5) are all at x=6, y from 1 to 5. Head is at (6,1), which is the bottom if y increases upwards? Direction is given as U for (x,y+1), so U means increasing y, so up. Similarly, D means decreasing y, down.\n\nStandard coordinates: (x,y), with U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y). So y increases as we go up, decreases down.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]. Head at (6,1), which is low y, so near the bottom. Then (6,2) is above it, (6,3) above that, up to (6,5). So the snake is vertical, with head at the bottom, body going up. Direction is D, down. But if head is at (6,1) and moving down, down would be to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't move down. That can't be right.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D. D means (x,y-1), so decreasing y. From (6,1), moving down would be to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. But the snake must have moved to (6,1) from somewhere. Let's see the positions: snake is [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]. So the tail is at (6,5), which is high y. Since direction is D, down, that means the snake was moving down to (6,1). But (6,1) has y=1, which is above y=0, so from (6,2) to (6,1) is moving down, decreasing y.\n\nPositions are given head first: head at (6,1), then next segment (6,2), which means (6,2) is the first body segment behind the head. Since the snake moves, the head was previously at (6,2), I think, and moved to (6,1). Let's clarify snake movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if positions are [head, body1, body2, ..., tail], after moving, the head is at new position, body1 at old head, body2 at old body1, etc., tail at old second-to-last.\n\nHere, current positions: head: (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail: (6,5). Since direction is D, down, that means last move was from (6,2) to (6,1), so y decreased.\n\nNow, from (6,1), possible moves: since direction is D, down, I can't move up immediately because that would be reverse, but no instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U next. Possible moves: D, L, or R. But D to (6,0) is wall, y=0 is border, so D is invalid. L to (5,1), R to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so R invalid. x=7 is border wall, so (7,1) is invalid. So only possible moves are L to (5,1) or... D and R are walls, so only L is possible? But I can also move U, but U is opposite to D, and no instant reverse, so U is not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,1) is wall, since x=7 is border, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) is within bounds, x=5, y=1, which should be playable unless obstacle. Internal obstacle is at (3,6), not here. So L to (5,1) is possible.\n\nBut is there any other move? U is not allowed because reverse. So only possible move is L to (5,1)? But that seems dire.\n\nSnake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). After moving, if head moves to (5,1), then new positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) moves away, so (6,5) is now empty.\n\nBut (5,1) might have food or not, but I need to check food.\n\nFirst, let's list food:\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (5,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,6) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food have value 1, positive, since no negative food mentioned? Food list: (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Format: (x,y, value, life_span)? Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (3, 2, 1, 1) - (5, 1, 4, 1) - (2, 6, 7, 1) - (4, 1, 10, 1)\"\n\nIt says: (x,y, life_span, value)? No, it says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the list it's (x,y, something, something). Let's read: \"(3, 2, 1, 1)\" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", but the order might be ambiguous.\n\nFrom the core rules, in state input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \"\n\nIn the current state, it's written as: \" - (3, 2, 1, 1) \" etc., but it should be (x,y), value, life_span.\n\nLook: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 2, 1, 1)\" — it says \"Life Span and Value\" but then (x,y, first number, second number).\n\nIn the core rules, it's specified as: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so value first, then life_span.\n\nBut here it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" which might be misleading, but the list is (x,y, ?, ?)\n\nLook at the first one: (3,2,1,1) — since value is +1 for positive, and life span, (3,2) has life span 1? Or value 1?\n\nI think there's inconsistency. In the core rules section, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nThen in current state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 2, 1, 1) \" — it says \"Life Span and Value\" but the format might be the same.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo. Let's assume it's (x,y, value, life_span) as per core rules.\n\nCore rules say: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \"\n\nBut in current state, it's written as points with four numbers, so likely (x,y, value, life_span).\n\nFirst food: (3,2,1,1) — so x=3,y=2, value=1, life_span=1\n\nSecond: (5,1,4,1) — x=5,y=1, value=4? But all food should be value +1 or -1, but here value=4? That can't be.\n\nCore rules say positive food value +1, negative -1, but here it shows (5,1,4,1), which might be value=4, but that contradicts.\n\nPerhaps I misread. \" (5, 1, 4, 1) \" and it says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the text it's \"Life Span and Value\" for the current state.\n\nTo clarify, let's read the current state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 2, 1, 1) - (5, 1, 4, 1) - (2, 6, 7, 1) - (4, 1, 10, 1)\"\n\nAnd it says \"Life Span and Value\", so the third number might be life span, fourth is value? But value should be +1 or -1, but here all are 1, so positive.\n\n(3,2,1,1): if Life Span and Value, then life_span=1, value=1\n\nSimilarly, (5,1,4,1): life_span=4, value=1\n\n(2,6,7,1): life_span=7, value=1\n\n(4,1,10,1): life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll value=1, positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: (3,2) disappears after 1 turn, so at turn 14 it might disappear if not eaten, but since we are at turn 13, it has life span 1, meaning after this turn, it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, then each turn it decreases, when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases including current turn, then for food with life_span N, at turn t, if it has been there for some time, countdown is remaining turns.\n\nIn input, it's given as life_span, which is the remaining life, I think.\n\nFor example, (3,2,1,1): at turn 13, life_span=1, so after this turn (turn 13), the countdown decreases to 0, and it disappears before turn 14? Or at the end of turn 13?\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn T with life_span N. Then at turn T, countdown starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn T, countdown=N, turn T+1, countdown=N-1, ..., turn T+N-1, countdown=1, then at turn T+N, countdown=0, and it disappears.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is removed after N turns have passed, so at the beginning of turn T+N+1 it is gone, but countdown to 0 at turn T+N.\n\nTo simplify, with countdown including current turn, when countdown reaches 0, the food is removed.\n\nAt turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nFor this case, at turn 13:\n\n- Food at (3,2): life_span=1, so after this turn, it disappears. So if not eaten on turn 13, it's gone.\n\n- Food at (5,1): life_span=4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, i.e., at turn 17 or something.\n\n- Similarly, (2,6): life_span=7, disappear at turn 20\n\n- (4,1): life_span=10, disappear at turn 23\n\nNow, back to snake movement.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move U (opposite), D to (6,0) wall, R to (7,1) wall, so only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) has food! Food at (5,1) with value 1, life_span 4.\n\nSo if I move to (5,1), I eat the food, snake length increases by 1, so new length 6.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nFirst, after moving to (5,1), new positions: head (5,1), then body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail (6,5) moves away, so the body is at (6,1) to (6,4), and new tail is the old (6,4)? Positions: old head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5).\n\nAfter move L to (5,1): new head (5,1), then the first body segment is old head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail is (6,4)? No: the segments: new head (5,1), then the next segment is the previous head position (6,1), then the previous body1 (6,2), body2 (6,3), body3 (6,4), and the tail was (6,5), but since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment.\n\nWhen we eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and we add a new segment at the head.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and since you ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the old head position becomes the new body, and so on, up to the tail, which remains in place.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,1) which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then old head (6,1) becomes body, then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail (6,5) remains, so snake is now [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] — length 6.\n\nDirection: since we moved L, new direction is L.\n\nBut we are at turn 13, and I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nThe food at (5,1) is eaten, so it's gone.\n\nBut in the move, I have to move to (5,1), it's the only choice, right?\n\nBut let's confirm: from (6,1), with direction D, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,2), but (6,2) is currently occupied by the body, and it's not the tail, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body segment.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (6,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (6,2) would be collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,0) wall, death.\n\nR to (7,1) wall, death.\n\nL to (5,1), which is empty? (5,1) has food, but food can be eaten, so it's not an obstacle; the cell is free except for food, which is eaten when head moves there.\n\nSo only L to (5,1) is safe and possible.\n\nMoreover, (5,1) has food, so I get +1 score and grow.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nNow, possible moves from there.\n\nFirst, food at (3,2) has life_span 1, so if not eaten this turn (turn 13), it disappears, but I'm eating at (5,1), so (3,2) will disappear after this turn.\n\nAt turn 14, (3,2) is gone.\n\nOther food: (2,6), (4,1) with life_span 10, so plenty of time.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (5,1)? (5,1) to (4,1) is left, but direction is now L.\n\nLet's plan multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t=13.\n\nI must move to (5,1) since no choice.\n\nAction for turn 13: L (left to (5,1))\n\nNow, after this, at turn 14, head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nFood: (3,2) gone, (5,1) eaten, so remaining food: (2,6) and (4,1)\n\n(2,6) at (2,6), value 1, life_span 7 (since at turn 14, life_span decreases to 6? Let's keep track later.\n\n(4,1) at (4,1), value 1, life_span 10.\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction L (since last move left).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move R (opposite to L), so cannot go right to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body anyway.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,2): is this free? No walls, no obstacles? Internal obstacle at (3,6), not here. Check if occupied: snake body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc. (5,2) is not in positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,0): but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1): (4,1) has food! Food at (4,1).\n\nBut let's see if I can move there.\n\nL to (4,1): which has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nAlso, need to think long-term.\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), I eat the food, grow to length 7.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then old head (5,1) becomes body, then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) remains since ate.\n\nBut (4,1) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (6,5), which is not adjacent to (4,1). (4,1) to (6,5) is not adjacent, since |dx|=2, |dy|=4, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing edge, so neighbors: up, down, left, right.\n\nSo (4,1) neighbors: (4,2) U, (4,0) D (wall), (3,1) L, (5,1) R.\n\nTail at (6,5), which is far.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut after eating (4,1), I have to move from there.\n\nBut there might be better options.\n\nAt (5,1), I could move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nMoving D to (5,0) is invalid.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail (6,5) moves off? Since no food eaten, tail moves: the last segment (6,5) is removed, so new tail is (6,4).\n\nPositions: after move U to (5,2), head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Tail is (6,4), so length still 6? Original length 5, ate at turn 13, so now length 6.\n\nAt turn 13, after eating, length 6.\n\nThen at turn 14, if move U to (5,2), no food, so snake moves, head to (5,2), body segments move: new body at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail was (6,4) but since no eat, tail is removed, so new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Tail (6,3)? List:\n\nOld positions turn 13 end: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nMove U to (5,2): new head (5,2), then first body segment is old head (5,1), then old body1 (6,1), old body2 (6,2), old body3 (6,3), old body4 (6,4), and tail (6,5) is removed since no growth. So new positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]? Length 6, segments: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4) is the last, so tail at (6,4). (6,5) is gone.\n\nNow, from (5,2), direction U.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (4,1). If I don't eat it now, it's still there, life_span 10, so many turns.\n\nBut there is also food at (2,6), which is far.\n\nNow, the grid: walls at borders, obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) blocked.\n\nNow, snake is at (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) — so it's a bit messy.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nThe food at (4,1) is close, at (4,1), which is left of (5,1), but I'm at (5,2).\n\nIf I had moved to (4,1) at turn 14, I could eat it.\n\nBut let's see the options at turn 14 from (5,1).\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), eat food, grow to 7, positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) remains? Old tail was (6,5), but after turn 13, positions include (6,5), and when I eat at (4,1), tail stays, so new positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — all segments.\n\nThen from (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but cannot move R (opposite to L, since last move L).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1), R not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(4,2) might be free, (3,1) might be free.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nThere is food at (2,6), which is top-left, y=6 high.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently in the bottom-right area.\n\nTo survive long-term, I should not trap myself.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,1), I could go up or left.\n\nBut let's consider the other option at turn 14: moving U to (5,2) instead of L.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2), no eat, so positions as above: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,4).\n\nNow, from (5,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, cannot. L to (4,2), R to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, collision? (6,2) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so cannot move there.\n\nTail is at (6,4), so (6,2) is body.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,3), L to (4,2), or D but D to (5,1) is body, invalid, R to (6,2) body, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(5,3) and (4,2) should be free.\n\nIf I go U to (5,3), then I can continue up.\n\nBut food at (4,1) is still there, and I can go down later, but from (5,3) I might not be able to go down easily.\n\nLet's think about the area.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (3,6), so row y=6, x=3 blocked.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nNow, snake is long, 6 segments.\n\nTo eat (2,6), I need to go to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at top-left.\n\nFrom current, it's far.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is at bottom-left, but I'm at (5,1) or (5,2).\n\nBut at turn 13, I have to move to (5,1), no choice.\n\nThen at turn 14, I can choose to eat (4,1) or move up.\n\nIf I eat (4,1), I grow to 7, and I'm at (4,1).\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc., or left to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), so I need to go up to y=6.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (3,6), so to reach (2,6), I can go to (2,5) or (1,6) but x=1 is border? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are playable.\n\ny=1 to y=6.\n\n(2,6) is playable.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go left to (3,1), then to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), (2,3), etc. to (2,6).\n\nBut the snake body might be in the way.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up first from (4,1) to (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I have to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so paths might open.\n\nBut let's think about the immediate risk.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is gone after this turn, so no issue.\n\nNow, for long-term, eating (4,1) is good, but I might get trapped if I grow too much in a corner.\n\n(4,1) is corner-like, but not exactly, since I can go up or left.\n\nSimilarly, there is food at (2,6) which is another corner.\n\nBut life_span 7, so I have time.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 13: only move L to (5,1), eat food, score +1, length 6.\n\nNew state turn 14: head (5,1), direction L, positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nFood: (2,6) life_span 7 (at turn 14, life_span decreases to 6? Let's define life_span as remaining turns.\n\nAt turn 13, (2,6) has life_span 7, so at turn 14, it will have life_span 6, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) at turn 13 life_span 10, turn 14 life_span 9.\n\nBut (4,1) is still there.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I can:\n\nOption A: Move L to (4,1), eat food, grow to 7.\n\nOption B: Move U to (5,2), no eat, tail moves, length 6.\n\nLet's evaluate both.\n\nFirst, Option A: Move L to (4,1) at turn 14.\n\nEat food, new head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), length 7.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 15, head (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid, L to (3,1), R not allowed (opposite).\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), no food there, so move, tail moves: new head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) removed, so positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]? Length 7, after move no eat, tail removed, so new length 6? No.\n\nWhen no eat, the snake moves, head to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so length decreases by 1? No, length stays the same, but the tail moves forward.\n\nPositions: new head (3,1), then old head (4,1), old body1 (5,1), old body2 (6,1), old body3 (6,2), old body4 (6,3), and old body5 (6,4), and tail (6,5) removed. Since length was 7, after move no eat, new positions: head new, then the first 6 segments of old, so from old head to old second-to-last.\n\nOld positions: segments S0=head (4,1), S1=(5,1), S2=(6,1), S3=(6,2), S4=(6,3), S5=(6,4), S6=tail (6,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no eat: new head (3,1), then S0 becomes body (4,1), S1 becomes body (5,1), S2 body (6,1), S3 body (6,2), S4 body (6,3), S5 body (6,4), and S6 (6,5) is removed. So new positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] length 7? S5 is (6,4), which was body, now it's the tail.\n\nOld S5 is (6,4), which was the sixth segment, after move, it becomes the tail at (6,4).\n\nPositions: new head (3,1), new body1: old head (4,1), new body2: old body1 (5,1), new body3: old body2 (6,1), new body4: old body3 (6,2), new body5: old body4 (6,3), new tail: old body5 (6,4). Old body5 is S4? Indices: let's number from head.\n\nOld: S0: (4,1), S1: (5,1), S2: (6,1), S3: (6,2), S4: (6,3), S5: (6,4), S6: (6,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no eat: new S0: (3,1), new S1: old S0 (4,1), new S2: old S1 (5,1), new S3: old S2 (6,1), new S4: old S3 (6,2), new S5: old S4 (6,3), new S6: old S5 (6,4). Old S6 (6,5) removed.\n\nSo tail at (6,4).\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 15, if I move U to (4,2) instead.\n\nBut let's continue the path.\n\nIn Option A, after moving to (4,1) at turn 14, I can at turn 15 move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nSuppose I move U to (4,2) at turn 15.\n\nNo food, so move, tail moves.\n\nNew head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) removed, so tail at (6,4)? Similar to above.\n\nOld positions turn 14 end: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nMove U to (4,2): new head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) removed, so positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,3), (4,4), etc. up to (4,6), but (4,6) might be free, but obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is ok.\n\nBut (2,6) is food at (2,6).\n\nI can go left to (3,2), but (3,2) food was gone.\n\nOr to (2,6).\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nBack to turn 14 decision.\n\nOption B: at turn 14 from (5,1), move U to (5,2) instead of L to (4,1).\n\nThen no eat, positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) — tail at (6,4)? As earlier.\n\nOld tail (6,5) removed, so positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (5,2), turn 15, possible moves: U to (5,3), L to (4,2), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, R to (6,2) body, collision. So only U or L.\n\nIf U to (5,3), no food, move, tail moves: new head (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,4) removed, so positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut the food at (4,1) is still there, and I can go down to eat it, but from (5,3), to go to (4,1), it's not direct, and I might not be able to because of the body.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) or U to (5,4), etc., but to reach (4,1), I need to go down to (5,2) or (4,2), but (5,2) and (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn this path, at turn 15, if head at (5,3), positions include (5,2), (5,1), etc., so (4,2) might be free, but (5,1) is occupied, so from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), then to (4,2), then to (4,1) to eat, but when I move to (4,1), it might be possible if the tail has moved.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nIn the state after turn 15, positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nSo (4,1) is free, (4,2) free, etc.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) at turn 16, then to (4,2) at turn 17, then to (4,1) at turn 18 to eat.\n\nBut at turn 18, (4,1) food might still be there, life_span 10 at turn 13, so turn 14:9, turn15:8, turn16:7, turn17:6, turn18:5, so yes.\n\nBut that takes 3 turns to reach, and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nWhereas if I eat it now at turn 14, I get the score immediately.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I grow, but growing is not bad if I have space.\n\nThe grid is 6x6 minus obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, snake length 6, so plenty of space.\n\nAfter eating (4,1), length 7, still ok.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,6).\n\nFor example, from (4,1), move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2).\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), etc. to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has life_span 7 at turn 13, so turn 14:6, turn15:5, turn16:4, turn17:3, turn18:2, turn19:1, turn20:0 gone. So I have until turn 19 to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 14, if at (4,1), move L to (3,1) turn 15, then to (2,1) turn 16, then U to (2,2) turn 17, U to (2,3) turn 18, U to (2,4) turn 19, U to (2,5) turn 20, but (2,6) gone at turn 20? Life_span 7 at turn 13, disappears after 7 turns, so at turn 20 it is gone.\n\nAt turn 13, life_span 7, countdown decreases each turn including current, so turn 13:7, turn14:6, turn15:5, turn16:4, turn17:3, turn18:2, turn19:1, turn20:0 disappeared. So must eat by turn 19.\n\nAt turn 16 head at (2,1), then to (2,2) turn 17, (2,3) turn 18, (2,4) turn 19, then to eat (2,5)? (2,6) is at (2,6), so from (2,4) to (2,5) turn 20, but (2,6) gone, so too late.\n\nFrom (2,1) turn 16, I can go directly to (2,6) but not adjacent, so need multiple moves.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,6) is 5 steps up, but I have to move one per turn.\n\nAt turn 16 head at (2,1), then U to (2,2) turn 17, U to (2,3) turn 18, U to (2,4) turn 19, U to (2,5) turn 20, then (2,6) is gone, so I can't eat it if I start from (2,1) at turn 16.\n\nBut if I go faster, from current position.\n\nAt turn 14, if I am at (4,1) after eating, I can move U to (4,2) turn 15, then L to (3,2) turn 16, but (3,2) food gone, then to (3,3) or directly to (2,2) etc.\n\nTo reach (2,6), from (4,1), the shortest path is 3 moves left to (1,1) but x=1 min, so to (2,1) in 2 moves: (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1), then from (2,1) to (2,6) in 5 moves up, total 7 moves from turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: at (4,1), move to (3,1) turn 15, (2,1) turn 16, then (2,2) turn 17, (2,3) turn 18, (2,4) turn 19, (2,5) turn 20, (2,6) turn 21, but (2,6) gone at turn 20, so I miss it.\n\nIf from (4,1) I go up first to (4,2) turn 15, then to (4,3) turn 16, (4,4) turn 17, (4,5) turn 18, but (4,6) is available, then to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so to (2,6) from (4,5) I can go L to (3,5) then to (2,5) then to (2,6), but from (4,5) to (2,6) is not direct.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,6), 3 moves.\n\nAt turn 18, if at (4,5), move to (3,5) turn 19, (2,5) turn 20, (2,6) turn 21, too late.\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 14, I can move directly towards (2,6) but it's diagonal, not possible.\n\nThe fastest way to (2,6) is to go left and up, but with the body, it might be blocked.\n\nSince the tail is moving, some cells free up.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 14 position, with snake at bottom, it takes at least 5 moves to reach (2,6): e.g., (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (2,6) — 7 moves from (5,1), but from (5,1) to (2,1) is 3 moves left, then 5 up, total 8 moves.\n\n(5,1) to (4,1) one, (3,1) two, (2,1) three, then (2,2) four, (2,3) five, (2,4) six, (2,5) seven, (2,6) eight.\n\nTurn 14 start from (5,1), after move to (4,1) if I choose, but at turn 14 I am deciding from (5,1).\n\nAt turn 14, head at (5,1), I can move to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf I move to (4,1), I am closer to (2,6), at (4,1) turn 14 end.\n\nThen to (3,1) turn 15, (2,1) turn 16, then from (2,1) to (2,6) in 5 moves, turn 17 to 21, but (2,6) gone at turn 20, so at turn 20 I need to be at (2,6), but from (2,1) at turn 16, to (2,6) at turn 21, late.\n\nTurn 16 at (2,1), move U to (2,2) turn 17, (2,3) turn 18, (2,4) turn 19, (2,5) turn 20, (2,6) turn 21. But at turn 20, (2,6) disappears, so I can't eat on turn 20; last chance turn 19.\n\nTo eat on turn 19, I need to be at (2,6) on turn 19.\n\nFrom turn 14 at (5,1), I need to reach (2,6) in 5 moves: turns 14 to 18 moves, arrive turn 19.\n\nShortest path: Manhattan distance |5-2| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8, which is more than 5, impossible.\n\n|dx| =3, |dy| =5, min moves 8.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (2,6): dx=3 left, dy=5 up, so 8 moves required.\n\nTurns: turn 14 move, arrive new cell turn 14 end.\n\nTo be at (2,6) on turn t, I need to start moving from turn t.\n\nFor example, to be at (2,6) on turn 19, I need to move to it on turn 19.\n\nFrom turn 14 position (5,1), after turn 14 move, I am at new position.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1), I move to some cell, arrive there end of turn 14.\n\nThen turn 15 move, etc.\n\nTo reach (2,6) by turn 19, I have 5 moves: turns 14,15,16,17,18, arrive at (2,6) on turn 18 or 19?\n\nAfter turn 14 move, I am at new cell.\n\nAfter k moves, I am at the cell after k moves.\n\nTo be at (2,6) after m moves from turn 14.\n\nAfter 0 moves, turn 14 start, at (5,1)\n\nAfter 1 move, turn 14 end, at new position.\n\nAfter 2 moves, turn 15 end, etc.\n\nTo be at (2,6) after 5 moves, which is turn 18 end.\n\nTurn 14 move 1, turn 15 move 2, turn 16 move 3, turn 17 move 4, turn 18 move 5, so at turn 18 end, I am at the position after 5 moves.\n\n(2,6) life: at turn 13, life_span 7, so disappears at turn 13 + 7 = turn 20? Let's clarify disappearance.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" with N=life_span, and countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, food has life_span L, then at turn t, countdown L, after turn t, countdown L-1 for turn t+1, ..., when countdown 1 at turn t+L-1, after turn t+L-1, countdown 0, food disappears, so not available at turn t+L.\n\nFor (2,6) at turn 13, life_span 7, so:\n\n- Turn 13: available, countdown 7\n\n- Turn 14: available, countdown 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 19: available, countdown 1\n\n- Turn 20: countdown 0, disappeared, not available.\n\nSo can be eaten up to turn 19.\n\nTo eat on turn 19, I need to move to (2,6) on turn 19.\n\nFrom turn 14 start at (5,1), I need to reach (2,6) in 5 moves: turns 14,15,16,17,18 to move, arrive at (2,6) on turn 18 end, which is before turn 19, so on turn 19 I can eat if I am there, but I am already there at turn 18 end, so on turn 19 I move from there, but I need to move to it on turn 19.\n\nTo eat on turn t, I move to the food cell on turn t.\n\nSo for (2,6), I need to move to it on turn 19.\n\nFrom turn 14 start, I have moves on turn 14,15,16,17,18 to get to a cell from which I can move to (2,6) on turn 19.\n\nThe position at turn 18 end must be adjacent to (2,6), so that on turn 19 I can move to it.\n\nFor example, at turn 18 end, I need to be at (2,5), (2,7) invalid, (1,6), (3,6) obstacle, or (2,6) itself but not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,5), (1,6), (3,6) blocked, (2,7) wall, so only (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is x=1, y=6, which is playable, since walls at x=0.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,6) is top-left, playable.\n\n(2,5) is below (2,6).\n\nSo to eat on turn 19, I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,5) etc., but (3,5) is not adjacent to (2,6), only (2,5), (1,6), and (3,6) blocked.\n\nSo only (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,1), Manhattan distance to (2,5) is |5-2| + |1-5| = 3+4=7, or to (1,6) |5-1| + |1-6| =4+5=9, both more than 5, impossible to reach in 5 moves.\n\nMin moves to (2,5) is 7, to (1,6) is 9.\n\nSo from (5,1) at turn 14, I cannot reach a position to eat (2,6) on turn 19; it's too far.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the (2,6) food; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions, but with the snake size, it's not feasible.\n\nSo I should ignore (2,6) and focus on the available food, which is (4,1).\n\n(4,1) has life_span 10 at turn 13, so can be eaten up to turn 22, plenty of time.\n\nAnd it's close.\n\nSo back to turn 14 decision.\n\nAt turn 14, from (5,1), I should move L to (4,1) to eat the food, get the score, and grow.\n\nThen from there, I can explore the left side.\n\nAlso, by eating, I prevent the food from disappearing later, but since it has long life, not urgent, but why not eat it now for immediate reward.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it and move up, I might not be able to come back easily due to body.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,2), then the body is at (5,1), (6,1), etc., so to go to (4,1), I need to go left from (5,2) to (4,2), then down to (4,1), but (4,1) might be blocked or not.\n\nBut it's possible, but takes extra moves.\n\nWhereas eating now is efficient.\n\nAlso, no risk at (4,1).\n\nSo I think at turn 14, move L to (4,1).\n\nThen for later turns, I need to plan the path to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 13 and then for a few turns ahead, but the format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=13, so output actions for turn 13,14,15,16,17,18? 5 turns ahead would be up to turn 17 or 18.\n\nTurn 13 to turn 17 is 5 actions? Turn 13,14,15,16,17, that's 5 turns.\n\nTurn 13: action for turn 13\n\nTurn 14: action for turn 14\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 17 or more.\n\nBut I can output a sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 13: must move L to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 14: I decide to move L to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 15, from (4,1), direction L, I need to move, say U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nTo have space, I should go up to open area.\n\nSimilarly, there might be other food later, but only (2,6) which I can't reach, and no other food, so after eating (4,1), no food left, so I need to just survive and wait for new food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so only existing food.\n\nIn this state, only these food, and (2,6) will disappear, so after eating (4,1), no food, so I should avoid starvation, but the snake can survive by moving around without eating.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat available food.\n\nSince (2,6) is not reachable, I should eat (4,1).\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nTurn 13: L (to (5,1))\n\nThen turn 14: L (to (4,1), eat)\n\nNow at turn 15, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2), D invalid, L to (3,1), R not allowed.\n\nI can move U to (4,2) to go up.\n\nOr L to (3,1) to go left.\n\n(3,1) is free, no issue.\n\nSuppose I move U to (4,2) to avoid the corner.\n\nSo turn 15: U to (4,2)\n\nNo food, so move, tail moves.\n\nNew head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) — tail at (6,4)? Positions: old head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) — after move U to (4,2) no eat: new head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (6,5) removed, so positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] — tail at (6,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 16, from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision, L to (3,2), R to (5,2) — (5,2) might be free.\n\n(5,2) is not occupied, so free.\n\nSo can move U, L, or R.\n\nD to (4,1) body, invalid.\n\nIf move U to (4,3), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) had food but gone, so no food.\n\nI can move to open area.\n\nSay move U to (4,3) to continue up.\n\nTurn 16: U to (4,3)\n\nNo food, move, tail moves: new head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,4) removed, so positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 17, from (4,3), moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) body, L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nAll possible, no food.\n\nSay move U to (4,4).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the food (2,6) is not reachable, and no other food, after eating (4,1), I just need to move safely.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have turns 13 to, say, 17.\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L (to eat (4,1))\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), I said U to (4,2)\n\nBut at turn 15, from (4,1), direction L, I moved U.\n\nThen turn 16: from (4,2) U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 17: from (4,3) I can move U to (4,4) or other.\n\nTo be specific.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to be careful with no reverse.\n\nAt turn 15, after moving U from (4,1), direction is U.\n\nAt turn 16, from (4,2), direction U, I move U to (4,3), direction U.\n\nAt turn 17, from (4,3), direction U, I can move U to (4,4), or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3), not D.\n\nSay move U to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I think outputting up to turn 17 is fine.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: but in this case, no food under tail or anything.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, at turn 13, moving to (5,1) is fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nThen for turn 15, from (4,1) after turn 14, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I should output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 13,14,15,16,17.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 13: L (left)\n\nTurn 14: L (left to (4,1))\n\nTurn 15: U (up to (4,2))  // from (4,1) move up\n\nTurn 16: U (up to (4,3))  // from (4,2) move up\n\nTurn 17: U (up to (4,4))  // from (4,3) move up\n\nBut at turn 17, I might have choices, but this is safe.\n\nTo avoid staying in column, I could turn left or right, but not necessary.\n\nSince no food, moving up is fine.\n\nBut at (4,3), I could move left to (3,3) to explore, but no issue.\n\nI think the sequence is ok.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial move.\n\nAt turn 13, only possible move is L to (5,1), so must be L.\n\nThen at turn 14, from (5,1), moving L to (4,1) to eat is good.\n\nThen moving up.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 13):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,1), body at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail at (6,5).

Cannot be reached by turn 19 (last possible eat turn) due to distance (Manhattan distance 8 moves from (5,1), but only 5 moves available by turn 19). Ignore for efficiency.\n  - (4,1): Life_span 10 at turn 13; decreases to 9 at turn 14. Close and safe to eat.\n- **Possible Moves from (5,1)**:\n  - Down (D) to (5,0): Wall, invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (5,2): Valid, no food.\n  - Left (L) to (4,1): Valid, contains positive food (+1, life_span 9).\n  - Right (R): Opposite direction, invalid.\n- **Optimal Move on Turn 14**: L to (4,1) to eat food.

Opens space upward.\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Valid, no food. Moves toward left wall.\n  - Right (R): Opposite direction, invalid.\n- **Optimal Move on Turn 15**: U to (4,2).

No food eaten, tail moves; length remains 7.\n\n**After Turn 15 (Turn 16 Start):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (4,2), body at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (6,4).

Continues upward; no food, so prioritizes open space for survival.\n\n**Long-Term Considerations:**\n- **Food**: (2,6) is ignored as unreachable. No other food; focus shifts to survival and avoiding collisions.\n- **Survival Strategy**: After turn 17, snake can turn left/right (e.g., to (3,4) or (5,4)) to explore. Grid has space (35 cells, snake length 7), so low starvation risk. Avoid walls and body; tail moves free up cells.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No tail reward danger (no food under tail). Internal obstacle at (3,6) avoided by not moving directly there.\n\n**Action Sequence (5 Turns Ahead):**\n- Turn 13: Move L (to (5,1), eat food, +1 score).\n- Turn 14: Move L (to (4,1), eat food, +1 score).\n- Turn 15: Move U (to (4,2), no eat).\n- Turn 16: Move U (to (4,3), no eat).\n- Turn 17: Move U (to (4,4), no eat).\n\nThis sequence eats both accessible foods immediately, then moves upward to open space, ensuring survival for at least 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: L \\\\\nTurn 14: L \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) etc. are walls, so playable area is (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the grid is from 0 to 7 inclusive, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nThere's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). So that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (5,1) from (6,1), I assume.\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 7. Since it's turn 14, it will disappear after N turns, so life span decreases each turn. So at turn 14, life span is 7, meaning it will disappear after turn 14 + 7 - 1? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for food at (2,6): life_span=7 at turn 14. That means it will disappear after 7 more turns? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it means: when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t + L, it's gone. But countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, turn t+1 it's L-1, ..., turn t+L-1 it's 1, turn t+L it's 0 and disappears.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's see the countdown: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, at turn 14, food has life_span=7. So countdown starts at 7.\n\nAfter turn 14 is processed, countdown becomes 6, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, I think.\n\nBut let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's: at turn t, with countdown C, it decreases to C-1 at the end of the turn, and if C-1 == 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for simplicity, since we're planning moves, I can think that food is available only if life_span > 0 at the start of the turn.\n\nIn the state, it's given with life_span, so for decision making, at turn t, if life_span is S, it can be eaten in turns t to t+S-1, and disappears at turn t+S.\n\nSimilarly for the other food.\n\nFood at (2,6): value 1, life_span 7 at turn 14. So it will be available from turn 14 to turn 20, and disappear at turn 21 (since after 7 turns from 14 is 21).\n\nTurn 14: life_span 7, eaten or not, after turn, life_span becomes 6 for next state.\n\nBut for eating, as long as life_span > 0 when head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,1): value 1, life_span 9 at turn 14. So available until turn 14+9-1=22? Let's define.\n\nIf life_span at turn t is L, it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, inclusive, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (2,6): L=7 at t=14, can be eaten from t=14 to t=20, disappears at t=21.\n\nFor (4,1): L=9 at t=14, can be eaten from t=14 to t=22, disappears at t=23.\n\nBoth have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,1), direction left, so it came from right, meaning it was at (6,1) before and moved left to (5,1).\n\nCurrent positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nSo the body is: segment 0: head (5,1), segment 1: (6,1), segment 2: (6,2), segment 3: (6,3), segment 4: (6,4), segment 5: tail (6,5).\n\nSince head moved left to (5,1), the previous head was at (6,1) at turn 13, I assume.\n\nNow, possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nHead direction is L, so current direction is left.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nBecause moving right would be into the body segment at (6,1), which is directly adjacent, but let's see the positions.\n\nFrom head (5,1), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (5,2) - is this free? Let's list all cells.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is obstacle.\n\n(3,6) is occupied by wall? No, it's an internal obstacle, so not traversable.\n\nNow, snake occupies: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo cells occupied by snake: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nNow, head at (5,1), so possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,2)\n\n- Down: (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (4,1)\n\n- Right: (6,1) but (6,1) is occupied by body segment.\n\nNow, is (6,1) a body segment? Yes, it's the second segment.\n\nBut can I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail? In this case, if I move right to (6,1), which is currently occupied by segment 1.\n\nBut when I move, the tail also moves, so after move, the tail moves away.\n\nGeneral rule: moving into a cell that is occupied only by the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, so it doesn't collide.\n\nBut here, (6,1) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,5).\n\nSo (6,1) is a body segment, not tail. If I move right to (6,1), I would be colliding with my own body, which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, for any body segment except tail, it's a collision.\n\nBut tail is special: if head moves to current tail position, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, (6,1) is not tail; tail is (6,5).\n\nSo moving to (6,1) would cause collision with body.\n\nTherefore, from (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,2) - is this free? Currently, snake occupies (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (5,2) is not occupied by snake, and not wall? Walls are only borders and (3,6), so (5,2) should be free.\n\ny=2, x=5, not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so yes.\n\n- Down: (5,0) - y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (4,1) - x=4, y=1, not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake is at (5,1), (6,1), etc., so (4,1) should be free.\n\n- Right: (6,1) - occupied by body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move right because it's opposite direction? No, the no instant reverse is about direction, not about collision.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R, but even if I could, it's invalid because of collision.\n\nSo effectively, possible moves: U or L.\n\nD is wall, R is collision or invalid direction.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFood available: (2,6) and (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is adjacent to head (5,1) if I move left to (4,1).\n\nIf I move left to (4,1), I can eat the food there, since it's positive food.\n\n(4,1) has value 1, life_span 9, so can be eaten now.\n\nBut I need to consider the risks.\n\nAlso, there's (2,6) which is farther.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if I move left to (4,1).\n\nTurn 14: move to (4,1), eat food? Since (4,1) has food, and I move there, so I eat it.\n\nThen, snake grows by one segment, so new positions: head at (4,1), then the body: since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]? Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nIf I move left to (4,1), and since (4,1) has food, I eat it, so the snake grows: new head at (4,1), and the body: the previous head (5,1) becomes second segment, and so on, up to (6,5) which is tail, but since I ate, tail stays, so positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] with 7 segments.\n\nTail is at (6,5).\n\nNow, head direction: I moved left, so new direction is L.\n\nNow, after this, the food at (4,1) is consumed, so it's gone.\n\nNow, possible next moves from (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse: since direction L, cannot move R.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,2)\n\n- Down: (4,0) y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (3,1)\n\n- Right: (5,1) which is now body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n(5,1) is occupied by the second segment.\n\nTail is at (6,5), so (5,1) is not tail.\n\nSo cannot move right.\n\nThus possible: U or L.\n\nNow, (3,1) is free? Probably, but let's see the grid.\n\n(3,1) is not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (3,6)), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) free.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nBut I need to think about the other food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is far.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (4,1) now, I can move up or left, but left is towards (4,1).\n\nAt turn 14, if I move up instead of left.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2).\n\nThen, no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (5,2), then body: (5,1) becomes second, (6,1) becomes third, ..., tail (6,5) moves? When no food eaten, tail moves forward.\n\nOriginal positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nAfter move U to (5,2): head to (5,2), then the segments: previous head (5,1) is now second, (6,1) is third, (6,2) fourth, (6,3) fifth, (6,4) sixth, and tail (6,5) is removed? No.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (5,2), then body: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ] since tail was (6,5), it is removed, so the new tail is (6,4)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious segments: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2), new head at (5,2). Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,1). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (6,1). Segment 3 to where segment 2 was, (6,2). Segment 4 to where segment 3 was, (6,3). Segment 5 (tail) to where segment 4 was, (6,4). And the old tail position (6,5) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] with tail at (6,4).\n\nLength 6, same as before.\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nNow, from (5,2), I can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse: since direction U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,3)\n\n- Down: (5,1) but (5,1) is now occupied by body segment (second segment), so collision, invalid.\n\n- Left: (4,2)\n\n- Right: (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by third segment (in new positions: index 2 is (6,1)? New positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied by the fourth segment? Index: 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4) tail.\n\nSo (5,1) is segment 1, body; (6,1) segment 2, body; (6,2) segment 3, body; etc.\n\nFrom head (5,2):\n\n- Up: (5,3) - free?\n\n- Down: (5,1) - occupied by segment 1, collision\n\n- Left: (4,2) - free?\n\n- Right: (6,2) - occupied by segment 3, collision\n\nAlso, walls: (5,3) should be free, (4,2) free.\n\nSo possible moves: U or L.\n\nIf I move U, to (5,3); if L, to (4,2).\n\nNow, back to the decision at turn 14.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (4,1), eat food, grow to length 7.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U or L as above.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (5,2), no eat, same length.\n\nThen from (5,2), move U or L.\n\nI need to consider the food at (2,6). It's at (2,6), which is top-left, but y=6 is border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2, y=6.\n\nAlso, there's obstacle at (3,6), which is below (3,6)? y=6, x=3.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go to (2,6) or adjacent and move in.\n\nBut (2,6) has food, so I need to move head to it.\n\nNow, life_span 7 at turn 14, so I have until turn 20 to eat it.\n\nTurn 14 to 20, 7 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is nearby, but if I eat it now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver, or easier, depending.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,5) or after moves.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 14, tail is at (6,5), head at (5,1), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAfter moves, might be.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, but only 1-6 in x and y, with walls outside.\n\nCells:\n\nRow y=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (3,6) obstacle, so (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) free? (3,6) blocked.\n\nSimilarly other rows.\n\nBut snake occupies: at turn 14, (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo column x=6, y from 1 to 5 occupied.\n\nFood at (2,6) and (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is left of head (5,1).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), top-left.\n\nTo reach (2,6) from (5,1), I need to go left and up.\n\nIf I move left to (4,1) at turn 14, I eat and grow, then from there, I can go left to (3,1) or up to (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (3,1), then I can go to (2,1), etc, but (2,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go up to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut the snake body is on the right, so the left side is relatively free.\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,1) and move up to (5,2), then I can go left to (4,2) or up to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) food is there, and if I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or I can come back, but with life_span 9, it has many turns, so not urgent.\n\n(2,6) has life_span 7, so I need to eat it within 7 turns.\n\nTurn 14 to 20.\n\nNow, let's think about the path to (2,6).\n\nFrom current position (5,1) to (2,6): Manhattan distance |5-2| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8, so at least 8 moves, but with obstacles and body, it might take more.\n\nDirect path: left to (4,1), but (4,1) has food, if I eat, I grow, then from (4,1) to (2,6): |4-2| + |1-6| = 2+5=7 moves.\n\nBut with the body, it might be tight.\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,1), move to (5,2), then to (4,2) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's consider the risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is currently along the right wall, from y=1 to 5 at x=6, and head at (5,1).\n\nIf I eat at (4,1), I grow, and the body is at (5,1), (6,1), etc, so from (4,1), if I move up to (4,2), then I can go to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but (4,6) is free? y=6, x=4.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), so from (4,6) to (2,6), I need to go left, but there's obstacle at (3,6), so I cannot go directly left from (4,6) to (3,6) because (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSo to reach (2,6), I have to go to (2,5) or (1,6), but (1,6) is x=1,y=6, which is playable, since walls at x=0.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 playable.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to 6.\n\nSo (1,6) is free.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I can come from (2,5), (1,6), or (3,6) but (3,6) blocked, so only (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is below, (1,6) is left.\n\nNow, from current position, let's find a safe path to (2,6).\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate a few moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 14, I have two choices: L or U.\n\nIf I choose L, I eat food at (4,1), grow to 7, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen at turn 15, from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), then head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 16, from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body? After turn 14, positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nAfter move to (4,2), no eat, so snake moves: head to (4,2), then body: (4,1) becomes second, (5,1) third, (6,1) fourth, (6,2) fifth, (6,3) sixth, (6,4) seventh, and tail (6,5) moves to where previous segment 6 was, but segments: let's list.\n\nPrevious turn 14 positions: seg0: (4,1) head, seg1: (5,1), seg2: (6,1), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,3), seg5: (6,4), seg6: (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (4,2), no food, so new head at (4,2), then seg1 moves to seg0 position (4,1), seg2 to seg1 position (5,1), seg3 to seg2 position (6,1), seg4 to seg3 position (6,2), seg5 to seg4 position (6,3), seg6 to seg5 position (6,4), and old tail position (6,5) vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] with tail at (6,4).\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves at turn 15 from (4,2):\n\n- Up: (4,3)\n\n- Down: (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by segment 1, body, collision, invalid\n\n- Left: (3,2)\n\n- Right: (5,2) - free? Not occupied, so yes.\n\nBut no reverse: direction U, so cannot move D, but D is invalid anyway.\n\nCan move U, L, or R.\n\nR to (5,2) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) up, (3,2) left.\n\nIf at turn 15 I move L to (3,1) instead.\n\nFrom turn 14 head (4,1), move L to (3,1).\n\nIs (3,1) free? Yes, not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nNo food at (3,1), so no eat, snake moves: new head at (3,1), then body: seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (5,1), etc., up to seg6 to (6,4), tail moves to (6,4), old tail (6,5) vacated.\n\nPositions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse, direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U (3,2), D (3,0) wall invalid, L (2,1), R (4,1) occupied by body, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nNow, back to the food at (2,6).\n\nIf I want to reach (2,6), from (3,1), I can go up to (3,2), then (3,3), etc to (3,5), then to (2,5) or (4,5), but to (2,6) from (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is blocked, so from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) but blocked, so I have to go to (2,5) or (4,5), then to (2,6) or (4,6), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go left to (2,5), then up to (2,6).\n\nOr from (4,5) to (4,6), but (4,6) to (2,6) not direct.\n\nThe shortest way to (2,6) is to go to (2,5) first, then to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), moving up to (2,6) eats the food.\n\nNow, from current position, if I am at (4,1) at turn 14, then to (3,1) at turn 15, then to (2,1) at turn 16, then to (2,2) at turn 17, and so on to (2,5) at turn 20, then (2,6) at turn 21.\n\nBut (2,6) life-span: at turn 14, life-span 7, so available until turn 20 (turns 14 to 20 inclusive), disappears at turn 21.\n\nTurn 14: can be eaten\n\nTurn 15: life-span 6, can be eaten\n\n...\n\nTurn 20: life-span 1, can be eaten\n\nTurn 21: life-span 0, disappears.\n\nSo to eat at (2,6), I must be there on or before turn 20.\n\nIf I start from (4,1) at turn 14, to (2,6) in 6 moves: (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (2,6) — that's 7 moves to reach (2,6) from (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (2,6): |4-2| + |1-6| = 2+5=7 moves.\n\nAt turn 14, I am at (4,1) after move.\n\nTurn 14: move to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 15: move to say (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: to (2,1)\n\nTurn 17: to (2,2)\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: to (2,5)\n\nTurn 21: to (2,6) but at turn 21, food disappears, so I cannot eat it on turn 21.\n\nI need to be at (2,6) on turn 20 or earlier.\n\nFrom above, if I go directly left and up, I reach (2,1) at turn 16, then to (2,2) turn 17, (2,3) turn 18, (2,4) turn 19, (2,5) turn 20, and on turn 20 I am at (2,5), not at (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6) on turn 20, I need to be there at turn 20.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 20, I can move up to (2,6) on turn 21, but food gone.\n\nSo I need to reach (2,6) by turn 20.\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 14, after 6 moves, turn 20, I can be at (2,6) only if I move up faster.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) at turn 14, move up to (4,2) turn 15, then to (4,3) turn 16, to (4,4) turn 17, to (4,5) turn 18, then to (4,6) turn 19, but from (4,6) I cannot go directly to (2,6) because (3,6) blocked.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go left to (4,5) but that's back, or to (5,6), but not to (2,6) directly.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go to (2,5) or (1,6) first.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go up to (4,2) turn 15, then to (4,3) turn 16, to (4,4) turn 17, to (4,5) turn 18, then to (3,5) turn 19, then to (2,5) turn 20, then to (2,6) turn 21 too late.\n\nFrom (4,5) turn 18, I can go to (3,5) turn 19, but (3,5) to (2,5) or (3,6) blocked, so to (2,5) turn 20, then (2,6) turn 21 late.\n\nTo save a move, from (4,1) turn 14, move U to (4,2) turn 15, then L to (3,2) turn 16, then U to (3,3) turn 17, U to (3,4) turn 18, U to (3,5) turn 19, then from (3,5) I can go L to (2,5) turn 20, then to (2,6) turn 21 late.\n\nOr from (3,5) turn 19, I can go to (2,5) only, since (3,6) blocked, (4,5) down, but not up.\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) or (4,5) or (3,4), but to go to (2,6), I need to go to (2,5) first.\n\nThe only way to reach (2,6) faster is to go directly left from the beginning.\n\nAt turn 14, instead of moving to (4,1), I move U to (5,2).\n\nThen at (5,2), turn 14 position after move.\n\nThen I can move L to (4,2) or U to (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,2), if I move L to (4,2) turn 15, then I am at (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) turn 16, then to (4,4) turn 17, to (4,5) turn 18, to (4,6) turn 19, then to (4,5) or (5,6), not to (2,6).\n\nOr from (4,2) move L to (3,2) turn 15, then to (3,3) turn 16, to (3,4) turn 17, to (3,5) turn 18, then to (2,5) turn 19, then to (2,6) turn 20.\n\nThat might work.\n\nTurn 14: move U to (5,2) from initial.\n\nTurn 15: from (5,2) move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: from (4,2) move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4) move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nThen on turn 20, I am at (2,5), and food at (2,6) can be eaten on turn 20 if I move up, but turn 20 is the last turn to eat.\n\nOn turn 20, I am at (2,5), I can move up to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nYes, on turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: move to (2,6), eat food.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, in this path, I didn't eat the food at (4,1) at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, I moved U to (5,2) instead of L to (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 15, I moved L to (4,2), but (4,1) is still there with food, and I didn't eat it.\n\nBut in the path above, when I go to (4,2) at turn 15, (4,1) is below, but I don't go there, so the food is still available, and with life-span 9, it can be eaten later.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 14: U to (5,2)\n\nAfter move, positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nFood at (4,1) still there.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (4,2)\n\nNow, (4,2) has no food, so no eat, new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)? Previous positions: seg0 (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,2), new head (4,2), seg1 to (5,2), seg2 to (5,1), seg3 to (6,1), seg4 to (6,2), seg5 to (6,3), tail at (6,3), (6,4) vacated.\n\nNow, (4,1) is free and has food, but I didn't move to it.\n\nThen turn 16: from (4,2) move L to (3,2), no food there, positions update.\n\nAnd so on, as above.\n\nNow, at turn 20, I reach (2,5) and move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut I need to make sure that on turn 20, the food is still there.\n\nTurn 14: food (2,6) life-span 7, so on turn 20, life-span is 20-14+1? At turn 14, life-span=7, meaning after this turn, it decreases.\n\nBetter to think countdown.\n\nAt turn t, life-span S, countdown S.\n\nAfter turn t, if not eaten, countdown becomes S-1.\n\nWhen countdown 0, disappears.\n\nAt turn 14, S=7 for (2,6).\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, S=6 for turn 15.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 19, if not eaten, S=1 for turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 20, if eaten, ok; if not, S=0 and disappears.\n\nSo on turn 20, with S=1, it can be eaten.\n\nIf I move to (2,6) on turn 20, I eat it.\n\nIn the path, I do that.\n\nNow, what about the food at (4,1)? It has life-span 9 at turn 14, so on turn 20, S=9 - (20-14) = 9-6=3, still available.\n\nAfter turn 14, S=8 for turn 15? Let's:\n\nTurn 14: S=9\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, S=8 for turn 15\n\n...\n\nTurn 20: S=9 - (20-14) = 9-6=3? From turn 14 to turn 20, 6 turns later, so at start of turn 20, S = 9 - 6 = 3, yes.\n\nCan be eaten until turn 22.\n\nSo I can eat it later.\n\nIn the above path to (2,6), I didn't eat (4,1), so it's still there.\n\nAfter eating (2,6) at turn 20, I can go back to eat (4,1) if I want.\n\nBut now, back to turn 14 decision.\n\nIf I move L at turn 14 to eat (4,1), then I grow to length 7, and it might be harder to reach (2,6) in time because I have to go through more body or something.\n\nFor example, if I eat at turn 14, head at (4,1), then to reach (2,6) in 6 moves: but as before, I can only reach (2,5) by turn 20, missing the food.\n\nIf I go directly up from (4,1).\n\nTurn 14: move to (4,1), eat, grow to 7 segments.\n\nTurn 15: move U to (4,2), no eat, positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (4,3), etc., but to go to (2,6), I need to go left, but from (4,3) I can move L to (3,3) turn 16, then U to (3,4) turn 17, U to (3,5) turn 18, then L to (2,5) turn 19, then to (2,6) turn 20: on turn 20 move to (2,6), but at turn 19 I am at (2,5), turn 20 move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nWith growth, the snake is longer, but the path is similar.\n\nTurn 14: at (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: to (4,3) or to (3,3)? To save time, move left earlier.\n\nTurn 15 from (4,1): if I move L to (3,1) instead of U.\n\nTurn 14: to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: move L to (3,1), no food, so snake moves: new head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 16: from (3,1) move L to (2,1), no food, positions: head (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\nThen turn 17: move U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 18: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 21: to (2,6) but food gone.\n\nStill miss by one turn.\n\nIf I move up from (2,1) earlier, but from (2,1) I can only go U, D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1), R to (3,1) occupied, U to (2,2).\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I go U directly: turn 16 at (2,1), move U to (2,2) turn 17, U to (2,3) turn 18, U to (2,4) turn 19, U to (2,5) turn 20, then turn 21 to (2,6) late.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo if I eat at (4,1) on turn 14, I cannot reach (2,6) by turn 20; I arrive at (2,5) on turn 20, and food disappears before turn 21.\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,6) in time, I should not eat (4,1) at turn 14; instead, move up to (5,2), then proceed to reach (2,6) by turn 20 as in the earlier path.\n\nMoreover, by not eating now, I keep the snake shorter, which might be better for maneuvering.\n\nAlso, eating (4,1) now might block some paths or create dead ends, but in this case, not necessarily.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is good, but (2,6) has limited time, so I should prioritize that.\n\nNow, about the movement: in the path to (2,6), I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for several turns, at least 5+ turns ahead, I think.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and answer with actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns.\n\nIn the boxed answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 14: action\n\nTurn 15: action\n\n...\n\nUp to several turns.\n\nSince I need to plan to eat (2,6) by turn 20, I can plan the path.\n\nBut there might be risks or other considerations.\n\nFirst, at turn 14, I should move U to (5,2).\n\nThen from there, as per the path.\n\nNow, let's list the actions step by step.\n\nTurn 14: current head (5,1), move U to (5,2)\n\nAfter move, positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 15: from (5,2), possible moves: U (5,3), L (4,2), R (6,2) but (6,2) occupied by segment? Positions: seg0 (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,2) is seg3, body, so cannot move R.\n\nDown (5,1) occupied by seg1.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nI plan to move L to (4,2) to go towards left.\n\nMove L to (4,2)\n\nNo food at (4,2), so no eat, new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 16: from (4,2), possible moves: U (4,3), D (4,1), L (3,2), R (5,2)\n\nNow, (4,1) has food? (4,1) is a cell, and food is there, but is it occupied? Currently, in positions, (4,1) is not occupied; it's free.\n\nBut food is at (4,1), so if I move to (4,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut in our plan, we are going to (3,2) to reach (2,6).\n\nIf I move to (4,1), I eat the food, grow, but it might delay reaching (2,6).\n\nFor example, if I move D to (4,1) at turn 16, I eat, grow to length 7.\n\nThen from (4,1), I need to go to (3,1) or something, but it might take extra moves.\n\nTo reach (2,6) by turn 20, I should not detour.\n\nAt turn 16, from (4,2), if I move D to (4,1), I eat, but then I have to come back to (4,2) or go left, wasting moves.\n\nBetter to ignore (4,1) for now and go directly to (3,2).\n\nSo move L to (3,2)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail at (6,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2), possible moves: U (3,3), D (3,1), L (2,2), R (4,2)\n\n(4,2) occupied by segment1, body, so cannot move R.\n\nD to (3,1): free? Yes.\n\nL to (2,2): free.\n\nU to (3,3): free.\n\nI need to go up to reach y=6.\n\nMove U to (3,3)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4), move U to (3,5)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) tail at (5,2)? Previous: seg0 (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (5,1)\n\nAfter move to (3,5), new head (3,5), seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (3,2), seg4 to (4,2), seg5 to (5,2), tail at (5,2), (5,1) vacated.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,5), need to move to (2,5) to then go to (2,6).\n\nPossible moves: U (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nD (3,4) but down, occupied or not? (3,4) is seg1 position? Positions: seg0 (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (5,2) tail.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by seg1, body, so cannot move D.\n\nL (2,5) - free? Yes.\n\nR (4,5) - free? Probably.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nMove L to (2,5)\n\nNo food, positions: head (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, at turn 20, I am at (2,5), and food at (2,6) is still available (S=1 at turn 20).\n\nThen turn 21: move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nBut turn 21 is beyond our plan, but we need to do it.\n\nIn the action sequence, I need to include up to turn 20 or more.\n\nBut at turn 20, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), then turn 21 U to (2,6).\n\nBut turn 20 I am at (2,5), not eating yet.\n\nSince I need to eat on or before turn 20, but at turn 20 I can move directly to (2,6) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,5), (2,6) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, so I cannot move directly; I have to go to (2,5) or (1,6) first.\n\n(1,6) is left and up, but from (3,5) to (1,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,6) invalid, (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is adjacent, (4,5) adjacent, (3,4) down.\n\nSo no direct way to (2,6) from (3,5).\n\nI must go to (2,5) first, then to (2,6) on next turn.\n\nBut on turn 20, if I go to (2,5), I don't eat, then on turn 21 move to (2,6), but food disappears at turn 21, so on turn 21, when I move to (2,6), is the food still there?\n\nAt turn 20, food (2,6) has life-span: at turn 14, S=7.\n\nAfter turn 14, S=6 for turn 15\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 19, S=1 for turn 20\n\nAfter turn 20, if not eaten, S=0 and disappears, so for turn 21, it is gone.\n\nTherefore, on turn 21, (2,6) has no food; I cannot eat it.\n\nI must be on (2,6) on turn 20 to eat it.\n\nBut from positions, on turn 20, I need to be at (2,6).\n\nIn the path, at turn 19, I was at (3,5), then on turn 20, I need to be at (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is not adjacent to (3,5); it's (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) invalid.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent to (2,6)? (1,6) to (2,6) is right, adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (2,5) or to (4,5), but not to (1,6) or (2,6) directly.\n\n(1,6) is not adjacent to (3,5); it's two steps away.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,6) from (3,5) in one move.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 20 if I start from (5,2) at turn 14 with the path I have.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nTurn 14: start from (5,1) move to (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,5) can only go to (2,5) or (4,5), both not (2,6)\n\nThen on turn 20, I am at (2,5) or (4,5), not at (2,6).\n\nTo be at (2,6) on turn 20, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 19, like (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) invalid, or (3,6) invalid.\n\nSo (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nIn the path, on turn 19, I am at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6).\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is adjacent, but (2,5) to (2,6) is adjacent.\n\nBut on turn 19, I am at (3,5), not at (2,5).\n\nIf I can be at (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom turn 14: (5,1) to (5,2) turn 14\n\nTurn 15: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: to (2,2) instead of (3,3)\n\nTurn 17 from (3,2): move L to (2,2)\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 18: from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: U to (2,5) or U to (2,5) then to (2,6) on 21, but turn 20 I am at (2,5), not (2,6).\n\nTurn 19 at (2,4), turn 20 to (2,5), not (2,6).\n\nTo be at (2,6) on turn 20, on turn 19 I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nSo on turn 19, be at (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,4) on turn 19, move U to (2,5) on turn 20, but then on turn 20 I am at (2,5), not (2,6).\n\nI need to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nSo on turn 19, I must be at (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,6) invalid.\n\nSo (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nOn turn 19, I must be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nFor example, if on turn 18 I am at (2,4), then turn 19 to (2,5), turn 20 to (2,6).\n\nBut on turn 20 I move to (2,6) and eat.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 19 I am at (1,6), turn 20 move R to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSo in the path, I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6) on turn 19.\n\nNow, from current, can I reach (2,5) by turn 19?\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1) move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: to (2,2)\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3)  -- U from (2,2)\n\nTurn 19: to (2,4) -- U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 20: to (2,5)\n\nBut on turn 19 I am at (2,4), not (2,5).\n\nTurn 18 at (2,3), turn 19 to (2,4), turn 20 to (2,5), then turn 21 to (2,6) late.\n\nTo be at (2,5) on turn 19, I need to reach there earlier.\n\nTurn 14: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: to (2,2)\n\nTurn 18: to (2,3)  -- but (2,3) is not (2,5)\n\nFrom (2,2) turn 17, I can move U to (2,3) turn 18, but to go faster, I need to be at higher y.\n\nAt turn 16, I am at (3,2), instead of moving to (2,2), move U to (3,3) turn 17, then U to (3,4) turn 18, U to (3,5) turn 19, then turn 20 to (2,5), same as before.\n\nBut on turn 19 at (3,5), I can move to (2,5) on turn 20, but not to (2,6).\n\nThe only way to be at (2,6) on turn 20 is to be at (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nSo on turn 19, be at (2,5).\n\nFrom current position, turn 14 to turn 19, 5 moves.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (2,5): |5-2| + |1-5| = 3+4=7 moves, but in 5 moves? Turn 14 to turn 19 is 5 moves: turn 14,15,16,17,18,19? Turn 14 move to new position, so after turn 14, at new cell.\n\nAt start turn 14, head at (5,1).\n\nAfter turn 14 move, at new position for turn 15 start.\n\nAfter turn 19 move, at position for turn 20 start.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at the start of turn 20, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, to be at (2,6) on turn 20, move to it on turn 20.\n\nBut for eating on turn 20, I need to be at (2,6) after turn 20 move.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start of turn 19, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 18 or something.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the state is given, including positions.\n\nThen I choose action for turn t.\n\nAfter action, the snake moves, food eaten if applicable, etc.\n\nFor food at (2,6), it can be eaten when the head moves to it during a turn.\n\nSo for turn t, if at the end of move, head is at food position, and life-span >0, it is eaten.\n\nAt turn t, after move, if head on food, eat.\n\nAnd food is present if life-span at start of turn >0.\n\nFor (2,6), at turn 14, life-span 7, so can be eaten on turns 14 to 20.\n\nOn turn 20, if life-span at start >0, it can be eaten.\n\nAt start of turn 20, life-span for (2,6) is 1 (since 7 - (20-14) = 7-6=1), so can be eaten on turn 20.\n\nTo eat on turn 20, I need to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nSo I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,6) at the start of turn 20, so that I can move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,6): (2,5), (2,7) invalid, (1,6), (3,6) invalid.\n\nSo only (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nAt start of turn 20, I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 20, move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, at start of turn 19, I need to be at a position from which I can reach (2,5) or (1,6) in one move, but since I move on turn 19, after turn 19 move, I am at the position for turn 20 start.\n\nLet's define:\n\nAt start of turn t, positions are given.\n\nI choose action for turn t.\n\nAfter action, new positions: head moves to new cell, body follows, tail may move or not.\n\nThen, if new head position has food with life-span >0, it is eaten.\n\nSo for turn t, eating happens after the move.\n\nFor (2,6), to eat on turn 20, during turn 20 move, head moves to (2,6).\n\nAt start of turn 20, head is at some cell, and I move to (2,6).\n\nSo at start of turn 20, head must be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, to be at (2,5) at start of turn 20, I need to have moved to (2,5) on turn 19 or earlier.\n\nBut let's plan the position at each turn start.\n\nStart turn 14: head at (5,1)\n\nTurn 14: move U to (5,2)  -- now at (5,2)\n\nStart turn 15: head at (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: move L to (4,2)  -- now at (4,2)\n\nStart turn 16: head at (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: move L to (3,2)  -- now at (3,2)\n\nStart turn 17: head at (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)  -- now at (3,3)\n\nStart turn 18: head at (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)  -- now at (3,4)\n\nStart turn 19: head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5)  -- now at (3,5)\n\nStart turn 20: head at (3,5)\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or D to (3,4) but occupied, U invalid.\n\nSo move L to (2,5) on turn 20: now at (2,5)\n\nBut to eat (2,6), I need to be at (2,6) on a turn, so on turn 20 I am at (2,5), not eating.\n\nThen on turn 21, move U to (2,6), but food gone.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start of turn 20, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nSo on turn 19, from start position, move to (2,5).\n\nAt start turn 19, where am I?\n\nFrom above, at start turn 18, I am at (3,3) if I moved U on turn 17.\n\nLet's get to (2,5) by turn 19.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1) move U to (5,2)  -- at (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: move L to (4,2)  -- at (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: move L to (3,2)  -- at (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)  -- at (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)  -- at (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4) move U to (3,5)  -- at (3,5), not (2,5)\n\nTo reach (2,5) by turn 19, from (3,2) at turn 16, instead of moving U to (3,3), move L to (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nTurn 16: at (3,2), move L to (2,2)  -- at (2,2)\n\nStart turn 17: at (2,2)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (2,3)  -- at (2,3)\n\nStart turn 18: at (2,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,4)  -- at (2,4)\n\nStart turn 19: at (2,4)\n\nTurn 19: move U to (2,5)  -- at (2,5)\n\nStart turn 20: at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 20: move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nYes!\n\nAnd on turn 20, food is available.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the path is:\n\nTurn 14: U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 15: L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: L to (2,2)  // instead of U, to go left faster\n\nTurn 18: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: U to (2,5)  // on turn 19 to (2,5)? Turn 19 move to (2,5), so at start turn 20 at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 20 move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nIn the actions, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nFor turn 20, I move U to (2,6).\n\nNow, in this path, I didn't eat the food at (4,1), but it's still there with many turns left, so I can eat it later after turn 20.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 14 onwards for several turns.\n\nSince I thought 5+ turns, and to reach turn 20, I can output up to turn 20 or a bit more.\n\nBut at turn 14, I only have two choices, and I chose U.\n\nBut is there any risk in this path?\n\nFor example, when I move to (2,2) at turn 17, etc., the body might be there, but in this case, the body is trailing behind, so it should be fine.\n\nAt turn 17, after moving to (2,2), positions: from turn 16 start at (3,2), move L to (2,2), no eat, so new head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)? Previous: turn 16 start head at (3,2), after move to (2,2): head (2,2), then seg1 to (3,2), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (5,2), seg4 to (5,1), seg5 to (6,1), tail at (6,1), (6,2) vacated.\n\nAll cells free except snake, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger not applicable since tail is not near head.\n\nSo this seems safe.\n\nIf I had eaten at (4,1), I might not reach (2,6) in time, as before.\n\nTherefore, at turn 14, I should move U.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: L (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 16: L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: L (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 18: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 19: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 20: U (to (2,5)) but on turn 20 I move to (2,6)? No, on turn 20 I move from (2,5) to (2,6).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 19: at (2,4)? Let's list the actions and positions clearly.\n\nStart turn 14: head (5,1)\n\nAction turn 14: U, move to (5,2), no eat\n\nStart turn 15: head (5,2)\n\nAction turn 15: L, move to (4,2), no eat\n\nStart turn 16: head (4,2)\n\nAction turn 16: L, move to (3,2), no eat\n\nStart turn 17: head (3,2)\n\nAction turn 17: L, move to (2,2), no eat\n\nStart turn 18: head (2,2)\n\nAction turn 18: U, move to (2,3), no eat\n\nStart turn 19: head (2,3)\n\nAction turn 19: U, move to (2,4), no eat\n\nStart turn 20: head (2,4)\n\nAction turn 20: U, move to (2,5), no eat\n\nThen start turn 21: head (2,5), then move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 20, I am at (2,5), not eating (2,6).\n\nTo eat on turn 20, I need to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nSo at start turn 20, I must be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nIn the above, at start turn 20, I am at (2,4), then move U to (2,5) on turn 20, so at (2,5), not (2,6).\n\nMistake in turn count.\n\nFrom start turn 19: if at (2,3), action turn 19: U to (2,4), then start turn 20 at (2,4)\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start turn 20, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nSo on turn 19, from start at (2,3), move U to (2,4)? No.\n\nAt start turn 18, I need to be at (2,3) to move U to (2,4) on turn 18, then start turn 19 at (2,4), then move U to (2,5) on turn 19, start turn 20 at (2,5), then move U to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nLet's correct:\n\nTarget: at start turn 20, be at (2,5) or (1,6)\n\nThen action turn 20: move to (2,6)\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start turn 20, I must have moved to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nSo on turn 19, move to (2,5).\n\nAt start turn 19, I must be at (2,4) or (1,5) or (3,5), etc., to move to (2,5).\n\nSpecifically, adjacent to (2,5): (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,6) has food, but I can move to it later.\n\n(3,5) possible.\n\nSo for example, at start turn 19, be at (2,4) or (1,5) or (3,5)\n\nThen move to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nIn our path, at start turn 18, where am I?\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nTurn 14 action U: to (5,2) start t15\n\nTurn 15 L: to (4,2) start t16\n\nTurn 16 L: to (3,2) start t17\n\nTurn 17 L: to (2,2) start t18\n\nAt start turn 18: head (2,2)\n\nAction turn 18: U to (2,3)  -- now at (2,3) start t19\n\nStart turn 19: head (2,3)\n\nAction turn 19: U to (2,4)  -- now at (2,4) start t20\n\nStart turn 20: head (2,4)\n\nAction turn 20: U to (2,5)  -- now at (2,5) start t21\n\nThen on turn 21, move U to (2,6), but food gone.\n\nTo be at (2,4) at start turn 19, I need to move to (2,4) on turn 18.\n\nSo from start turn 18 at (2,2), move U to (2,3) on turn 18, start t19 at (2,3)\n\nNot (2,4).\n\nTo be at (2,4) at start t19, move to (2,4) on turn 18.\n\nFrom start t18 at (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), not directly to (2,4).\n\nI need to be at (2,3) at start t18 to move U to (2,4) on turn 18.\n\nStart t18 at (2,3), action U to (2,4) on turn 18, start t19 at (2,4)\n\nThen action turn 19: U to (2,5) on turn 19, start t20 at (2,5)\n\nThen action turn 20: U to (2,6) on turn 20, eat.\n\nSo how to be at (2,3) at start t18.\n\nFrom current, turn 14 to turn 18, 4 moves.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (2,3): |5-2| + |1-3| = 3+2=5 moves, so possible in 4 moves? Minimum 5 moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 14: U to (5,2) start t15\n\nTurn 15: L to (4,2) start t16\n\nTurn 16: L to (3,2) start t17\n\nTurn 17: U to (3,3) start t18 at (3,3)\n\nNot (2,3).\n\nTurn 17 from (3,2) move L to (2,2) start t18 at (2,2)\n\nThen to reach (2,3) at start t18, I need to be there at turn 17.\n\nIt's impossible to be at (2,3) at start turn 18 with the moves.\n\nStart turn 18 position is after turn 17 action.\n\nAfter turn 17 action, I am at the position for start t18.\n\nTo be at (2,3) at start t18, I must have moved to (2,3) on turn 17.\n\nOn turn 17, I move to (2,3).\n\nAt start turn 17, I must be at (2,2) or (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nIn the path, at start turn 17, I am at (3,2) or (2,2), etc.\n\nFor example, if at start t17 at (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2), not to (2,3) directly.\n\nSo I cannot be at (2,3) on turn 17 move.\n\nThe earliest I can be at (2,3) is on turn 18 move, as in the first path.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to reach (2,6) by turn 20 from the current position with the snake configuration, because the Manhattan distance is 8, and in 6 moves (turn 14 to turn 20, 6 actions), I can cover up to 6 steps, but since I start from (5,1), |dx|=3, |dy|=5, min moves 8, so in 6 moves I can only reach a cell with distance 6, but (2,6) has distance 8, so impossible to reach by turn 20.\n\nDistance from (5,1) to (2,6): Δx=3, Δy=5, so min moves 8.\n\nFrom turn 14 to turn 20, there are 6 actions: turn 14,15,16,17,18,19,20? Turn 14 action to move to new cell for t15, turn 15 to t16, ..., turn 20 action to move to new cell for t21.\n\nAfter turn 14 action, at position for t15 start.\n\nAfter turn 20 action, at position for t21 start.\n\nTo be at (2,6) after turn 20 action, I need to move to it on turn 20.\n\nThe move on turn 20 brings me to the cell.\n\nSo the position after turn k action is the state for turn k+1 start.\n\nTo be at (2,6) after turn 20 action, I need to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 14 to turn 20: 7 actions (turn 14 to turn 20 inclusive).\n\nTurn 14: 1st action\nTurn 15: 2nd\n...\nTurn 20: 7th action\n\nIn 7 moves, I can reach up to distance 7.\n\n(2,6) is distance 8 from (5,1): |5-2| + |1-6| = 3+5=8.\n\nSo with 7 moves, I can reach it, but only if I move directly without detour.\n\nFor example: from (5,1) turn 14 move L to (4,1) -- but if I eat, I grow, but position is (4,1)\n\nThen turn 15 move L to (3,1) -- at (3,1)\n\nTurn 16 move L to (2,1) -- at (2,1)\n\nTurn 17 move U to (2,2) -- at (2,2)\n\nTurn 18 move U to (2,3) -- at (2,3)\n\nTurn 19 move U to (2,4) -- at (2,4)\n\nTurn 20 move U to (2,5) -- at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 21 move U to (2,6) too late.\n\nFrom (2,1) turn 16, move U directly, but to (2,2), etc, same.\n\nOr from (4,1) turn 14, move U to (4,2) turn 15, then U to (4,3) turn 16, U to (4,4) turn 17, U to (4,5) turn 18, then from (4,5) I can move L to (3,5) turn 19, then L to (2,5) turn 20, at (2,5), not (2,6).\n\nStill not.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 19, move to (2,5) turn 20.\n\nNo way to be at (2,6) on turn 20 with 7 moves from (5,1) because min moves 8.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (2,6) because I cannot reach it within its life-span.\n\nLife-span 7 from turn 14, so must be eaten by turn 20, but I can only reach it on turn 21 at earliest, when it is gone.\n\nFor example, shortest path: (5,1) to (4,1) turn 14, (3,1) turn 15, (2,1) turn 16, (2,2) turn 17, (2,3) turn 18, (2,4) turn 19, (2,5) turn 20, (2,6) turn 21.\n\nTurn 21 too late.\n\nOr via up: (5,1) to (5,2) turn 14, (5,3) turn 15, (5,4) turn 16, (5,5) turn 17, (5,6) turn 18, then to (4,6) turn 19, then to (2,6) not direct, to (4,6) to (4,5) or (5,6) back, or to (4,6) to (3,6) blocked, so to (2,6) from (2,5) or (1,6), so from (5,6) to (4,6) turn 19, then to (4,5) or (5,6) not progress, or to (4,6) to (3,6) invalid, so must go to (4,5) first, etc, longer.\n\nSo impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 20.\n\nTherefore, the food at (2,6) cannot be eaten, so I should not prioritize it.\n\nI should eat the available food at (4,1) instead.\n\nAt turn 14, move L to (4,1) to eat it, grow, and then I can explore other areas.\n\nSince (2,6) is impossible, I can ignore it for now.\n\nThe other food at (4,1) has long life-span, so I can eat it now or later, but eating now gives immediate score and growth.\n\nThen I can move to safer areas.\n\nAt turn 14, move L to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can move U or L as before.\n\nTo avoid the body, I can move U to (4,2), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nOr move L to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut since (2,6) is not reachable, I can go towards the center or something.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), snake at [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] length 7.\n\nThen move U to (4,2), no eat, positions: head (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2), etc.\n\nThe grid has free space on the left and top.\n\nTo avoid being trapped, I can move towards (1,1) or something.\n\nBut with the internal obstacle at (3,6), it might affect, but not immediately.\n\nSince I have to output actions, I can plan a safe path for the next few turns.\n\nAt turn 14, move L to eat (4,1).\n\nThen for turn 15, from (4,1), move U to (4,2) for example.\n\nThen turn 16 from (4,2) move U to (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut to make it simple, since the food at (2,6) is not reachable, I should eat the available food.\n\nPerhaps I can check if there are other foods, but only two given.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 14: L (to eat (4,1))\n\nThen for the next turns, I need to provide actions.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, I can provide actions for turn 14 to turn 18 or so.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 15: move U to (4,2)  -- no eat, direction U\n\nTurn 16: move U to (4,3)  -- no eat, direction U\n\nTurn 17: move U to (4,4)  -- no eat, direction U\n\nTurn 18: move U to (4,5)  -- no eat, direction U\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,6) or left, etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is free, then I can go to (5,6) or (4,5), but to avoid dead end.\n\nBut for now, this is safe.\n\nI could go left earlier.\n\nBut for the purpose, this should be fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut I need to specify for 5+ turns, so up to turn 18 is 5 actions: turn 14 to 18.\n\nTurn 14,15,16,17,18: 5 turns.\n\nOr more.\n\nSince (2,6) is not reachable, and (4,1) is eaten, no other food, so I just need to survive.\n\nBut food might respawn or something, but not mentioned, so only these foods.\n\nSo after eating (4,1), no food, so I can move around.\n\nBut to be safe, moving up is fine.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with moving L at turn 14 to eat, then U for the next turns.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought U to avoid eating to reach (2,6), but since it's impossible, L is better to eat.\n\nAt turn 14, if I move U, I don't eat, but then I can eat (4,1) later, but it's still there.\n\nBut with move U, I am at (5,2), then I can move L to (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat, for example.\n\nBut D might not be possible due to direction.\n\nAt (4,2), if I move D to (4,1), I can eat the food.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince (2,6) is unattainable, eating (4,1) now is fine.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 14.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U (from (4,1) to (4,2))\n\nTurn 16: U ( to (4,3) )\n\nTurn 17: U ( to (4,4) )\n\nTurn 18: U ( to (4,5) )\n\nTurn 19: U ( to (4,6) ) but (4,6) is free, and no wall.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 18 or 19.\n\nSince the grid is small, I need to avoid colliding with tail or body.\n\nIn this path, it should be safe.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 14):**\n- **Grid:** 8x8, with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,6). Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6.\n- **Snake:** Positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]; head at (5,1), direction left (L). Length = 6.\n- **Food:**\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 20; can be eaten turns 14-20).\n  - (4,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 22; can be eaten turns 14-22).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- Movement: Cannot reverse direction instantly (current direction L, so cannot move R on turn 14).\n- Collisions: Deadly if head hits body (except tail) or wall. Tail is safe to move into if it moves away.\n- Food Mechanics: Positive food increases length by 1. Food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later. \"Tail Reward Danger\" not applicable here (head not adjacent to tail).\n- **Priority:** Maximize score by eating (2,6) if possible, but must eat by turn 20. However, Manhattan distance from (5,1) to (2,6) is |5-2| + |1-6| = 8. With 7 moves from turn 14 to turn 20 (turns 14-20 inclusive), it is impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 20 (minimum 8 moves required). Thus, (2,6) is unattainable and should be ignored.\n\n**Decision at Turn 14:**\n- Possible moves from (5,1): \n  - U (to (5,2)): Safe, no food.\n  - L (to (4,1)): Safe, eats positive food at (4,1), grows to length 7.\n  - D (to (5,0)): Wall, invalid.\n  - R (to (6,1)): Body collision (segment at (6,1)), invalid; also, reverse direction not allowed.\n- **Choice:** Move L to (4,1) to eat food immediately. This scores +1, increases length to 7, and secures the reward. (4,1) has a long life span, but eating now avoids missing it later and provides more space for future moves.\n\n**Long-Term Survival Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- After eating at (4,1), the snake is longer (7 segments), so prioritize open areas to avoid traps.\n- Current body positions (after turn 14) may block the right side (x=6, y=1-5), so move upward (U) to explore less constrained areas (left and top of grid).\n- Path for next turns: From (4,1), move U repeatedly toward y=6. This is safe and keeps options open:\n  - Avoids obstacles and body.\n  - After reaching (4,6), can turn left toward (1,6) or right, depending on future food/spawns.\n- **Risk Check:** No immediate collisions. \"Tail Reward Danger\" not a concern (tail not near head). Food at (2,6) expires on turn 21, so no benefit in attempting it.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 14-19):**\n- **Turn 14:** Move L to (4,1) – Eats food (+1), grows to length 7. New head direction: L.\n- **Turn 15:** Move U to (4,2) – No food, no grow. Head direction: U.\n- **Turn 16:** Move U to (4,3) – No food, no grow. Head direction: U.\n- **Turn 17:** Move U to (4,4) – No food, no grow. Head direction: U.\n- **Turn 18:** Move U to (4,5) – No food, no grow. Head direction: U.\n- **Turn 19:** Move U to (4,6) – No food, no grow. Head direction: U.\n\n**Why This Sequence?**\n- **Turns 15-19:** Moving U consistently avoids the body (concentrated on the right) and walls. The path is clear: (4,2) to (4,6) are all free cells (no walls, obstacles, or snake segments after moves).\n- **Survival Focus:** By turn 19, the snake is at (4,6), near the top row, with access to left/right movement. This maintains flexibility for future food or evasion.\n- **Food Consideration:** (4,1) is eaten; (2,6) is ignored (unreachable). No other food mentioned, so focus on safe navigation.\n- **5+ Turns Covered:** Sequence from turn 14 to 19 (6 turns) ensures long-term planning.\n\n**Future Considerations (Beyond Turn 19):**\n- At (4,6), possible moves: L to (3,6) (blocked by obstacle), R to (5,6), or D to (4,5). Move R to (5,6) or D based on state.\n- Monitor new food spawns (not provided, but possible in future turns).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: L \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6)\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to (4,2) from (4,1), I assume.\n\nFood:\n\n- At (2,6) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (3,1) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: For (2,6), life span 5, which means it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn. So after turn 16, it has 5 turns left? Let me clarify the life span countdown.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N more turns. So for (2,6), at turn 16, life span 5, so it will be there until turn 20, and disappear at turn 21? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it will have N-1 left. So it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nFor (2,6): at turn 16, life span 5, so:\n\n- After turn 16, countdown becomes 4\n\n- After turn 17, countdown 3\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 20, countdown 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 21 or something. I need to be precise.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for example, if a food has life span N at turn t, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n\nAt turn t, life span N means it has N turns left including the current one. So after N turns, it's gone.\n\nAt turn 16, life span 5 for (2,6), so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning it's gone at turn 21. Similarly, (3,1) has life span 10, so it disappears at turn 26.\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,2), direction Up. So from (4,1) it moved to (4,2) on this turn or previous? The position is given as of turn 16, I think. Snake positions are current positions.\n\nHead direction is Up, meaning it is facing Up, so it can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because of no instant reverse. Since it came from (4,1) which is down, moving Down would be reverse, so not allowed. Current head direction is Up, so possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nLet's list possible actions for this turn.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,3)\n\n- Left: to (3,2)\n\n- Right: to (5,2)\n\nDown: to (4,1) but (4,1) is the second segment, and since the snake is moving, the tail will move, so it might be possible to move to (4,1) if it's the tail, but let's see the snake positions.\n\nSnake: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nSo head at (4,2), then neck at (4,1), body at (5,1), etc., tail at (6,4).\n\nIf I move Down to (4,1), that is currently occupied by the neck segment. But when the snake moves, if I go to (4,1), which is where the neck is, but after moving, the neck will move to where the head was or something? I need to think about how snake movement works.\n\nStandard snake: when the head moves to a new cell, if it's not food, the tail moves forward, so the cell where the tail was becomes empty. If it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nBut here, if I move to a cell occupied by the body, it's a collision, except for the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, for food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nBut in this case, for possible moves:\n\n- Up to (4,3): what is at (4,3)? Not in snake positions, so empty? Or wall? Walls are at borders and (3,6).\n\n(4,3): x=4, y=3, not a border wall, and not (3,6), so should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, Left to (3,2): (3,2) not in snake, not wall, empty.\n\nRight to (5,2): (5,2) not in snake positions? Snake has (5,1), but not (5,2), so should be empty. (5,1) is a body segment, but (5,2) is different cell.\n\nDown to (4,1): (4,1) is the neck segment, second position. If I move there, it's a body collision, since it's not the tail. The tail is at (6,4).\n\nSo moving Down to (4,1) would cause collision with body, death.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: Up, Left, Right.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFood available: (2,6) and (3,1).\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, x=2, which is near the top, since y=7 is wall.\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1, near the bottom.\n\nSnake head at (4,2).\n\nAlso, internal wall at (3,6), but that's not near current position.\n\nI should consider the grid layout.\n\nGrid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nNow, snake positions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake is like: from (4,2) down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)? Let's plot:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are vertical, y increasing.\n\n(6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4), so going up.\n\nAnd from (4,1) to (5,1) right, then to (6,1) right, then up to (6,2), etc.\n\nHead at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nSo current head position (4,2), direction Up.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat positive food while avoiding risks.\n\nBut (2,6) has short life span, only 5 turns left, so it might disappear soon. At turn 16, life span 5, so after turn 16, it has 4 more turns? Let's clarify countdown.\n\nThe food is present at turn t with life span N, meaning it will disappear after N turns. So at turn t, it has N turns left including t.\n\nFor (2,6) at turn 16: life span 5, so it is present on turns 16,17,18,19,20. Disappears at turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 10, present from turn 16 to 25, disappears at turn 26.\n\nNow, turn 16: I need to choose action for turn 16.\n\nThen I need to plan for turn 17,18, etc., up to 5+ turns, so say turn 21.\n\nBut since I have to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I think I need to decide the sequence.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the sequence starting from turn 16.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to provide the actions for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's find a safe path to food.\n\nFood at (2,6) and (3,1).\n\n(2,6) is at top-left, (3,1) at bottom-left.\n\nSnake head at (4,2), which is middle-left.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies some cells, so I need to avoid colliding.\n\nMoreover, there's a risk with tail if I eat food near tail.\n\nBut currently, no food under tail or anything.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (3,1), which is closer in y-direction but same x? (3,1) vs head (4,2), so distance: |4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 Manhattan distance.\n\n(2,6): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6, farther.\n\nBut (2,6) has shorter life, so I might need to go for it soon or it disappears.\n\n(3,1) has longer life, so I can go later.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the grid has walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is near (2,6), but (2,6) is at (2,6), (3,6) is wall, so (2,6) is accessible, I think.\n\n(2,6) is not wall, not obstacle, so ok.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,2):\n\n- Up to (4,3): then from there, I can go to (4,4), (4,5), etc., towards (2,6) but (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, so I need to go left and up.\n\n- Left to (3,2): then I can go to (2,2), (1,2), etc., or up to (3,3), etc.\n\n- Right to (5,2): then to (5,3), (5,4), etc., but (2,6) is left, so right might not be good for that food.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is down and left from (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), to (3,1): I can go left to (3,2), then down to (3,1)? But (3,2) is a possible move, then from (3,2), down to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) has food, so if I go to (3,1), I eat it.\n\nBut let's see if that's safe.\n\nFirst, if I move Left to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen head at (3,2), and since no food eaten, the tail moves: tail was at (6,4), so it moves to (6,3) or something? When head moves, the body follows.\n\nAfter moving, if no food, the tail is removed, so new positions: head to new cell, each segment moves to previous position.\n\nSo if I move Left to (3,2) at turn 16:\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nThen body: the previous head position (4,2) becomes the new neck, so (3,2) head, then (4,2) which was head, now neck, then (4,1) which was neck, now body, then (5,1), then (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), and tail at (6,4) moves away, so (6,4) is empty now.\n\nList:\n\nPrevious positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)]\n\nAfter move Left to (3,2):\n\n- Head moves to (3,2)\n\n- Then segments: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,2)\n\n- Second body segment moves to previous first body position (4,1)\n\n- Third to (5,1)\n\n- Fourth to (6,1)\n\n- Fifth to (6,2)\n\n- Sixth to (6,3)\n\n- And tail at (6,4) is not part of snake anymore, so snake positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail is now at (6,3), which was previously (6,4) moved? No: the segment that was at (6,3) is now at (6,2), and (6,4) is gone.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then the segments follow the path: so (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3)\n\nSo tail at (6,3).\n\nNow, from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) if I go Down, but (3,1) has food.\n\nIf I move Down to (3,1) on turn 17.\n\nThen, since (3,1) has food, I eat it, so snake grows: head moves to (3,1), and tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — and since I ate food, length increases, so the tail stays, meaning I add a new segment, so positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nNow, tail is at (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) was the tail before, now it's not the tail anymore; the new tail is (6,2) or something.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at head, but in terms of positions, the head moves to food, and the body remains, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo from previous: before move, positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] with head at (3,2)\n\nMove Down to (3,1), which has food, so eat: head to (3,1), and the body stays, so new positions: head (3,1), then the previous segments: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — but since I ate, I add the new head position, and keep all body, so snake has 8 segments now.\n\nPositions: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction? After moving Down, direction is Down.\n\nNow, is this safe? I ate the food at (3,1), but now the snake is at (3,1), with body around.\n\nFrom here, I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1): Down not possible, since y=0 is wall, and (3,0) is out of bound, I assume walls are at y=0, so (3,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, Left to (2,1): possible, not wall.\n\nRight to (4,1): but (4,1) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nUp to (3,2): but (3,2) is the neck, second segment, so collision.\n\nSo from (3,1), after eating, I have no moves! All directions are blocked or body.\n\nDown: wall or out of bound, since y=0 is wall.\n\nLeft: (2,1), which is empty? Currently, no body or wall at (2,1), but in the positions, after eating, the body includes (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), etc.\n\n(2,1) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nBut let's see: positions are [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied, and not wall, so I can move Left to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, Right to (4,1): but (4,1) is in the body, it's the fourth segment, so if I move there, collision.\n\nUp to (3,2): (3,2) is the second segment, neck, collision.\n\nDown: to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move is Left to (2,1).\n\nSo after eating at (3,1), I must move Left to (2,1) to survive.\n\nBut that's on turn 18.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nTurn 16: move Left to (3,2) — head to (3,2), positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nDirection: after moving Left, direction is Left, I assume, since I moved left.\n\nHead direction changes to the move direction.\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2), move Down to (3,1) — eat food, so snake grows to 8 segments: positions [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead direction Down.\n\nNow, at turn 18, from (3,1), I can only move Left to (2,1), since other moves invalid.\n\nMove Left to (2,1): no food there, so tail moves: tail was at (6,3), so it moves, new positions: head to (2,1), then body: previous head (3,1) becomes neck, so (2,1) head, then (3,1), then (3,2), then (4,2), then (4,1), then (5,1), then (6,1), and (6,2) is now the last, since (6,3) gone? Segments: after move, head (2,1), then the segments: position that was (3,1) now moves to where head was? Standard: each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nAfter growth, positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] with head (3,1)\n\nMove Left to (2,1): no food, so tail moves off. Head moves to (2,1), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (3,1), second body to previous first body position (3,2), third to (4,2), fourth to (4,1), fifth to (5,1), sixth to (6,1), seventh to (6,2), and tail at (6,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction Left.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,1), Left to (1,1), Down to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, Up to (2,2), Right to (3,1) but (3,1) is neck, collision.\n\n(3,1) is the second segment, so moving Right to (3,1) would collide.\n\nUp to (2,2): not occupied, should be empty.\n\nLeft to (1,1): not occupied.\n\nDown invalid.\n\nSo possible: Left to (1,1) or Up to (2,2).\n\nIf I go Up to (2,2), I can then go towards (2,6) food.\n\nBut (2,6) has limited life.\n\nCurrent turn 18, (2,6) disappears at turn 21? At turn 16, life span 5, so present turns 16,17,18,19,20. Disappears at turn 21.\n\nSo at turn 18, it is still present.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go Up to (2,2), then to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut need to check if path is clear.\n\n(2,2) to (2,6) should be empty, I think.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,6), not affecting (2,6).\n\nAlso, snake body is at (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc., so (2,2) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), (2,4), etc.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (2,2) Up, then to (2,3) Up, etc., up to (2,6).\n\nBut at (2,6), I need to eat it.\n\nNow, when I eat at (2,6), what is the tail position? Need to avoid tail collision.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) might be under something? Currently not, but when I move there.\n\nBut in this path, if I go directly up from (2,1), I can reach (2,6) in 5 moves: to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6).\n\nFrom turn 18: at (2,1), move Up to (2,2) turn 18? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn 16: move Left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move Down to (3,1) eat food\n\nTurn 18: move Left to (2,1) or Up? From (2,1), I can move.\n\nAfter turn 17: positions [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] head (3,1)\n\nTurn 18: move Left to (2,1), no food, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (2,1), direction Left.\n\nTurn 19: from (2,1), move Up to (2,2) — possible, no food, so tail moves: head to (2,2), body: (2,1) neck, (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail at (6,2) moves to (6,1)? New positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 20: move Up to (2,3) — no food, positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (6,1) gone? Segments: after move, head (2,3), neck (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) and tail at (6,1) removed, so 8 segments? No, when no food, tail shortens.\n\nPrevious positions: before move, 8 segments: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]? Let's keep track of length.\n\nAt turn 17 after eating, snake length 8.\n\nTurn 18: move to (2,1), no food, so length 8, but tail moves, so positions: 8 segments but tail cell changes.\n\nAfter turn 18 move: positions [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] — 8 segments.\n\nTurn 19: move Up to (2,2), no food, so head to (2,2), then body: (2,1) moves to where? The segments shift: the segment that was at (2,1) moves to (2,2)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions before move: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2) tail\n\nMove head to (2,2): new head (2,2)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,1)\n\nSegment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (3,2)\n\nSegment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (4,2)\n\nSegment 5 moves to previous segment 4 position (4,1)\n\nSegment 6 moves to previous segment 5 position (5,1)\n\nSegment 7 moves to previous segment 6 position (6,1)\n\nAnd tail was segment 7, now at (6,1), but (6,2) is empty.\n\nNew positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 20: move Up to (2,3), no food, so head to (2,3), then body: segment 1 to (2,2), segment 2 to (2,1), segment 3 to (3,1), segment 4 to (3,2), segment 5 to (4,2), segment 6 to (4,1), segment 7 to (5,1), tail at (6,1) removed? Segment 7 was at (6,1), moves to (5,1), but (5,1) is now occupied by segment 7, and segment 6 was at (5,1), moves to (4,1), etc.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nMove head to (2,3): new head (2,3)\n\nThen segment 1 (which was at (2,1)? Indices: after turn 19, positions: head (2,2), body segments: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — so segment 1: (2,1), segment 2: (3,1), segment 3: (3,2), segment 4: (4,2), segment 5: (4,1), segment 6: (5,1), segment 7: (6,1)\n\nNow move: head to (2,3)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,2)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (2,1)\n\nSegment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (3,1)\n\nSegment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (3,2)\n\nSegment 5 moves to previous segment 4 position (4,2)\n\nSegment 6 moves to previous segment 5 position (4,1)\n\nSegment 7 moves to previous segment 6 position (5,1)\n\nAnd the tail position (6,1) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nTail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 21: move Up to (2,4), no food, positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (5,1) gone? Segment 7 moves to (4,1), etc.\n\nPositions before: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nMove to (2,4): head (2,4)\n\nSegment 1 to (2,3)\n\nSegment 2 to (2,2)\n\nSegment 3 to (2,1)\n\nSegment 4 to (3,1)\n\nSegment 5 to (3,2)\n\nSegment 6 to (4,2)\n\nSegment 7 to (4,1)\n\nNew positions: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 22: move Up to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,1) gone.\n\nSegment 7 to (4,2), etc.\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 23: move Up to (2,6), which has food, so eat: head to (2,6), grow, so positions: head (2,6), then the previous segments: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2) — and since eat, add new segment, so 9 segments: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nBut (2,6) food is eaten at turn 23, but at turn 16, life span 5, so it disappears after turn 20, meaning not present at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 16, life span 5, present turns 16,17,18,19,20. Disappears at turn 21, so not present on turn 21 or later.\n\nTurn 23 is after turn 20, so (2,6) food is gone by then.\n\nI cannot eat it at turn 23; it's not there.\n\nIn this path, at turn 20, I am at (2,3), and (2,6) is present until turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, I am at (2,3), and I can move to (2,4) on turn 20? Let's see the turn when I can reach.\n\nFrom turn 18: at (2,1)\n\nTurn 19: move to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: move to (2,3) — at turn 20, I am at (2,3), and (2,6) is still present, since present on turn 20.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move Up to (2,4) on turn 20? Turn 20 action is moving to (2,3), so at the start of turn 20, I am at (2,2) after turn 19 move.\n\nDefine the state at the start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn 16: head at (4,2), etc.\n\nAfter action on turn 16, I move to new position.\n\nSimilarly, food life span decreases after each turn.\n\nAt turn 16, (2,6) has life span 5, so after turn 16, it has 4 left, etc.\n\nBut it is present when the snake moves on that turn.\n\nOn turn t, when snake moves, if it moves to a food cell, it eats it if present.\n\nFor (2,6), it is present on turns 16 to 20 inclusive.\n\nOn turn 20, if I move to (2,6), I can eat it.\n\nIn the above, at turn 20, I am at (2,3) after moving on turn 20? No.\n\nStart of turn 20: after turn 19, I am at (2,2) for head? Let's list the head position at start of each turn.\n\nTurn 16 start: head (4,2)\n\nAfter turn 16 action: move to (3,2), so end of turn 16, head at (3,2)\n\nStart of turn 17: head at (3,2)\n\nAfter turn 17 action: move to (3,1), eat food, head at (3,1)\n\nStart of turn 18: head at (3,1)\n\nAfter turn 18 action: move to (2,1), head at (2,1)\n\nStart of turn 19: head at (2,1)\n\nAfter turn 19 action: move to (2,2), head at (2,2)\n\nStart of turn 20: head at (2,2)\n\nAfter turn 20 action: I can move to (2,3), but (2,3) has no food, or to (1,2) or (2,1) but (2,1) is body, or (3,2) body.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: Up to (2,3), Left to (1,2), Right to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, Down to (2,1) body, collision.\n\nSo only Up to (2,3) or Left to (1,2).\n\nIf I move Up to (2,3) on turn 20, head to (2,3), no food, so tail moves.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), I can move to (2,4) on turn 21, but turn 21, (2,6) is not present, disappeared.\n\nAt start of turn 20, head at (2,2), I can move to (2,3) on turn 20, but (2,3) is not food, and (2,6) is present, but I am at (2,3) after turn 20.\n\nOn turn 20, after moving, I am at (2,3), and (2,6) is still present, but I can't reach it in one move.\n\nOn turn 21, (2,6) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,6) if I go this way because I'm too slow.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 20, if I could move directly to (2,6), but I can't, only one cell per turn.\n\nSo this path to (3,1) first made me miss the (2,6) food.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (2,6) first, since it has short life.\n\nFrom turn 16, head at (4,2), instead of going left, go Up or Right to get closer to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), head at (4,2), so I need to go left and up.\n\nPossible moves: Up to (4,3), or Left to (3,2), or Right to (5,2).\n\nRight to (5,2) is away from (2,6), not good.\n\nLeft to (3,2) is closer, then I can go up.\n\nBut earlier when I went left, I ended up at (3,2) at turn 16 end.\n\nThen from (3,2), I could go Up to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (2,6) by turn 20.\n\nFrom (4,2) turn 16.\n\nIf I move Left to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen at (3,2), turn 17 start.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move Up to (3,3), or Left to (2,2), or Right to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision, or Down to (3,1) which has food, but if I go down, I eat (3,1) immediately, but then I might be stuck or miss (2,6).\n\nBut (3,1) has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nTo reach (2,6), better to go up.\n\nSo from (3,2), move Up to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nThen from (3,3), move Up to (3,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nThen to (3,6) but (3,6) is wall! Internal obstacle at (3,6), so I can't move there.\n\nOh, problem.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so from (3,5), I can't go to (3,6).\n\nI need to go to (2,6) from the left.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go Up first.\n\nTurn 16: move Up to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: head to (4,3), body: (4,2) neck, then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (6,4) gone? New positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction Up.\n\nTurn 17: from (4,3), move Up to (4,4) or Left to (3,3), or Right to (5,3), or Down to (4,2) but (4,2) is neck, collision.\n\nSo possible: Up, Left, Right.\n\nTo go to (2,6), I need to go left, so move Left to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nThen at (3,3), turn 18 start.\n\nFrom (3,3), move Left to (2,3) or Up to (3,4), etc.\n\nMove Left to (2,3) on turn 18.\n\nThen at (2,3), turn 19 start.\n\nFrom (2,3), move Up to (2,4) on turn 19.\n\nThen to (2,5) on turn 20.\n\nThen to (2,6) on turn 21, but turn 21, (2,6) not present.\n\nAt turn 20, I am at (2,5), and (2,6) is present on turn 20.\n\nStart of turn 20: head at (2,5) after turn 19 move.\n\nOn turn 20, I can move Up to (2,6) and eat it.\n\nYes!\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 16: move Up to (4,3) — head to (4,3), positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTurn 17: move Left to (3,3) — head to (3,3), no food, positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail at (6,3) gone? New: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nTurn 18: move Left to (2,3) — head to (2,3), no food, positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,2) gone? New: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nTurn 19: move Up to (2,4) — head to (2,4), no food, positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (6,1) gone? New: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nTail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 20: move Up to (2,5) — head to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (5,1) gone? New: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nStart of turn 21: head at (2,5), but (2,6) disappears at turn 21, so on turn 21, it is not present.\n\nAt start of turn 20, head at (2,4) after turn 19.\n\nOn turn 20, I move to (2,5), but (2,5) is not food, and (2,6) is at (2,6), I need to move to (2,6) on turn 20 to eat it.\n\nBut from (2,4) at start turn 20, I can move Up to (2,5) or to (2,6)? No, only adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move to (2,5), (1,4), or (3,4), or (2,3) but (2,3) is body.\n\n(2,5) is empty, I assume.\n\nBut (2,5) is not food; food is at (2,6).\n\nSo on turn 20, I move to (2,5), not eating food.\n\nThen on turn 21, I can move to (2,6), but (2,6) is gone.\n\nSo I missed it by one turn.\n\nTo eat on turn 20, I need to be at (2,5) at start of turn 20 and move to (2,6).\n\nBut at start of turn 20, if I am at (2,5), then move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nHow to be at (2,5) at turn 20 start.\n\nTurn 20 start is after turn 19 action.\n\nSo need to reach (2,5) by turn 19 action.\n\nTurn 19 action: from where?\n\nLet's go faster.\n\nFrom turn 16: at (4,2), move Left to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,2), move Up to (3,3) or directly to (2,2)? From (3,2), move Left to (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nThen at (2,2), turn 18 start.\n\nMove Up to (2,3) on turn 18.\n\nMove Up to (2,4) on turn 19.\n\nMove Up to (2,5) on turn 20? But on turn 20, move to (2,5), then at start turn 21, at (2,5), move to (2,6) but gone.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 18 start, move Up to (2,3) turn 18.\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), move Up to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: from (2,4), move Up to (2,5)\n\nStill at (2,5) on turn 20 end.\n\nNot at (2,6).\n\nThe only way to eat on turn 20 is to be at (2,5) at start turn 20 and move to (2,6).\n\nSo I need to be at (2,5) at turn 20 start.\n\nThat means after turn 19 action, head at (2,5).\n\nTurn 19 action: from where at turn 19 start.\n\nTurn 19 start is after turn 18 action.\n\nSo need to reach (2,5) by turn 18 action? Turn 18 action moves to a cell.\n\nIf on turn 18, I move to (2,5), then at turn 18 end, head at (2,5), so start turn 19 at (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 19, I can move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut turn 19 is before turn 20, so (2,6) is still present.\n\nTurn 19: if I move to (2,6), I eat it on turn 19.\n\nYes, turn 19 is within the life span.\n\nPresent turns 16 to 20, so turn 19 is ok.\n\nSo if I can be at a cell adjacent to (2,6) by turn 19 start, then move to it on turn 19.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,6): (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, (1,6), (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, so only (2,5) and (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is the only accessible adjacent cell.\n\nSo I need to be at (2,5) at start of turn 19 to move to (2,6) on turn 19.\n\nAt start of turn 19, head at (2,5).\n\nHow to get to (2,5) by turn 18 action.\n\nTurn 18 action: move to (2,5).\n\nFrom where at turn 18 start?\n\nTurn 18 start is after turn 17 action.\n\nSo at turn 17 action, I need to move to a cell adjacent to (2,5), so that from there, I can move to (2,5) on turn 18.\n\nAdjacent to (2,5): (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is the food, but I can move to it later.\n\n(2,4), (1,5), (3,5) are possible.\n\nBut I need to be at one of these at turn 17 start to move to (2,5) on turn 18? No.\n\nAt turn 17 start, head position.\n\nAfter turn 17 action, head at new position, which is start of turn 18.\n\nIf on turn 17, I move to (2,4), for example, then at start turn 18, at (2,4), then on turn 18, I move to (2,5), then at start turn 19, at (2,5), then on turn 19, move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 17 I move to (1,5) or (3,5), then to (2,5) on turn 18.\n\nBut (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nNow, from current position, can I reach (2,4) or (1,5) or (3,5) by turn 17.\n\nTurn 17 action: move to one of those.\n\nBut turn 17 action depends on where I am at turn 17 start.\n\nTurn 17 start is after turn 16 action.\n\nSo at turn 16, I move from (4,2) to some place.\n\nSuppose on turn 16, I move to (3,2) as before.\n\nThen at start turn 17, at (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (3,3), (2,2), (3,1), etc.\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to (2,3), but not directly to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,2), if I move to (2,2) on turn 17, then at start turn 18, at (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 18, move to (2,3), then at start turn 19, at (2,3), not (2,5).\n\nToo slow.\n\nFrom (3,2), move Up to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nThen at (3,3), start turn 18.\n\nThen on turn 18, move to (3,4) or to (2,3), etc.\n\nNot to (2,5).\n\nI can move directly towards (2,5) but it's multiple steps.\n\nThe shortest path from (4,2) to (2,5) is 3 steps: e.g., Left to (3,2), then Left to (2,2), then Up to (2,3), then Up to (2,4), then Up to (2,5), that's 4 steps from (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,5): delta x= -2, delta y= +3, so min 5 moves? Manhattan distance |4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5 cells, so 5 moves.\n\nBut I need to be at (2,5) at turn 18 start, which is after 2 moves from turn 16.\n\nFrom turn 16 to turn 18: after 2 moves.\n\nTurn 16 action to new position end of turn 16.\n\nTurn 17 action to new position end of turn 17, which is start of turn 18.\n\nSo after two actions, I am at a new cell.\n\nFrom (4,2), after two moves, I can be at cells within 2 steps.\n\nFor example, move Left to (3,2) turn 16, then Left to (2,2) turn 17, so at (2,2) start turn 18.\n\nOr move Left to (3,2) turn 16, then Up to (3,3) turn 17, at (3,3) start turn 18.\n\nOr move Up to (4,3) turn 16, then Left to (3,3) turn 17, at (3,3) start turn 18.\n\nNone of these are (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is 3 steps away: e.g., from (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5), 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nAfter 4 moves, at turn 19 start or something.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nAfter turn 16 action: position A\n\nAfter turn 17 action: position B\n\nAfter turn 18 action: position C\n\nPosition C is at start of turn 19.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start of turn 19, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 18 action.\n\nOn turn 18, I move to (2,5).\n\nTo do that, at start of turn 18, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,5), like (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5).\n\nAt start of turn 18, I am at position after turn 17 action.\n\nOn turn 17, I move to one of the adjacent cells.\n\nFor example, if at start of turn 17, I am at a cell that can reach those in one move.\n\nBut at start of turn 17, I am after turn 16 action.\n\nSo possible:\n\nSuppose on turn 16, I move to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nFor example, on turn 16, move to (3,2) (by Left)\n\nThen at start turn 17, at (3,2)\n\nOn turn 17, I can move to (3,3), (2,2), (3,1)\n\nNone of which are adjacent to (2,5).\n\n(2,2) is far from (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can only move to adjacent cells, not directly to (2,5).\n\nSo it takes multiple turns.\n\nMinimum turns to reach (2,5) from (4,2): 5 steps? |4-2| + |2-5| = 2+3=5, so 5 moves.\n\nAfter turn 16 action, I am at step 1.\n\nAfter turn 17, step 2.\n\nAfter turn 18, step 3.\n\nAfter turn 19, step 4.\n\nAfter turn 20, step 5, at (2,5) at turn 20 end, start turn 21.\n\nBut turn 20 is the last turn for food, so on turn 20, I can be at (2,5) and move to (2,6) if I am at (2,5) at start turn 20.\n\nAt start turn 20, at (2,5), then move to (2,6) on turn 20 to eat.\n\nBut to be at (2,5) at start turn 20, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 19 action.\n\nOn turn 19, move to (2,5).\n\nThen at start turn 20, at (2,5), move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nNow, can I reach (2,5) by turn 19 action.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,5) in 3 moves? 3 moves to cover 5 cells? No, each move one cell, so distance 5, requires 5 moves, but from turn 16 to turn 19 action is 3 moves.\n\nTurn 16: move to new cell, say C1\n\nTurn 17: move to C2\n\nTurn 18: move to C3\n\nTurn 19: move to C4\n\nAfter turn 19 action, at C4, which is start of turn 20.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at start turn 20, C4 = (2,5)\n\nC4 is reached on turn 19 action.\n\nFrom (4,2), after 3 moves, I can be at cells within 3 steps, but (2,5) is 5 away, so impossible to reach in 3 moves.\n\nManhattan distance 5, so requires 5 moves.\n\nAfter turn 16: at distance 4 from start\n\nAfter turn 17: at distance 3\n\nAfter turn 18: at distance 2\n\nAfter turn 19: at distance 1\n\nAfter turn 20: at (2,5)\n\nSo at start turn 20, at (2,5), then move to (2,6) on turn 20 to eat.\n\nBut (2,6) is present on turn 20, so yes.\n\nThen I can eat it on turn 20.\n\nIn this case, I need to reach (2,5) by turn 19 action.\n\nTurn 19 action: move to (2,5)\n\nSo I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,5) at start turn 19 to move to it on turn 19.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,6) is food, (3,5) might be ok, (2,4), (1,5)\n\nAt start turn 19, I need to be at one of these.\n\nFor example, (2,4) or (1,5) or (3,5)\n\nNow, from current position, can I reach (2,4) by turn 18 action.\n\nLet's find a path to (2,4) or similar.\n\nFrom (4,2), move Left to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2), move Left to (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nThen at start turn 18, at (2,2)\n\nOn turn 18, move Up to (2,3) or to (1,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,4), from (2,2), I need to move Up twice.\n\nOn turn 18, move to (2,3)\n\nThen at start turn 19, at (2,3)\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (2,4) on turn 19, then at start turn 20, at (2,4), then move to (2,5) on turn 20, but I need to be at (2,5) at start turn 20 to move to (2,6), but if I am at (2,4) at start turn 20, I can move to (2,5) on turn 20, then at start turn 21, at (2,5), but (2,6) gone.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 18 start, if I move Up to (2,3) on turn 18, at (2,3) start turn 19.\n\nOn turn 19, move Up to (2,4), at (2,4) start turn 20.\n\nOn turn 20, move Up to (2,5), at (2,5) start turn 21, too late.\n\nTo be closer faster, I need to go up earlier.\n\nOn turn 16, move Up to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 17: move Left to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 18: move Left to (2,3)\n\nThen at start turn 19, at (2,3)\n\nOn turn 19, move Up to (2,4)\n\nAt start turn 20, at (2,4)\n\nOn turn 20, move Up to (2,5)\n\nAt (2,5) start turn 21, late.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 18 start, move Up to (3,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen at (3,4) start turn 19.\n\nOn turn 19, move Left to (2,4) or to (2,5)? From (3,4) to (2,4) Left.\n\nThen at (2,4) start turn 20.\n\nThen to (2,5) on turn 20, at (2,5) start turn 21.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (1,5) or something, but it's farther.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 20 because of the distance.\n\nDistance from (4,2) to (2,6) is |4-2| + |2-6| = 2+4=6 cells, so 6 moves needed.\n\nFrom turn 16 to turn 20, I can make 5 moves (turn 16 to turn 20 actions).\n\nAfter turn 16 action: 1 move\n\nTurn 17: 2 moves\n\nTurn 18: 3 moves\n\nTurn 19: 4 moves\n\nTurn 20: 5 moves\n\nAfter 5 moves, I can be at a cell 5 steps away, but (2,6) is 6 away, so I can be at a cell distance 5 from start, which might be like (2,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) wall, or (1,6), etc.\n\nFor example, after 5 moves, I can be at (2,5), which is distance 5 from (4,2): |4-2| + |2-5| =2+3=5.\n\nThen at (2,5) at turn 20 end, start turn 21, move to (2,6) but gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,6) because it's too far and has short life.\n\nTherefore, it's better to ignore (2,6) and go for the other food or plan for long-term.\n\n(3,1) has life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating food is good.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nAnother option: from current position, I can go right or up to explore.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nThe snake body is on the left and bottom, so the right and top are more open.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move Right to (5,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen I can go up to (5,3), (5,4), etc.\n\nOr move Up to (4,3), then right, etc.\n\nBut no food there, so I need to go towards (3,1) or other areas.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is close.\n\nFrom (4,2), move Left to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move Down to (3,1) on turn 17 to eat it, as I did earlier.\n\nBut then I was stuck and had to move left to (2,1), and missed the other food.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), I was at (3,1), and moved to (2,1), then I can go up or right.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go to (2,2), (2,3), etc., but no food, and the other food is gone.\n\nOr I can go right to (3,1) but occupied, or to (2,0) wall.\n\nSo only Up or Left.\n\nIf I go Left to (1,1), then to (1,2), etc., but no food.\n\nSo score increases only when I eat food.\n\nCurrently, no other food, so I need to survive and wait for new food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so I think only these two foods are present.\n\nThe state has only these two foods listed.\n\nSo after eating (3,1), I have one food, and (2,6) disappears, so no more food, so I just need to survive as long as possible, but since no more food, score doesn't increase.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating both would be better, but I can't eat (2,6) because of distance and time.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,1) later and go for (2,6) first, but I can't reach it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the food at (2,6) can be eaten if I take a different path, but it's too far.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to reach (2,6).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,6): min Manhattan distance 6, so 6 moves.\n\nTurn 16 to turn 21: 6 moves (turn 16,17,18,19,20,21)\n\nBut on turn 21, (2,6) is gone, so I can eat on turn 20 at best, but with 5 moves, I can be at adjacent cell, like (2,5), on turn 20, then move to (2,6) on turn 20, but (2,5) is 5 away, so yes, on turn 20 action, I can move to (2,6) if I am at (2,5) at start turn 20.\n\nAnd to be at (2,5) at start turn 20, I need to move to (2,5) on turn 19 action.\n\nOn turn 19, move to (2,5).\n\nCan I reach (2,5) by turn 19 action from (4,2)?\n\nTurn 19 action is the 4th move (turn 16:1, 17:2, 18:3, 19:4)\n\nAfter 4 moves, I can be at a cell 4 steps away.\n\n(2,5) is 5 away, so impossible.\n\nFor example, after 4 moves, I can be at (2,4) or (3,5) or (2,3), etc., but not (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is 5 away: |4-2| + |2-5| =2+3=5.\n\nSo after 4 moves, I can be at cells like (2,4) distance 4, or (3,5) distance |4-3| + |2-5| =1+3=4, or (1,5) |4-1| + |2-5| =3+3=6>4, not possible in 4 moves.\n\nSo I can be at (2,4) or (3,5) after 4 moves.\n\nAt start turn 20, at (2,4) or (3,5), then on turn 20, I can move to (2,5) or directly to (2,6) if possible.\n\nFrom (2,4), move to (2,5) or to (2,6)? Not adjacent, only to (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), move to (2,5) or to (3,6) wall, or to (3,4), or (4,5).\n\nSo to (2,5), then from there, on turn 21, to (2,6) but gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,6).\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat the (3,1) food and then survive.\n\nBut when I ate (3,1) early, I was at risk of collision, but I managed to move to (2,1).\n\nFrom there, I can continue to move around.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can move Up to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc., and since no walls, I can go to the right or up.\n\nBut with the body behind, I need to avoid colliding.\n\nBut since the tail moves, it might be ok.\n\nBut no more food, so score is 1.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,1) now, and go somewhere else, but (3,1) has long life, so I can eat it later, but (2,6) will disappear, so I might eat only one food anyway.\n\nBut by not eating (3,1) now, I can explore and eat (2,6) if possible, but it's not, so same.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,1) on a way that gives me more space.\n\nFor example, from current position, instead of going left to (3,2), I go Up to (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go Left to (3,3), or Up to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen later come down to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is still there for 10 turns.\n\nSo let's plan to eat (3,1) with more space.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2), direction Up.\n\nMove Up to (4,3) on turn 16.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction Up.\n\nTurn 17: move Left to (3,3) or Up to (4,4), or Right to (5,3), etc.\n\nSuppose I move Left to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail at (6,3) gone?

body is spread out, so I have space to move up or left.\n\nBut no more food, so score is 1.\n\nSince I can only eat one food, and I get score 1, it's the same as eating early.\n\nBut in this case, I avoided the immediate risk but still ended up in the same situation.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,1) in a way that the tail is not blocking.\n\nBut in this position, the snake body is around, so when I eat at (3,1), the neck is at (3,2), so I can only move left.\n\nSo it's inevitable.\n\nTherefore, for the purpose of this game, since I can only eat one food, I should just eat (3,1) now to get the score and then survive.\n\nOr eat it later, but same score.\n\nBut by eating now, I free up the grid or something, but no new food.\n\nSo let's go back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 16, head at (4,2), move Left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move Down to (3,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 18: move Left to (2,1)\n\nThen from there, I can move Up to (2,2), and so on, to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nBut since no food, I can just move in a safe path.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move Up to (2,2), then to (2,3), to (2,4), etc., until I hit the wall, but then I die.\n\nOr I can turn right at some point.\n\nBut the grid has walls, so I need to be careful.\n\nFor instance, at (2,4), I can move Right to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut no point.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is unattainable, I should eat (3,1) and then move safely.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival, so after eating, I should move to open areas.\n\nIn the initial move, when I move to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (2,1), I am at (2,1), which is corner, but I can move up.\n\nFrom (2,1), move Up to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nTo have more space, perhaps from current position, move Up first to (4,3), then later come down to eat (3,1).\n\nBut same as before.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 16: move Left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move Down to (3,1) eat food\n\nTurn 18: move Left to (2,1)\n\nThen for turn 19, from (2,1), move Up to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: move Up to (2,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns, say 5 turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", perhaps output for 5 turns or until a point.\n\nIn the boxed answer, I need to write the actions.\n\nSince after turn 18, I am at (2,1), and I can choose to go up.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother risk: the tail reward danger, but no food under tail, so ok.\n\nSo let's decide.\n\nTurn 16: move Left\n\nTurn 17: move Down\n\nTurn 18: move Left\n\nThen from there, for turn 19: at (2,1), move Up\n\nTurn 20: at (2,2), move Up to (2,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 20 or so.\n\nSince the grid is small, I might hit wall soon, but I can continue.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose, I'll list the first few actions.\n\nI think the key is to eat the food and survive.\n\nSo for turn 16: move Left to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move Down to (3,1) eat\n\nTurn 18: move Left to (2,1)\n\nThen for turn 19: move Up to (2,2)\n\nTurn 20: move Up to (2,3)\n\nBut at turn 20, (2,6) is gone, so no issue.\n\nAnd (3,1) is eaten.\n\nSo score 1.\n\nIf I don't eat now, and go up, I might not eat any food if I delay, but (3,1) has long life, so I can eat later.\n\nBut same score.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTo maximize survival, after eating, I should go to the center or open area.\n\nFrom (2,1), after moving up, I can go right when possible.\n\nFor example, at (2,3), I can move Right to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's output for 5 turns.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 16: L (left)\n\nTurn 17: D (down)\n\nTurn 18: L (left)\n\nTurn 19: U (up)\n\nTurn 20: U (up)\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut on turn 17, when I move Down to (3,1), I eat food, so the action is valid.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating immediately to have more space.\n\nFor example, turn 16: move Up to (4,3)\n\nTurn 17: move Up to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 18: move Left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: move Left to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: move Left to (1,4) or something.\n\nBut no food, and (3,1) is still there.\n\nThen later I can go down to eat (3,1).\n\nFor example, at (2,4), move Down to (2,3), then to (2,2), to (2,1), to (3,1) to eat on turn 24 or something.\n\nBut when I eat at (3,1), I am at (3,1), with body above, so I can only move left to (2,1), same as before.\n\nAnd I delayed eating, but score same, and I survived longer, but score doesn't increase, so for score, it's the same, but survival is longer, but the goal is to maximize score, which is the number of food eaten, so eating sooner or later same score.\n\nBut by delaying, I might have risk of collision, but in this case, it might be similar.\n\nSo I think eating now is fine.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score, the AI must eat the positive food at (3,1) while avoiding the unattainable food at (2,6) due to its short remaining lifespan (disappears after turn 20). The food at (3,1) has a longer lifespan (disappears after turn 25), allowing time to reach it safely. After eating, the snake must prioritize long-term survival by moving to open areas to avoid collisions.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 16)\n- **Snake head**: (4,2), direction Up.\n- **Possible moves** (no instant reverse, avoid body/walls):\n  - Up to (4,3): Safe, empty cell.\n  - Left to (3,2): Safe, empty cell.\n  - Right to (5,2): Safe, empty cell.\n  - Down to (4,1): Invalid (body collision with neck segment).\n- **Food priorities**:\n  - (2,6): Value +1, lifespan 5 (present until turn 20, disappears turn 21). Manhattan distance from head is 6 cells (|4-2| + |2-6| = 6), requiring 6 moves. With only 4 turns until disappearance (turns 17-20), it is impossible to reach by turn 20. Ignore to avoid unnecessary risk.\n  - (3,1): Value +1, lifespan 10 (present until turn 25, disappears turn 26). Manhattan distance is 2 cells (|4-3| + |2-1| = 2), reachable in 2 moves. Eating it now secures +1 score and allows focus on survival.\n- **Path to (3,1)**:\n  - Shortest path: Move Left to (3,2) on turn 16, then Down to (3,1) on turn 17 to eat.\n  - After eating, the snake grows to 8 segments. From (3,1), only Left to (2,1) is safe (other directions cause collision or wall).\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating, move to open areas (e.g., up then right) to avoid trapping the snake. The body is concentrated on the left and bottom, so moving up creates space.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 16-20)\n1. **Turn 16**: Move Left to (3,2).  \n   - Reaches adjacent cell to (3,1), setting up for food consumption. Avoids Up/Right which delay eating.\n\n2. **Turn 17**: Move Down to (3,1) and eat food.  \n   - Gains +1 score, snake length increases to 8. Position: head (3,1), body segments follow. Only Left move is safe post-eating.\n\n3. **Turn 18**: Move Left to (2,1).  \n   - Escapes the tight spot at (3,1). Now at (2,1), with open space above.\n\n4. **Turn 19**: Move Up to (2,2).  \n   - Moves away from bottom wall and body, opening paths to less occupied areas.\n\n5. **Turn 20**: Move Up to (2,3).  \n   - Continues upward for safety. The food at (2,6) disappears this turn, so no loss.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score maximized**: Eats one food (+1) immediately, as the other is unreachable.\n- **Survival prioritized**: After eating, moves up to avoid body collisions. From (2,3), future moves can include Right to (3,3) or continue Up, keeping options open.\n- **Risk avoidance**: No instant reverse, wall collisions, or body collisions. Tail reward danger not applicable (no food under tail).\n- **5+ turns foresight**: By turn 20, the snake is safe at (2,3) with room to maneuver (e.g., to (2,4), (3,3), or (1,3)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 17: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 18: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 19: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 20: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 18,
        "score": 6,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 18, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is up, which means it was moving upwards to reach (4,4).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- Food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 3. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and it's turn 18, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so it will be gone by turn 21 if not eaten.\n\n- Food at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will last until turn 26 if not eaten.\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan my moves for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think about possible paths to the food, considering the snake's body, walls, and the life spans.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize this.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo the snake is currently like: from (4,4) down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), (6,1), and up to (6,2). So it has a sort of L-shape.\n\nHead at (4,4) moving up.\n\nAvailable moves: Since head direction is up, I can move up, left, or right, but not down because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions for turn 18: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see the positions:\n\n- Up (U): to (4,5)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,4)\n\nI need to check if these are safe:\n\n- (4,5): is this a wall? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. y=7 is top border, y=0 bottom. So (4,5) is within bounds, y=5, not 7 or 0. x=4 between 0 and 7. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), not (4,5). So no wall. Now, body collision? Snake body: positions are (4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2). (4,5) is not in this list, so safe for now. But when I move, the body will follow, so I need to consider future positions.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (3,4): not a wall, not in body positions.\n\n- (5,4): not a wall, not in body positions.\n\nAll three moves seem possible immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead to eating food and avoiding dangers.\n\nFood at (2,6) and (3,1).\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6. Life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 20? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 18, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: it will be available on turns 18,19,20, and disappear before turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 8: available for 8 turns, until turn 25, disappears before turn 26.\n\nNow, (2,6) is close to the head? Head at (4,4), (2,6) is left 2, up 2? From (4,4) to (2,6): delta x = -2, delta y = +2, so it's diagonal, but I can only move orthogonally.\n\nDistance: Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = 2+2=4, so at least 4 moves away, but with body, might be longer.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is at (3,1), head at (4,4), dx=-1, dy=-3, distance | -1 | + | -3 | =1+3=4 moves away.\n\nBut (3,1) is also occupied? Snake body has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) is free? Positions: snake has (4,1), so (3,1) is adjacent and empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n(3,1) is not occupied, and it's not a wall, so food is there.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move head to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free.\n\nNow, there's a special rule about food under body, but here food is not under body, so no issue.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is at (6,2), and no food there, so not a problem now.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (2,6) with short life span. Only 3 turns left, including current. So I need to eat it soon if possible, or decide if it's worth it.\n\nBut I should think long-term. Eating it gives +1 length, but I have to go there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has longer life span.\n\nBut let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, for turn 18, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5): then head at (4,5). From there, I can go to (2,6) in a few moves, but let's see.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,6): I could go left to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then up to (2,6). But (2,5) to (2,6) is up.\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is left, then (2,5) to (2,6) up.\n\nBut (3,5) is free? Walls: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) should be fine.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is not a wall.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5), (2,6) are not walls.\n\nNow, body: after moving to (4,5), the new positions: head to (4,5), then body: the tail moves, so (4,4) becomes body, (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) moves to where? When head moves to (4,5), the body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was, but head moves, so positions shift.\n\nAfter move U to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // (6,2) was tail, so it moves forward? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nBut when no food eaten, tail moves, so length same.\n\nSo after moving U to (4,5):\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // since (6,2) was the tail, and no food, so it is removed, and the new tail is (6,1)? Let's index.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2)  // tail is (6,2)\n\nAfter move U: head moves to (4,5), so new position 0: (4,5)\n\nThen, segment 1 moves to old position 0: (4,4)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old position 1: (4,3)\n\nSegment 3 moves to old position 2: (4,2)\n\nSegment 4 moves to old position 3: (4,1)\n\nSegment 5 moves to old position 4: (5,1)\n\nSegment 6 moves to old position 5: (6,1)\n\nAnd tail was segment 6, which moved to (6,1), but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new body is from (4,4) down to (4,1), then (5,1), and (6,1) becomes the new tail.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // (6,1) is tail, and (6,2) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,4): head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // (6,2) removed.\n\nMove R to (5,4): head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // (6,2) removed.\n\nNow, back to food.\n\nFood at (2,6) life span 3, available turns 18,19,20.\n\nTo eat it, I need head at (2,6) by turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,1) available longer.\n\nNow, (3,1) is closer in terms of position but might be blocked by body.\n\nLet's plan to eat (2,6) first since it's time-sensitive.\n\nFrom head (4,4), I can go left or up to approach (2,6).\n\nIf I go left to (3,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go up to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go left to (2,5) on turn 20? Turn 20 is the last chance to eat, since life span ends after turn 20.\n\nLife span: at turn 18, life span 3, so available on turn 18,19,20. Disappears before turn 21.\n\nSo to eat on turn 20, head must be at (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 19, I need to go to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,6): I can move left to (2,5) or up to (3,6), but (3,6) is wall, obstacle, so cannot go there. So only left to (2,5) or down to (3,4), but down is away.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, R, but R to (4,5) is possible, but not towards (2,6).\n\nL to (2,5) is possible.\n\nU to (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (3,4)\n\nSo only L or D or R.\n\nTo reach (2,6) from (3,5), I need to go to (2,5) first, then to (2,6).\n\nBut from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, then from (2,5) to (2,6) is up.\n\nOn turn 19, if I'm at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nThen on turn 20, from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nBut turn 20 is when I eat it.\n\nNow, how to get to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nFrom current turn 18, if I move L to (3,4), then turn 19 move U to (3,5), then turn 20 move L to (2,5), then turn 21 move U to (2,6), but on turn 20, I need to be at (2,6) to eat before it disappears.\n\nWith this, on turn 20 I'm at (2,5), and (2,6) is still there? Turn 20 is the last turn it exists, so I can eat on turn 20.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 20, then on turn 21 I can go to (2,6), but on turn 21 it disappears, so I might miss it.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, meaning it is present for N turns, including the current one.\n\nSo for food at (2,6) with life span 3 at turn 18:\n\n- Present on turn 18\n\n- Present on turn 19\n\n- Present on turn 20\n\n- Disappears before turn 21, so not present on turn 21.\n\nTherefore, to eat it, I must be on (2,6) on turn 18, 19, or 20.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nIn the above plan, if on turn 20 I am at (2,5), I cannot eat on turn 20 because I'm not on (2,6). On turn 21, food is gone, so I miss it.\n\nTherefore, to eat on turn 20, I need to be at (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 19, I need to go directly to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nBut from (3,5), (2,6) is diagonally adjacent, not orthogonally. I can only move orthogonally.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (2,6), I must go through (2,5) or (3,6), but (3,6) is wall, so only via (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is not (2,6), so I cannot go directly from (3,5) to (2,6) in one move; it takes two moves: to (2,5) then to (2,6).\n\nTherefore, from (3,5), I can reach (2,6) on turn 21, but food is gone by then.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (2,6) if I start from (4,4) on turn 18 with this approach.\n\nCan I reach it faster?\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 18, if I go up to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5) on turn 19, I can go left to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5) on turn 20, go left to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 21, go up to (2,6), but food gone.\n\nStill too late.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 19, instead of left, I can go up to (4,6), but (4,6) is within bounds? y=6, not 7, so ok.\n\nThen from (4,6) on turn 20, go left to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, cannot go there.\n\nFrom (4,6), go left to (3,6) impossible, or down to (4,5), or right to (5,6), or up to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, border, so cannot go up.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: D, L (but (3,6) wall), R, so only D or R.\n\nCannot go to (2,6) from there.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6. From (4,5), I can go left to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (2,6).\n\nBut as before, takes two moves from (3,5) to (2,6), but (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,6).\n\nMinimum two moves from any point to (2,6) except if adjacent.\n\nIs there a point adjacent to (2,6)? (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 wall, (1,6), (3,6) wall. So only (2,5) and (1,6) are adjacent.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not wall.\n\nAnd (2,5).\n\nFrom head at (4,4), Manhattan distance to (2,6) is |4-2| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4, so at least 4 moves if no obstacles.\n\nBut with the body, it might be possible.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (2,6) in 2 moves? Not possible orthogonally.\n\nIn 3 moves: e.g., L to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then U to (2,6) — 4 moves.\n\nOr U to (4,5), L to (3,5), L to (2,5), U to (2,6) — 4 moves.\n\nOr other paths, but minimum 4 moves to reach (2,6) from (4,4).\n\nSince I start on turn 18, after 4 moves, I would be at (2,6) on turn 22, but food gone by turn 21.\n\nTurn 18: start, after 0 moves at (4,4)\n\nTurn 19: after 1 move, e.g. to (3,4) or (4,5)\n\nTurn 20: after 2 moves, e.g. to (3,5) or (2,5) if possible\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,5) in one move? Not orthogonal; must go to (2,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nLet's list:\n\nAfter turn 18 move: position at end of turn 18\n\nAfter turn 19 move: position at end of turn 19\n\netc.\n\nTo be at (2,6) on turn n.\n\nEarliest possible: from (4,4) on turn 18, after 4 moves:\n\nTurn 18: move to, say, (3,4) or (4,5)\n\nTurn 19: from there to, say, (3,5)\n\nTurn 20: to (2,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) wall, so to (2,5)\n\nTurn 21: to (2,6)\n\nBut on turn 21, food is not present, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf I could be at (2,6) on turn 20, but with 2 moves from start, impossible since min 4 moves.\n\nFor example, on turn 19, if I were at (3,6) or (2,5), but (3,6) is wall, (2,5) is not adjacent to (2,6)? (2,5) is adjacent to (2,6), yes, up or down.\n\n(2,5) to (2,6) is one move up.\n\nBut to be at (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 18, to (2,5) in one move? No, min distance  |4-2| + |4-5| = 2+1=3 moves? |4-2|=2, |4-5|=1, total 3.\n\nFor example: turn 18 move L to (3,4)  // x=3,y=4\n\nThen turn 19 move L to (2,4)  // if possible, but (2,4) is free? Assuming no obstacles.\n\nThen turn 20 move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 21 move U to (2,6)\n\nStill turn 21, food gone.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 19, I can move U to (3,5), then turn 20 to (2,5), turn 21 to (2,6).\n\nSame.\n\nTo be at (2,5) on turn 19.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 18, move U to (4,5)\n\nThen on turn 19, from (4,5), move L to (3,5)? Then turn 20 to (2,5), turn 21 to (2,6).\n\nOr from (4,5), move directly to (2,5)? Not possible.\n\nShortest path to (2,5): from (4,4) to (2,5): dx=2, dy=1, min 3 moves.\n\ne.g., L to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then L to (2,5) — but (3,5) to (2,5) is L, yes.\n\nTurn 18: L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 20: L to (2,5)\n\nThen on turn 20, I am at (2,5), and food at (2,6) is present, but I'm not on it. On turn 21, I can move U to (2,6), but food gone.\n\nIf I go to (2,6) directly, but I can't from (2,5) on same turn.\n\nThe only way to eat on turn 20 is to be at (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) from (4,4) in 2 moves: impossible, since not adjacent and min 4 moves as above.\n\nFor example, (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (2,6) — 4 moves.\n\nOr (4,4) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,6) — 4 moves.\n\nNo shorter way.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat the food at (2,6) because it will disappear before I can reach it. I need at least 4 moves to get there, which would be on turn 22 or later for the position, but turn 21 for the cell, but food gone on turn 21.\n\nTurn 18: at (4,4)\n\nAfter 1 move: turn 19 at e.g. (3,4)\n\nAfter 2 moves: turn 20 at e.g. (2,4) or (3,5)\n\nAfter 3 moves: turn 21 at e.g. (2,5) or (3,6) but wall, so (2,5)\n\nAfter 4 moves: turn 22 at (2,6)\n\nBut food present until turn 20, so on turn 20 at (2,5), food at (2,6) is present, but I'm not on it. On turn 21, I move to (2,6), but food gone, so I don't eat it.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food at (2,6); it's too far and time is short. So I should ignore it and focus on the other food or long-term survival.\n\nNow, the other food at (3,1) with value 1, life span 8, so available until turn 25.\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1.\n\nHead at (4,4), so dx= -1, dy= -3, distance 4.\n\nBut I can reach it in fewer moves possibly.\n\nAlso, (3,1) is near the body.\n\nCurrent body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc.\n\n(3,1) is free.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to move head to (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), possible to go down or left, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nFirst, for turn 18, I need to choose move: U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,4), then I can go down to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), but need to check if cells are free.\n\n(3,4) to (3,3) down, then to (3,2) down, then to (3,1) down.\n\nBut (3,1) has food, so when I move to (3,1), I eat it.\n\nNow, how many turns.\n\nTurn 18: move L to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 19: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 21: move D to (3,1) and eat food.\n\nFood at (3,1) life span 8, turn 18 to turn 25, so turn 21 is fine, within span.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nBut let's see if this path is safe.\n\nFirst, on turn 18, move L to (3,4): is it safe? (3,4) not wall, not in body positions.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // (6,2) removed, so tail at (6,1)\n\n(3,4) is free, ok.\n\nTurn 19: move D to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail (6,1) removed? When head moves to (3,3), body segments move: segment 1 to (3,4), segment 2 to old (4,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 18: positions: head (3,4), body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // indices: 0:(3,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(4,2), 4:(4,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(6,1) tail\n\nMove D to (3,3): new head (3,3)\n\nThen body: segment 1 moves to old head (3,4)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,4)\n\nSegment 3 to old segment 2 (4,3)\n\nSegment 4 to old segment 3 (4,2)\n\nSegment 5 to old segment 4 (4,1)\n\nSegment 6 to old segment 5 (5,1)\n\nAnd tail segment 6 moved to (5,1), no food, so removed? Since no food eaten, tail is not added, so the last segment is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // tail at (5,1)\n\n(6,1) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, turn 20: move D to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (5,1) removed, new tail (4,1)\n\nPositions after turn 19: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nMove D to (3,2): head (3,2)\n\nBody: seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (4,4), seg4 to (4,3), seg5 to (4,2), seg6 to (4,1)\n\nNo food, so tail removed, new body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (4,1)\n\n(5,1) removed.\n\nTurn 21: move D to (3,1) and eat food.\n\n(3,1) is the target.\n\nNow, when moving to (3,1), it is food, so I eat it, and the snake grows, so tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo after move to (3,1), head at (3,1), body segments: the previous body plus the old tail position becomes new segment.\n\nSpecifically: before move, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (4,1)\n\nMove to (3,1): new head (3,1)\n\nThen body: each segment moves to previous position: seg1 to old head (3,2), seg2 to old seg1 (3,3), ..., seg7 to old seg6 (4,1)? Number of segments.\n\nBefore move, 7 segments: head and 6 body, tail at (4,1).\n\nAfter move, head to (3,1), and since food eaten, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), then the body is: old head position (3,2), then old seg1 position (3,3), old seg2 (3,4), old seg3 (4,4), old seg4 (4,3), old seg5 (4,2), and the new segment at old tail position (4,1).\n\nSo positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // 8 segments.\n\nNow, all safe so far.\n\nBut I need to think about the direction. On turn 18, head direction was U, but after moving L to (3,4), new direction is L.\n\nThen move D to (3,3), direction D.\n\nThen D to (3,2), D.\n\nThen D to (3,1), D.\n\nAll fine, no instant reverse issue.\n\nNow, but is there a better way? Or should I consider other moves.\n\nFor example, if I go R on turn 18 to (5,4), then I might have to go around to reach (3,1), which might take longer.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,5) might lead me away.\n\nBut (3,1) is below and left, so going left or down is better.\n\nBut I can only move U,L,R now, not D, because no reverse.\n\nCurrent direction U, so I can't go D this turn.\n\nSo only U,L,R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), then I am farther from (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, R to (5,4) also farther.\n\nL to (3,4) is closer to (3,1).\n\nMoreover, with the above plan, I can eat the food on turn 21.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n\nAfter eating, I need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,1) is on the same row as part of the body.\n\nIn the path, when I move to (3,2) on turn 20, and then to (3,1) on turn 21, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see the body positions during this.\n\nFor example, on turn 19, when at (3,3), body includes (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc., no collision.\n\n(3,3) not in body.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 20, at (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), etc., (3,2) not in body.\n\nOn turn 21, at (3,1), which is free.\n\nNow, after eating, snake longer, and I need to find more food or move safely.\n\nBut currently only two food, but perhaps more will spawn, but not specified, so I assume only these for now.\n\nThe state gives current food, but new food might spawn later, but I don't know, so I should plan with current information.\n\nFor long-term survival, after eating, I need to have space to move.\n\nAfter eating at (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is along x=3 from y=1 to 4, then to (4,4), down to (4,1).\n\nHead at (3,1), direction down (since came from above).\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves: since direction D, I can go L, R, or D, but not U (reverse).\n\nL to (2,1), R to (4,1), D to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot go D.\n\ny=0 is bottom border wall, so (3,0) invalid.\n\nSimilarly, U not allowed because reverse.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nL to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nNow, (4,1) is part of the body? Positions: (4,1) is the last segment, but when I move, the body shifts.\n\nBut at this point, (4,1) is occupied by body, so I cannot move to (4,1) because collision.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied, so moving R to (4,1) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,1): is (2,1) free? Assuming no wall, and not in body positions, so should be safe.\n\nThen moving D not possible, wall.\n\nU not possible, reverse.\n\nSo only L to (2,1) is possible from (3,1) after eating.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut for now, with the plan to go left and down to eat the food, it seems feasible.\n\nBut I should consider if there are risks.\n\nAnother move: on turn 18, if I go R to (5,4), then I can go down to (5,3), etc., but to reach (3,1), it might take longer and I might not get there in time, but since life span long, possible, but inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,5) might lead to dead end or something.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (4,5), then positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), but then at (4,6), I can only go D or R, since L to (3,6) wall, U to (4,7) wall.\n\nSo go R to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go down, etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it's farther.\n\nFor instance, from (4,5) to (3,1): need to go down and left, but with body, might be complicated.\n\nWhereas going left directly is shorter.\n\nMoreover, by going left, I can eat the food sooner, on turn 21.\n\nIf I go other ways, it might take more turns, and the food might be at risk if something, but no other threats.\n\nBut I should confirm if I can eat it faster.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I could go down, but I can't because reverse not allowed; direction U, so D is opposite, not possible this turn.\n\nSo only U,L,R.\n\nL is best for reaching (3,1).\n\nR might be ok, but longer.\n\nU leads to top, which might be restrictive.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (3,6), but not affecting directly.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 18 is good.\n\nThen as planned: turn 18 L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19 D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20 D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 21 D to (3,1) eat food.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5+ turns ahead? The answer format should be for a sequence, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I should plan several moves.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 21, I need to continue.\n\nSince food eaten on turn 21, and after that, I need to move to safe area.\n\nFrom (3,1) after eating, as I said, only possible move L to (2,1), assuming (2,1) is free and not wall.\n\n(2,1) is not wall, borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,1) is fine.\n\nThen head to (2,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen body: after eating at (3,1), positions as above.\n\nMove L to (2,1): new head (2,1)\n\nBody: seg1 to old head (3,1), seg2 to old seg1 (3,2), ..., and since no food, tail not added, but when moving, no food eaten this move, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // 8 segments\n\nMove to (2,1): no food at (2,1), so no eat, thus tail is removed.\n\nNew head (2,1)\n\nBody: seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (3,2), ..., up to seg7 to old seg6 (4,2)? Let's index.\n\nPositions before move: 0:head (3,1), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,1) tail\n\nMove to (2,1): new head (2,1)\n\nThen body: seg1 moves to old pos 0: (3,1)\n\nseg2 to old pos 1: (3,2)\n\n...\n\nseg7 to old pos 6: (4,2)\n\nAnd tail was seg7, moved to (4,2), but no food, so removed. Thus new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,1) is now empty.\n\nFrom (2,1), direction L, so I can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nL to (1,1), U to (2,2), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, so cannot D.\n\nSo U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) might be free, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify too far, but for the plan, I can output up to turn 21 or so.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is not reachable, I can ignore it.\n\nBut to be thorough, is there any way to reach (2,6) in time? I don't think so, as calculated.\n\nPerhaps from other paths, but no.\n\nSo for turn 18, action L.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output actions for turn 18, 19, 20, 21, and beyond.\n\nBut turn 21 I eat, then after that I need to move.\n\nTo maximize score, after eating, I should look for other food, but only one left, which is not reachable or gone.\n\n(2,6) will be gone by turn 21.\n\nAfter that, no food specified, so I need to survive and wait for new food, but since not specified, I should just avoid dying.\n\nIn the plan, going down to (3,1) is fine.\n\nBut on turn 20, when I am at (3,2), moving to (3,1), is there any risk?\n\n(3,1) has food, but no issue.\n\nAlso, the body: when I move to (3,1), the body is at (3,2), (3,3), etc., so no collision.\n\nAfter that, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving right on turn 18.\n\nBut that might be worse.\n\nAnother idea: if I go down indirectly.\n\nBut I can't go down this turn.\n\nSuppose I go R to (5,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, turn 18 R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 19 D to (5,3)  // assuming free\n\nTurn 20 L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body? On turn, positions change.\n\nAfter turn 18 R to (5,4): positions head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(4,3) is body, so if I go to (4,3) on turn 19, collision.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nL to (4,4): (4,4) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,3) might be free.\n\n(5,3) not in body, not wall.\n\nThen U to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), I can go D to (5,3), then L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? After turn 18, positions include (4,3), which is body.\n\nAfter turn 18 move to (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo (4,3) occupied.\n\nIf on turn 19 I move L to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (5,3), which is free.\n\nThen turn 19 at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 20, from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? Positions now: after turn 19, head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // (6,1) removed\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so cannot move to (4,3).\n\nMove D to (5,2), if free.\n\n(5,2) not occupied.\n\nThen to (5,2), then L to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 19: positions head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n(4,2) occupied, so cannot move to (4,2) directly.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nThis is messy and takes more turns to reach (3,1).\n\nWhereas going left directly is simpler and fewer turns.\n\nTherefore, for turn 18, moving L to (3,4) is best.\n\nThen for turn 19, moving D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20 D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 21 D to (3,1) eat.\n\nThen for turn 22, from (3,1), move L to (2,1) as only choice.\n\nThen from (2,1), move U to (2,2) or L to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut since no food, I can choose arbitrarily, but to survive, I should go to open area.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move U to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc., towards center.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for the answer, I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=18, so I need actions for turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D (to eat)\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,1), after eating, direction D, but after moving D to (3,1), direction is D.\n\nThen turn 22, possible moves: since direction D, I can move L, R, D, but D to (3,0) wall, not possible. U reverse not possible. R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision. L to (2,1) is only choice.\n\nSo turn 22: L to (2,1)\n\nThen from (2,1), direction L, so can move U, D, L.\n\nD to (2,0) wall, not possible. So U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) should be free, not wall, not body at that time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) free.\n\nI can go U to (2,2) to go up.\n\nThen from there, continue.\n\nBut for the plan, I can output up to turn 22.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 18 to 22 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 18,19,20,21,22: that's 5 turns.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nt1=18, turn 18,19,20,21,22: 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 21 I eat, which is good.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,6), it will disappear on its own, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut to be complete, let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, in turn 20, when I move to (3,2), is it safe? Position (3,2), let's see body at that time.\n\nAfter turn 19: positions head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  // from earlier\n\nIn turn 19, after move D to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nThen turn 20 move D to (3,2): new head (3,2), which is free.\n\nBody: seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (4,4), seg4 to (4,3), seg5 to (4,2), seg6 to (4,1), and seg7? Before move, 7 segments: head and 6 body? Head and 6 body segments, total 7.\n\nAfter move: head to (3,2), body: seg1 to old head (3,3), seg2 to old seg1 (3,4), seg3 to old seg2 (4,4), seg4 to old seg3 (4,3), seg5 to old seg4 (4,2), seg6 to old seg5 (4,1), and old seg6 (5,1) is tail, moved to (4,1)? No.\n\nPositions before move: 0:head (3,3), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(5,1) tail\n\nMove to (3,2): new head (3,2)\n\nThen body: seg1 to old pos 0: (3,3)\n\nseg2 to old pos 1: (3,4)\n\nseg3 to old pos 2: (4,4)\n\nseg4 to old pos 3: (4,3)\n\nseg5 to old pos 4: (4,2)\n\nseg6 to old pos 5: (4,1)\n\nAnd tail was seg6, moved to (4,1), but no food, so removed. Thus new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  // tail (4,1)\n\n(5,1) removed.\n\nThen (3,2) is not in body, so safe.\n\nThen turn 21 move D to (3,1): (3,1) is food, so eat.\n\nNew head (3,1), body: old head (3,2), old seg1 (3,3), old seg2 (3,4), old seg3 (4,4), old seg4 (4,3), old seg5 (4,2), old seg6 (4,1), and new segment at old tail position, which was (4,1), but since tail moved? When eating, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving.\n\nBefore move to (3,1), tail is at (4,1)\n\nAfter move, head to (3,1), body includes all previous positions except tail is not removed, and new segment added at previous tail position.\n\nSo positions: head (3,1), then body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and (4,1)  // since (4,1) was tail, and not removed, so it stays, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (4,1), so (4,1) is still there? Confusion.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, the tail does not move; so the snake grows by one segment at the tail.\n\nSo before move, positions: head, body, tail.\n\nWhen head moves to food cell, the tail remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, but the tail does not move; it stays, and the new head position is added.\n\nSo the list of positions increases by one.\n\nBefore move: [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ] but (3,2) is head? Before move on turn 21, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail? Earlier: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) so tail is (4,1)\n\nMove to (3,1): since (3,1) has food, head moves to (3,1), and the tail does not move, so the new positions are: head (3,1), then the previous head becomes body: (3,2), then previous body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail remains (4,1), so now 8 positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nYes.\n\nThen from there, as before.\n\nFor turn 22, move L to (2,1), safe.\n\nThen I can continue, but for output, up to turn 22 is fine.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nIn the plan, I have turns 18 to 22.\n\nBut turn 18 action is L, which I decided.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 20, I move D to (3,2), then turn 21 D to (3,1).\n\nBut after turn 22, I need to move, but I can specify.\n\nPerhaps I can output 5 actions: turn 18 to 22.\n\nt1=18, so turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nActions: L, D, D, D, L\n\nBut on turn 22, it's L to (2,1).\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is not eaten, and I focus on (3,1).\n\nBut just to be sure, is there a way to eat both? Probably not, since (2,6) too far.\n\nPerhaps after eating (3,1), I can go to other areas, but (2,6) gone.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 18: L\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nBut turn 22 L is after eating.\n\nIn terms of maximizing score, I eat one food, which is good.\n\nIf I don't eat, I survive but no score.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not going for food and just survive, but eating gives score and length, which might help in future, but also makes snake longer, harder to maneuver, but here grid has space.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, but I can move to left side.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go up to (2,2), then (2,3), etc., to top left.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (3,1) due to its longer life span (8 turns, available until turn 25) while avoiding the food at (2,6), which cannot be reached before it disappears after turn 20. The path to (3,1) is direct and safe, taking 3 moves from the current position. After eating, the snake moves left to (2,1) to avoid collisions and position itself for future exploration.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Life span of 3 turns means it disappears after turn 20. The Manhattan distance from (4,4) to (2,6) is 4, requiring at least 4 moves. The earliest arrival is turn 22, after the food has disappeared. Thus, it is ignored.\n- **Food at (3,1)**: Life span of 8 turns allows eating by turn 21. The path (4,4) → (3,4) → (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1) is safe and efficient.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current head direction is U (up), so D (down) is not allowed on turn 18 (no instant reverse). After moving, new directions are updated to prevent reverse moves.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments. After eating at (3,1), the snake grows, but moving left to (2,1) on turn 22 is the only safe option to prevent collision with the body at (4,1).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 22, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., moving up from (2,1)) to avoid dead ends. The grid has space, and no immediate threats exist beyond the planned moves.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 Turns):\n- **Turn 18 (from (4,4))**: Move L (left) to (3,4). This starts the path toward (3,1) and avoids moving away or into risky areas. Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 19 (from (3,4))**: Move D (down) to (3,3). Continues toward (3,1) safely. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 20 (from (3,3))**: Move D (down) to (3,2). Positions the snake to eat on the next turn. Direction remains D.\n- **Turn 21 (from (3,2))**: Move D (down) to (3,1) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 8). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 22 (from (3,1))**: Move L (left) to (2,1). This is the only safe move (D blocked by wall, R blocked by body at (4,1), U is reverse). Direction becomes L, allowing future moves to open areas (e.g., U to (2,2)).\n\n### Future Considerations (Beyond Turn 22):\n- From (2,1), move U (up) to (2,2) to access the top-left area, which has more space and potential for new food.\n- Avoid the obstacle at (3,6) and walls; prioritize open paths for survival.\n- If new food spawns, evaluate based on value, life span, and reachability.\n\nThis plan eats one food, increasing score by 1, and ensures survival for at least 5 turns with a clear escape route.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) being bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, but in programming, it might be top-left. I should confirm.\n\nThe walls are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so that defines the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the tail is at (6,1).\n\nSnake head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left last turn. From the positions, head was at (4,4) at turn 18? Let's see the positions: current head is (3,4), and previous head was (4,4) since it moved left to (3,4). Direction is L, so it's facing left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 19, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 20? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for food at (2,6), life span 2 at turn 19. That means it will count down to 1 at turn 20, and disappear after turn 20, so it's gone at turn 21. But since we act on turns, it can be eaten on turn 19 or 20.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) with value 1, life span 7, so it will last until turn 19 + 7 - 1? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t, life span N, it decreases each turn, so:\n\n- Turn t: countdown N, can be eaten\n\n- Turn t+1: countdown N-1, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + (N-1): countdown 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn t + (N-1), it disappears, so not available on turn t + N.\n\nFor (2,6): at turn 19, N=2, so can be eaten on turn 19 (countdown 2) or turn 20 (countdown 1), gone after turn 20.\n\nFor (3,1): N=7, so available from turn 19 to turn 25 (since 19+6=25, countdown from 6 to 1? Turn 19: countdown 7, turn 20:6, ..., turn 25: countdown 1, gone after turn 25.\n\nTurn 19: countdown 7\n\nTurn 20: countdown 6\n\n...\n\nTurn 25: countdown 1 (since 19 to 25 is 7 turns? 19,20,21,22,23,24,25 — that's 7 turns, but countdown decreases each turn.\n\nStart: turn 19, countdown = N\n\nAfter turn 19, countdown decreases, so at the beginning of turn 20, countdown is N-1.\n\nSimilarly, at beginning of turn t, countdown is initial N minus (t - t_initial).\n\nSet t_initial = 19 for (2,6), N=2.\n\nAt start of turn 19: countdown = 2\n\nAfter turn 19 action, if not eaten, countdown decreases to 1 for turn 20.\n\nAt start of turn 20: countdown = 1\n\nAfter turn 20, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1): t_initial=19, N=7\n\nStart turn 19: countdown=7\n\nStart turn 20: countdown=6\n\n...\n\nStart turn 25: countdown=1\n\nAfter turn 25, disappears.\n\nNow, (6,1) with value 1, life span 10. But (6,1) is also the tail position of the snake! Snake positions include (6,1) as the tail.\n\nFood at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10.\n\nBut the snake is currently on (6,1), so the food is under the snake's body.\n\nAccording to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for food at (6,1), it's under the tail, so to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head moves there.\n\nBut the head is at (3,4), which is far, so it might not be immediate.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, head is at (3,4), tail at (6,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so Manhattan distance 1. (3,4) to (6,1) is |3-6| + |4-1| = 3+3=6, not adjacent. So no danger now.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should be for turns starting from t1=19, so I need to output actions for turn 19, 20, 21, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Probably, I should plan for at least 5 turns, but output as many as I can decide reasonably.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake: positions: head (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So length 7 segments.\n\nHead direction is L, so it just moved left to (3,4) from (4,4).\n\nNow, possible moves from head position (3,4):\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (3,5)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (3,3)\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (2,4) — but head direction is L, so moving left is possible, but is it reverse? Current direction is L, so moving left is same direction, not reverse.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,5)\n\n- D: (3,3)\n\n- L: (2,4) — since current dir L, moving L is fine.\n\n- R: (4,4) — but (4,4) is the first body segment, and moving there would cause collision? (4,4) is the neck, so if I move right to (4,4), the head would be at (4,4), but the body is also there, so it would collide with itself.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves: head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away from its current position.\n\nBut if head moves into a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides and dies.\n\nIn this case, from (3,4), moving:\n\n- U to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (3,5) is not in the list, so empty? But we have to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: border walls, so (3,5) is within 0-7, x=3, y=5, not border wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=5 is fine. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not (3,6), so (3,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,3): (3,3) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) not in snake positions, not wall.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is the first body segment, so if I move there, head collides with body at (4,4), so death. Also, moving opposite: current direction L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible safe moves from (3,4): U, D, L.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (2,6): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 20 or it disappears.\n\n- (3,1): value +1, life span 7, plenty of time.\n\n- (6,1): value +1, life span 10, but it's under the tail at (6,1). Since the tail is there, we can't eat it now. To eat, tail must move away first.\n\nAlso, (3,1) is a food, but (3,1) is currently occupied? Snake positions: (4,1) is body, (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) is not listed, so it should be free, but there's food at (3,1), so it's occupied by food, but the snake is not on it.\n\nFood at (3,1), and snake has (4,1), which is adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) has food and snake tail.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term. Positive food gives +1 score and increases length, negative food would decrease, but here all foods are +1, so no negative food in this state.\n\nAll values are 1, so all positive.\n\nBut for (6,1), if we eat it, we need to be careful with tail danger.\n\nNow, let's consider the time sensitivity.\n\nFood at (2,6) has short life span, only 2 turns including current, so it must be eaten on turn 19 or 20.\n\nTurn 19: if we eat it now, or turn 20.\n\nBut from (3,4), (2,6) is at (2,6), which is two steps away: for example, to (2,4) then to (2,5) then to (2,6)? (3,4) to (2,6) is not adjacent; we need to move.\n\nDistance: |3-2|=1, |4-6|=2, so Manhattan distance 3, so at least 3 moves away.\n\nFrom (3,4), to reach (2,6):\n\nOne path: L to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then U to (2,6). That's 3 moves.\n\nOr U to (3,5), then U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(3,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot go to (3,6).\n\nSo from (3,4), U to (3,5) is possible, but then to (2,6)? From (3,5), can go L to (2,5), then U to (2,6).\n\nOr from (3,5) U to (3,6) but obstacle, so cannot.\n\nSo only via (2,5) or similar.\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, and walls at y=7, but y=6 is fine.\n\nNow, to eat (2,6) on turn 19, we need to be there now, but we are at (3,4), not adjacent, so impossible on turn 19. Must be on turn 20.\n\nOn turn 20, we need head at (2,6).\n\nSo we need to reach (2,6) by turn 20.\n\nCurrent turn 19, so after this move.\n\nAfter turn 19 action, on turn 20 we move to (2,6).\n\nSo from current position (3,4), we need to be at a position on turn 19 such that from there we can move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nPositions adjacent to (2,6): (2,5), (2,7), (1,6), (3,6)\n\nBut (2,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not wall? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 is fine.\n\n(3,6): obstacle, invalid.\n\n(2,5): valid.\n\nSo only possible adjacent cells to (2,6) are (2,5) and (1,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6) on turn 20, on turn 19 we must be at (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nNow, from current (3,4), can we reach (2,5) or (1,6) in one move?\n\n(3,4) to (2,5): not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent; moves are only orthogonal, so not possible in one move.\n\nTo (1,6): |3-1|=2, |4-6|=2, not adjacent.\n\nSo we cannot be at (2,5) or (1,6) on turn 19 starting from (3,4); it's impossible to eat (2,6) on turn 19 or 20 because we are too far.\n\nTurn 19: we move to one of U, D, L from (3,4).\n\nSay we move to (3,5), (3,3), or (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 20, from there, we can move, but to reach (2,6) on turn 20, we need to be adjacent on turn 19.\n\nBut from (3,5), (2,5) is adjacent, so if we go to (2,5) on turn 19, then on turn 20 to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5) to (1,6) not adjacent.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5) is adjacent, then to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,6) not possible directly.\n\nSo, to eat on turn 20, we need to be at (2,5) or (1,6) on turn 19.\n\nBut on turn 19, we start at (3,4), and we can only move to adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,3), (2,4).\n\nNone of these are (2,5) or (1,6). (2,4) is one of them.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can go to (2,5) on turn 20, but (2,6) is at (2,6), so from (2,5) to (2,6) on turn 20 would eat it.\n\nBut on turn 19, if we move to (2,4), then on turn 20 to (2,5), but that's not eating (2,6); we need to be at (2,5) on turn 19 to go to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\n- Turn 19: we choose an action, which moves the head to a new cell. After moving, if that cell has food, we eat it immediately.\n\n- Similarly, on turn 20, we move to a cell, and if food there, we eat it.\n\nTo eat food at (2,6) on turn 20, we need to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nThat means on turn 20, before moving, head is at some position adjacent to (2,6), and we move to (2,6).\n\nThe position before turn 20 action is the position after turn 19 action.\n\nAfter turn 19 action, head is at, say, P.\n\nThen on turn 20, we move from P to Q, and if Q has food, we eat it.\n\nTo eat (2,6) on turn 20, we need Q = (2,6), so we move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nThat requires that on turn 19 after action, head is at a cell adjacent to (2,6), so that we can move to it on turn 20.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,6) are (2,5), (2,7), (1,6), (3,6).\n\n(2,7) is wall, (3,6) is obstacle, so only (2,5) and (1,6).\n\nSo after turn 19 action, head must be at (2,5) or (1,6) to be able to move to (2,6) on turn 20.\n\nBut at turn 19 start, head is at (3,4).\n\nAfter turn 19 action, head can be at (3,5), (3,3), or (2,4).\n\nNone of these are (2,5) or (1,6).\n\n(2,4) is possible, but (2,4) is not adjacent to (2,6); (2,4) to (2,6) is not adjacent, |dy|=2.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can move to (2,5) on turn 20, but (2,5) is not (2,6); to eat on turn 20, we need to move directly to (2,6), which we can't from (2,4) in one move.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,6) on turn 19 or 20 because we cannot reach it in time.\n\nThe only way would be to be at (2,5) on turn 19, but we start at (3,4), and in one move we can't reach (2,5) since it's diagonal.\n\nSo (2,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 20 without being eaten.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 19, so after turn 20 it disappears, so only chance was turn 19 or 20, but we can't reach it, so we ignore this food; it's not feasible.\n\nSimilarly, for other foods.\n\nNow, food at (3,1) is available for many turns, life span 7.\n\nFood at (6,1) under tail, life span 10, also long.\n\nBut (6,1) is tail, so we can eat it later when tail moves.\n\nNow, snake current positions: head (3,4), body down to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\nThe body is mostly in the bottom row, y=1, from x=4 to x=6, and at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), so it's like a column at x=4 from y=1 to y=4, then head at (3,4).\n\nWe need to think about movements.\n\nAlso, head direction L, so moving left is natural.\n\nPossible moves on turn 19: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, U to (3,5): (3,5) is free, no wall, no snake, not obstacle.\n\nThen after moving, head at (3,5), body follows: neck was (4,4) moves to (3,4), then (4,3) to (4,4), (4,2) to (4,3), (4,1) to (4,2), (5,1) to (4,1), (6,1) to (5,1), and tail moves away from (6,1).\n\n(6,1) had food, but since tail moves, the food is still there, but not eaten yet.\n\nAfter move, snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTail at (5,1).\n\nFood at (6,1) is now exposed, since tail moved to (5,1), so (6,1) is free with food.\n\nBut head is at (3,5), far away.\n\nFrom (3,5), we can go U, but (3,6) is obstacle, so cannot U.\n\nD to (3,4), but (3,4) is now body, so collision.\n\nL to (2,5)\n\nR to (4,5)\n\nOr D, but D to (3,4) is body, death.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), U impossible, D impossible because (3,4) is body.\n\n(3,4) is the second segment now.\n\nAfter turn 19 U to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), segment 1: (3,4), segment 2: (4,4), etc.\n\nSo (3,4) is occupied, so moving down to (3,4) causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) obstacle, so only left or right: to (2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free? No snake, no wall, not obstacle, so yes.\n\nSecond option on turn 19: D to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) free? Snake positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc. (4,3) is body, but (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\nWalls: y=0 bottom, y=3 fine.\n\nObstacle (3,6) not here.\n\nSo move D to (3,3).\n\nThen new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail was (6,1) moves to (5,1), so (6,1) free with food.\n\nFrom (3,3), can go U to (3,4) but (3,4) is now body, collision.\n\nD to (3,2)\n\nL to (2,3)\n\nR to (4,3) but (4,3) is body? After move, positions: head (3,3), then (3,4) (previous head), then (4,4) (previous segment 1), then (4,3) (previous segment 2), etc.\n\n(4,3) is the third segment now, so occupied.\n\nSo moving to (4,3) causes collision.\n\nU to (3,4) collision.\n\nSo possible: D to (3,2), L to (2,3)\n\nR to (4,3) not possible.\n\nThird option on turn 19: L to (2,4)\n\n(2,4) free, no issue.\n\nThen new positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail moves to (5,1), (6,1) free with food.\n\nFrom (2,4), can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but (3,4) is now body, so collision.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFood at (2,6) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\nFood at (3,1) is at (3,1), which is currently free, but snake has (4,1) adjacent.\n\nTo eat (3,1), we need to move head there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) is now exposed after tail moves, but head is far.\n\nNow, since we need to think long-term, let's consider the options for turn 19.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,5)\n\nThen on turn 20, from (3,5), we can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5)\n\nIf L to (2,5), then from (2,5), we can go to (2,6) but (2,6) has food? But life span: at turn 19, (2,6) countdown 2, after turn 19 not eaten, on turn 20 countdown 1, so if we go to (2,6) on turn 20, we can eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 20, if we go L to (2,5), then on turn 20 we are at (2,5), not (2,6). To eat on turn 20, we need to move to (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 20, we can only go to (2,5) or (4,5), not directly to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 20, we could go to (2,6) on turn 21, but on turn 21, the food would be gone, since after turn 20 it disappears.\n\nTurn 20: if we move to (2,6) on turn 20, we eat it if available.\n\nBut to move to (2,6) on turn 20, we need to be adjacent on turn 19 after action.\n\nAfter turn 19 U to (3,5), we are at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6); (3,5) to (2,6) is diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nSo from (3,5), we cannot move to (2,6) on turn 20; we can only go to (2,5) or (4,5).\n\nIf we go to (2,5) on turn 20, then (2,6) is adjacent, so on turn 21 we could move to (2,6), but turn 21 is after turn 20, so (2,6) is gone. After turn 20, it disappears, so on turn 21 it's not there.\n\nThus, impossible to eat (2,6). So we should forget about it.\n\nSimilarly for other options.\n\nSo focus on other foods.\n\nNow, food at (3,1) is close. From head (3,4), down to (3,3), then (3,2), then (3,1), but (3,1) has food.\n\nBut we can go directly if possible, but not adjacent.\n\nPath: for example, turn 19 D to (3,3), then turn 20 D to (3,2), then turn 21 D to (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,1) life span 7, so available until turn 25, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) is at tail, but tail moved after turn 19 to (5,1), so (6,1) has food.\n\nTo eat (6,1), we need head to move there.\n\nFrom current (3,4), it's far.\n\nBut we can plan to go there.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is blocking some areas.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nGrid: 8x8, borders walls, so inner 6x6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) blocked.\n\nAlso, snake occupies: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nAfter any move, the tail moves, so one cell freed.\n\nFood at (2,6), (3,1), (6,1) but (6,1) is occupied by snake now, but after move, it might be free.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, we should avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nSince head is at (3,4), and we have options.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,1) is directly below, so moving down might be good to get it soon.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nIf we move D to (3,3) on turn 19.\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  tail at (5,1), (6,1) free with food.\n\nFrom (3,3), on turn 20, we can move D to (3,2), or L to (2,3), or U to (3,4) but (3,4) body, collision, R to (4,3) but (4,3) body, collision.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf D to (3,2), then on turn 21 D to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nEating (3,1) on turn 21.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows, so length increases by 1, so when we eat, the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nWhen we eat food, on that turn, head moves to food cell, eats it, so length increases, and tail does not move, so the new segment is added at head, but since head moved to food, it's like the snake grows by one cell at the head position.\n\nAfter eating, the body moves as usual, but since tail didn't move, the new position is fixed.\n\nIn terms of positions, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the head is at that cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nFor example, on turn 21, if we move to (3,1) and eat, then positions: head at (3,1), and the previous positions: before move, head was at (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n\nAfter move to (3,1) and eat, new head (3,1), then the body: the first segment is the previous head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — so length 8 now.\n\nTail at (5,1).\n\nFood at (3,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, back to turn 19.\n\nIf we move L to (2,4) on turn 19.\n\nThen positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1), (6,1) free with food.\n\nFrom (2,4), on turn 20, can move U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), or R to (3,4) but (3,4) body, collision, so only U, D, L.\n\nIf we go U to (2,5), then from there we can access upper areas.\n\nBut food at (2,6) is gone soon, so not useful.\n\nFood at (3,1) is south, so moving down might be better.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,1).\n\n(6,1) has food, and after turn 19, tail moves, so it's free.\n\nTo eat it, we need head to go there.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (6,1) is |dx|=3, |dy|=3, so Manhattan distance 6, at least 6 moves.\n\nBut we can plan a path.\n\nSince it has life span 10, no rush.\n\nBut we might get it later.\n\nNow, another point: the body is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), which is the bottom row.\n\nIf we move down, we might get closer to (3,1).\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nFor example, if we move to (3,3) on turn 19, then to (3,2) on turn 20, then to (3,1) on turn 21 to eat.\n\nAfter that, we are at (3,1) with body behind: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nFrom (3,1), we can move: U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision; D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, death; L to (2,1); R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut (2,1) might be free, not wall.\n\nThen from there, we can go to other places.\n\nBut we might be trapped in the bottom-left corner.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), we can go U to (2,2), L to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so upper part might be accessible.\n\nBut we need to maximize score, so eating food is good.\n\nFood at (6,1) is available, so after eating (3,1), we can go right to (6,1).\n\nBut from (3,1), after eating on turn 21, we move to (2,1) on turn 22, then to (2,2) or (1,1), etc., to reach (6,1) which is far.\n\nIt might take many turns.\n\nIf we don't go down, we can go left or up to explore.\n\nBut food at (3,1) is easy to get.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) can be got later.\n\nBut let's consider the move to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nIf we go U to (3,5), then on turn 20, we can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf L to (2,5), then from (2,5), on turn 21, we can go U to (2,6) but (2,6) food gone, or D to (2,4), or L to (1,5), or R to (3,5) but (3,5) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 20 to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (3,5) (previous head), (3,4), etc.\n\nSo (3,5) is occupied, so cannot go R to (3,5).\n\nCan go U to (2,6) but wall or gone, (2,6) is y=6, not wall, but food gone after turn 20, so on turn 21, no food, but we can move there if empty.\n\n(2,6) should be empty now.\n\nBut no food.\n\nCan go D to (2,4), or L to (1,5).\n\nThen we are in the left side.\n\nFrom there, we can go down to (2,4), etc., but (3,1) food is there.\n\nBut it might take longer to reach (3,1) from (2,5) than from (3,3).\n\nFor example, from (2,5) to (3,1): need to go down to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then to (3,1) but (3,1) is not adjacent to (2,1), |dx|=1, |dy=0|, so adjacent.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1) is right.\n\nBut from (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (3,1), 5 moves, whereas from (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1) only 2 moves from turn 19 down.\n\nTurn 19 D to (3,3), turn 20 D to (3,2), turn 21 D to (3,1) eat.\n\nIf we go up, it takes more turns to get to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, for (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) is available longer.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival, but also maximize score, so we should eat available food.\n\nAnother food is at (6,1), which is positive.\n\nBut since it's under the tail initially, but after move, it's free.\n\nOn turn 19, if we move, tail moves, so (6,1) is free with food.\n\nHead is at (3,4), so we can go right and down.\n\nFor example, on turn 19, if we move R, but we cannot, because current direction L, moving R is opposite, not allowed, and also (4,4) is body.\n\nSo only U, D, L possible.\n\nIf we move L to (2,4), then we can go down to (2,3), (2,2), etc., or right, but right to (3,4) is body.\n\nFrom (2,4), after move, body at (3,4), so cannot go right immediately.\n\nSo from (2,4), can go down to (2,3), then to (2,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,1), it's far.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving down to (3,3) then (3,2) then (3,1) is fast for that food.\n\nThen after eating (3,1), we are at (3,1), and only move left to (2,1), then we can go up to (2,2), (2,3), etc., or left to (1,1), then up.\n\nBut we can also go to the right side for (6,1) food.\n\nBut from (2,1), to (3,1) but (3,1) is where we ate, so empty now, but we can move to (3,1) only if it's free, but after eating, it's part of snake, so on turn 21 after eating, head at (3,1), body at (3,2), (3,3), etc., so (3,1) is head, (3,2) is body, so from (3,1), we cannot move to (3,2), collision, only to (2,1) or (4,1) but (4,1) is body, or (3,0) wall, so only (2,1) as before.\n\nSo we move to (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nThen from (2,1), can go U to (2,2), or L to (1,1), or D to (2,0) wall, death, so U or L.\n\nIf U to (2,2), then to (2,3), (2,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,1), we need to go right, but from (2,2), we can go to (3,2), but (3,2) is body? After some moves, the body moves.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 19: move D to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  tail (5,1), (6,1) free with food.\n\nTurn 20: move D to (3,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  tail (4,1), (5,1) free? Tail was (5,1), moves to (4,1)? Previous positions: before turn 20, head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nAfter move to (3,2), head (3,2), then previous head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — so segments: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  length 7, tail at (4,1)\n\n(5,1) is free now, but no food there, food is at (6,1).\n\n(6,1) still has food.\n\nTurn 21: move D to (3,1) and eat food at (3,1), so grow, tail does not move.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then the previous body: since we ate, tail doesn't move, so body is (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — and we add a new segment at head? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,1), then the previous head becomes segment 1, which is (3,2), then segment 2 is previous segment 1, which was (3,3), and so on, up to tail at (4,1), but since tail didn't move, the last segment is still (4,1), and we have one more segment.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)  tail (4,1)\n\nAfter eating at (3,1): head moves to (3,1), so new head (3,1), then the first body segment is the previous head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so (4,1) is still there, and we have 8 segments: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nFood at (3,1) eaten, removed.\n\nNow, from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision; D to (3,0) wall; L to (2,1); R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision. So only L to (2,1).\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,1)\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  tail at (4,2)? Previous positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nAfter move to (2,1), head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail at (4,2), (4,1) is free now.\n\nFood at (6,1) still there.\n\nFrom (2,1), can move U to (2,2), or L to (1,1), or D to (2,0) wall, so U or L.\n\nSay U to (2,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we can see that to reach (6,1), it will take many turns, and the snake is long, so we might have space issues.\n\nFor example, the upper left area might be tight.\n\nBut let's see the grid size: 6x6 playable area minus obstacles and snake.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except (3,6) obstacle.\n\nSo 36 -1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 7, but after eating (3,1), length 8.\n\nThen more cells occupied.\n\nBut there are foods to eat.\n\nNow, back to turn 19, if we move L to (2,4), then we can go down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), then to (3,1) to eat on turn 22 or something, later than if we go down now.\n\nTurn 19 L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20, say D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 21 D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 22 D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 23 R to (3,1) eat.\n\nWhereas if down now, eat on turn 21, so sooner.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, it takes even longer.\n\nSo for efficiency, moving down to get (3,1) soon is better.\n\nThen we can think about (6,1) later.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (6,1) with life span 10, so we have time.\n\nBut when we eat (3,1), the tail is at (4,1), and (6,1) is free with food, so we can go there.\n\nBut from (3,1), after eating, we can only go to (2,1), then from there, we can go to (1,1), or up to (2,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,1), we need to go right, but the body is blocking.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), we can go to (3,1) but it's occupied after we move, or to (4,1) but (4,1) is body.\n\nAfter turn 22 when we move to (2,1), positions as above, (4,1) is free, but no food.\n\n(6,1) has food.\n\nSo from (2,1), we can go up to (2,2), then to (3,2), but (3,2) is body? In the positions after turn 22 move to (2,1), body includes (3,2), so occupied.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied, (4,2) occupied.\n\nSo from (2,1), move U to (2,2) (free), then from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), or L to (1,2), or R to (3,2) but (3,2) body, collision, so U or L.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc., but it's slow to go to the right.\n\nThe only way to the right is to go up and then right from above, but there is an obstacle at (3,6), so we might go around.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), to (2,3), to (2,4), but (2,4) might be free later.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps on turn 19, we should move in a way that allows us to access the right side.\n\nFor example, if we move U to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nThen from (3,5), turn 20 move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nSay L to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), turn 21 move D to (2,4) (since U to (2,6) no food, or L to (1,5), or D to (2,4)).\n\nThen from (2,4), turn 22 move D to (2,3), and so on to (2,1), then to (3,1) later.\n\nStill slower than going down directly.\n\nIf on turn 20 from (3,5) we go R to (4,5), then from (4,5), we can go U but (4,6) may be wall or free; y=6 not wall, but (4,6) free? No snake, not obstacle, so U to (4,6).\n\nOr D to (4,4) but (4,4) body, collision, so from (4,5), after turn 20, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,4) is body, so moving D to (4,4) collision.\n\nL to (3,5) body, collision.\n\nR to (5,5)\n\nU to (4,6)\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf U to (4,6), then we are at top.\n\nBut food at (3,1) is south, so far.\n\nNot efficient for eating.\n\nSo to maximize score, eating the close food (3,1) soon is better, then we can plan for (6,1).\n\nBut after eating (3,1), we are a bit trapped, but we can escape by going left and up.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), go to (1,1), then (1,2), etc., to the left side, then up, then right to (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) life span 10, turn 19 to turn 28, so we have time.\n\nTurn 19: countdown 10, so available from turn 19 to turn 28 (countdown 1 on turn 28, gone after).\n\nTurn 19: countdown 10\n\nTurn 20:9\n\n...\n\nTurn 28: countdown 1, gone after turn 28.\n\nSo we have until turn 28 to eat it.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, no other food.\n\nSo perhaps on turn 19, move D to (3,3) to start going down.\n\nThen turn 20 D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 21 D to (3,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 22 L to (2,1)\n\nFrom there, we can go to the left or up.\n\nBut to eat (6,1), we can go up first to have space.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), turn 22 move U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 23 U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 24 U to (2,4)  (but (2,4) might be free)\n\nTurn 25 U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 26 U to (2,6) but (2,6) no food, or to (1,6) etc.\n\nThen from (2,5), we can go right to (3,5), but (3,5) may be free, then to (4,5), etc., down to (6,1).\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince the body will move, some cells free up.\n\nBut to save turns, perhaps after eating (3,1), we can go directly right if possible, but it's blocked.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 19, move L to (2,4), then turn 20 move D to (2,3), turn 21 D to (2,2), turn 22 D to (2,1), turn 23 R to (3,1) eat, same as before but later.\n\nOr from (2,4), turn 20 move U to (2,5), then we are up, but not helping for food.\n\nSo moving down immediately seems best for (3,1).\n\nMoreover, by moving down, we free up the top area for later movement.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,1) can be eaten when we go there.\n\nBut there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut now, tail is at (6,1), and head at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nAfter we move, tail moves to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc., so it changes.\n\nWhen we approach (6,1), the tail might not be there.\n\nFor example, if we go to eat (6,1) later, the tail will have moved.\n\nBut since we eat it, we grow, so the new tail position might cause collision if not careful.\n\nBut in this case, since we eat at (6,1), and if the tail is adjacent, but after eating, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail position when tail is there, but tail moves away before head arrives? No.\n\nTo eat the food at (6,1), we need to move head to (6,1) when it is free.\n\nAt that time, if the tail is adjacent, and we eat, we grow, so the new tail is where the head was, and the old tail is still there, so if the old tail was adjacent, the new head and new tail might be adjacent or something.\n\nLet's read the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nThe tail cell has food, meaning the cell where the tail is has food.\n\nSo when the head moves to that cell to eat, if at that time the tail is adjacent to the head (before move), then after eating, the new tail (which is the previous head position) might be adjacent to the head, causing collision.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSuppose at some turn, the tail is at P, with food, and head is at Q adjacent to P.\n\nThen if we move head to P to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving, head is at P, and since we ate, the tail does not move, so the previous tail is still at P? No.\n\nBefore the move: tail at P with food, head at Q adjacent.\n\nWe move head to P.\n\nDuring the move: head moves to P, which has food, so we eat it. The body moves: the segment behind head moves to Q, and so on, but the tail: since we ate, the tail does not move, so the tail remains at its position, which is P, but head is moving to P, so collision? No.\n\nThe tail is at P, and head is moving to P, so when head moves to P, it is the same cell as tail, so collision, death, even without eating consideration.\n\nBut the rule says \"the body moves away\" for food under body, but for tail, it's special.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to a cell occupied by tail, it collides, because tail is body.\n\nThe rule \"Tail Reward Danger\" is for when the food is under the tail, and the body moves away, so the cell is free, but if head is adjacent and moves to it, and tail was adjacent, then after eating, the new position might have head and new tail adjacent.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nFor tail, when the tail moves away, the food is exposed, and head can move to it later.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, this is a specific danger when the head is adjacent to the tail and that tail cell has food.\n\nThen, if you eat it, after eating, the head is at the tail position, and the new tail is the previous head position, which is adjacent, so they are next to each other, and depending on movement, it might collide later, but the rule says it kills immediately, I think.\n\nThe rule says \"eating it kills the snake\", so probably it's invalid or causes death.\n\nIn this state, currently, head at (3,4), tail at (6,1), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nLater, when we approach, we need to ensure that when we eat (6,1), the head is not adjacent to the tail at that time.\n\nBut since the tail moves, we can time it.\n\nFor now, not an issue.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nI think for turn 19, moving down to (3,3) is good to get the food at (3,1) quickly.\n\nThen we can plan the next moves.\n\nSimilarly, for the answer, I need to provide multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions for several turns, starting from t1=19.\n\nSo let's decide for turn 19, 20, 21 at least.\n\nTurn 19: move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,3), move D to (3,2) (since other moves may not be better)\n\nThen turn 21: move D to (3,1) and eat.\n\nThen after that, we need to move, only possible L to (2,1) on turn 22.\n\nBut we can decide up to there.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is expiring, but we can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nAnother option: on turn 19, move L to (2,4), then we can go down or up, but for (3,1), it's slower.\n\nOr move U to (3,5), then we can go to (2,5) or (4,5), but not towards food.\n\nSo D seems best.\n\nMoreover, by moving down, we keep the left option open.\n\nSo I think turn 19: D\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,3), only safe moves are D or L.\n\nIf we go D to (3,2), then to (3,1) on turn 21.\n\nIf we go L to (2,3), then we are at (2,3), then we can go to (2,2), etc., to (2,1), then to (3,1), but it takes one more turn.\n\nFor example, turn 19 D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20 L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 21 D to (2,2) or to (2,1) if possible, but not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1).\n\nSo turn 21 to (2,2), turn 22 to (2,1), turn 23 to (3,1) eat, whereas with down, eat on turn 21.\n\nSo better to go down directly.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 20, from (3,3), move D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 21 D to (3,1) eat.\n\nThen for turn 22, from (3,1), only move L to (2,1).\n\nWe can output these.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so perhaps plan further.\n\nAfter turn 22 at (2,1), we can go U to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 22 or so.\n\nThe format doesn't specify how many turns, but at least for the immediate actions.\n\nPerhaps for 3 turns.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect, but not immediately.\n\nI think moving down is fine.\n\nSo for turn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 21: D (to (3,1) and eat)\n\nThen after that, turn 22: L (to (2,1))\n\nBut we can stop there or continue.\n\nSince the food at (6,1) is there, we can plan to go there.\n\nBut for now, I think this is reasonable.\n\nTo maximize, after eating (3,1), we can go up and right to (6,1).\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Value +1, life span 2 (available only until turn 20). However, from the current head position (3,4), it is impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 20 due to the Manhattan distance of 3 and orthogonal movement constraints. Thus, this food will expire uneaten and can be ignored.\n- **Food at (3,1)**: Value +1, life span 7 (available until turn 25). This is easily reachable in 2 moves by moving down, allowing us to eat it on turn 21 for a +1 score and length increase.\n- **Food at (6,1)**: Value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 28), currently under the tail. After any move, the tail moves away, exposing the food. However, it is far from the head, and eating it requires careful planning to avoid the \"Tail Reward Danger\" (not an immediate risk). Given the long life span, we can delay pursuing this food until after eating (3,1).\n- **Movement constraints**: Current head direction is left (L), so moving right (R) is forbidden (instant reverse) and would cause collision with the body at (4,4). Safe moves from (3,4) are up (U) to (3,5), down (D) to (3,3), or left (L) to (2,4). Moving down directly toward (3,1) is efficient for scoring.\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating (3,1) on turn 21, the snake will be at (3,1) with limited moves (only left to (2,1) is safe). From there, we can navigate left and up to avoid dead ends and eventually reach (6,1) for another +1 score. The grid has sufficient space (35 free cells after accounting for walls and obstacles), and the snake length (7 now, 8 after eating) is manageable with careful pathing.\n\n### Turn-by-Turn Plan (5+ turns)\n- **Turn 19**: Move down (D) to (3,3). This starts the path toward (3,1) and avoids risky areas. (Current direction L allows D; moving U or L would delay eating (3,1).)\n- **Turn 20**: Move down (D) to (3,2). From (3,3), moving down is safe and continues toward (3,1); moving left (to (2,3)) would add unnecessary turns.\n- **Turn 21**: Move down (D) to (3,1) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 8). Snake positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1); tail at (4,1). Food at (3,1) is consumed.\n- **Turn 22**: Move left (L) to (2,1). From (3,1), only left is safe (up, down, and right cause collisions or walls). This opens paths upward.\n- **Turn 23**: Move up (U) to (2,2). From (2,1), moving up avoids the bottom row and starts navigation toward the right side for (6,1). Left to (1,1) is also safe but less efficient for reaching (6,1).\n- **Beyond**: Continue toward (6,1) via e.g., (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (3,4) (if clear) → ... to (6,1), eating by turn 28. Monitor for \"Tail Reward Danger\" when adjacent to tail.\n\nThis plan scores +1 by turn 21, with a path to another +1 at (6,1) later. It avoids all immediate risks and ensures long-term survival by not trapping the snake.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: D (down)\nTurn 20: D (down)\nTurn 21: D (down)\nTurn 22: L (left)\nTurn 23: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to avoid the internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t=20.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), then body segments: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake is 7 segments long.\n\nHead direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downward.\n\nFood items:\n\n1. (2,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if not eaten on turn 20, it vanishes.\n\n2. (3,1) with value 1 and life span 6. So it will last until turn 25 (20 + 6 - 1? Let me think: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it disappears after t + L - 1? No.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nFor example, at turn 20, life span 1: it is available on turn 20 only. If not eaten, it disappears before turn 21.\n\nLife span 1: present only on turn t, gone after.\n\nLife span 2: present on turn t and t+1, gone after t+1.\n\nGenerally, food with life span L at turn t will be available from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor (2,6): life span 1 at turn 20, so only available now on turn 20. Must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\n(3,1): life span 6, available from turn 20 to turn 25 inclusive (turns 20,21,22,23,24,25), since 20 + 6 - 1 = 25? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 20: life span 6, countdown 6 (decreases to 5 after turn 20)\n\nAfter turn 20, life span becomes 5 for turn 21, and so on, until life span 1 on turn 25, then disappears after turn 25.\n\nSo available from turn 20 to 25.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1): life span 9, available from turn 20 to 28.\n\nNow, head is at (3,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U on the next turn? No, the rule is \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so on the very next move, I cannot move U (up), because that would be instant reverse.\n\nBut I can move L, R, or D? D is same direction, which should be fine.\n\nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for turn t=20, since head direction is D, I cannot choose U for the action on turn 20? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Snake Head Direction\": given as D, meaning the direction it moved to get to current position, I assume.\n\nSo on turn 20, the snake just moved to (3,3) with direction D, meaning it came from above? Positions: snake positions are given in order: head at (3,3), then (3,4), which is above (3,3), so yes, it moved down to (3,3) from (3,4).\n\nSo current head direction is D, so for the next move, turn 20 action, I cannot move U, because that would be opposite.\n\nPossible actions: since direction is D, I can move D (continue down), L (left), or R (right), but not U.\n\nNow, grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries. And internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6).\n\nSnake body: positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (3,3): head\n\n- (3,4): body\n\n- (4,4): body\n\n- (4,3): body\n\n- (4,2): body\n\n- (4,1): body\n\n- (5,1): tail\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (2,6): value +1, must eat now or lose\n\n- (3,1): value +1, life 6, so can eat later\n\n- (6,1): value +1, life 9, can eat later\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, immediate options for turn 20.\n\nHead at (3,3), can move:\n\n- D: down to (3,2)\n\n- L: left to (2,3)\n\n- R: right to (4,3)\n\nCannot move U because opposite to current D direction.\n\nNow, check if these moves are safe.\n\n(3,2): is it occupied or wall? Snake body: look at positions, (4,3) is at (4,3), (4,2) is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). (3,2) is not listed, so not occupied. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,2) is within 1-6,1-6. Not (3,6) obstacle. So (3,2) is free? But is it a food position? Food are at (2,6), (3,1), (6,1), so no food at (3,2). So moving to (3,2) is safe, no collision.\n\n(2,3): similarly, not occupied by snake, not wall, not food, so safe.\n\n(4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by body! Snake positions include (4,3) as a body segment. Head is at (3,3), moving to (4,3) would collide with body segment at (4,3).\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nSo (4,3) is the fourth segment, which is body. If head moves to (4,3), it would be on the same cell as body, causing collision.\n\nUnless the body moves away, but in this case, when head moves, the tail moves only after the head moves to a new cell.\n\nCollision rule: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for (4,3), is it the tail? Tail is at (5,1), so (4,3) is not tail, it's a body segment, so moving to (4,3) would cause collision because head touches body.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is also body, but we're not moving there.\n\nFor moving to (4,3): it is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so collision.\n\nTherefore, moving R to (4,3) is not possible, it's deadly.\n\nSo only possible moves from (3,3) are D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n\nNow, food at (2,6) must be eaten this turn or it disappears. But (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nCurrent head at (3,3). To reach (2,6) in one move? (2,6) is not adjacent to (3,3). Adjacent cells: (3,3) to (2,3) left, (4,3) right, (3,2) down, (3,4) up. But (3,4) is body, cannot move there.\n\n(2,6) is at distance, so impossible to eat this turn. Therefore, (2,6) will be lost if not eaten now, and since we can't reach it, we lose it. Life span 1, only this turn.\n\nSo (2,6) is not achievable; we must let it disappear.\n\nNow, other food: (3,1) and (6,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,1) and (5,1) are at y=1, but (4,1) is body, (5,1) is tail. (3,1) is a food position, but is it under snake?\n\nFood can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (3,1) has food, but snake has segment at (4,1), which is adjacent? Let's see.\n\n(3,1) is a cell, and snake has (4,1) and (5,1), but (3,1) itself is not occupied by snake; it has food.\n\nSnake positions do not include (3,1), so (3,1) is free but with food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is free with food.\n\nFor (3,1): it is at (3,1), and we have body at (4,1), which is adjacent.\n\nBut to eat (3,1), we need to move head there when it's accessible.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 moves.\n\nHead at (3,3), can move to (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nIf I move D to (3,2): new head position (3,2), direction down.\n\nThen snake will be: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and tail (5,1) will move? When head moves to new cell, the tail end is removed, so the snake grows only if it eats food.\n\nNo food at (3,2), so no eat, so tail is removed. Current snake length 7, positions: after move, head to (3,2), so new positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] and (5,1) is removed? Let's see the order.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: tail (5,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,2) without eating, new head is (3,2), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all body segments move forward, so the tail end is removed if no growth.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,2), then the previous head (3,3) becomes first body, then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and the tail (5,1) is removed, so snake is now from (3,2) to (4,1), length 6? Positions: head (3,2), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and (4,1) is now the last body? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (3,2):\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- Then the previous positions except tail: so segment 0 was (3,3), now body at (3,3)\n\nSegment 1: (3,4) now at (3,4)\n\nSegment 2: (4,4) now at (4,4)\n\nSegment 3: (4,3) now at (4,3)\n\nSegment 4: (4,2) now at (4,2)\n\nSegment 5: (4,1) now at (4,1), and segment 6: (5,1) removed.\n\nBut segment 5 was (4,1), which is now the last segment, tail at (4,1).\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] so tail at (4,1), length 7? No: original had 7 segments, after moving without eating, length should be the same, but tail removed.\n\nOriginal: 7 segments.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell, all segments move, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so new snake has same length, positions: new head at (3,2), then the first body segment is the old head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and the old segment 5 (4,1) is now the new tail? Index:\n\nOld: 0:(3,3) head, 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(5,1) tail\n\nAfter move down to (3,2) no eat:\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- New body: old 0 becomes (3,3), old 1 becomes (3,4), old 2 becomes (4,4), old 3 becomes (4,3), old 4 becomes (4,2), old 5 becomes (4,1), and old 6 (5,1) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] so 7 segments? But (4,1) is now the tail, and (5,1) is gone. But length is still 7 because we didn't grow, but we removed the tail cell, so it should be 6 segments.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStandard: snake has N segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the new snake has N segments: the new head and the first N-1 body segments from the old list.\n\nOld snake: segments S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{N-1} with S0 head.\n\nAfter moving to new cell P:\n\n- New head at P\n\n- New body: S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{N-2}  (so the first N-1 old segments, but S0 becomes the first body, etc.)\n\nNew positions: P (head), S0 (body), S1 (body), ..., S_{N-2} (body), and S_{N-1} is removed, so length N.\n\nIn this case, N=7, old: S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,3), S4=(4,2), S5=(4,1), S6=(5,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,2) no eat:\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew body: S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,3), S4=(4,2), S5=(4,1)  -- S5 is now the tail, since S6 removed.\n\nSo positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] tail at (4,1), length 7.\n\nBut (4,1) was previously occupied, and now it's the tail. The cell (5,1) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if we move left to (2,3) no eat:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nNew body: S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,3), S4=(4,2), S5=(4,1)  so positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] tail at (4,1)\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nNow, back to turn 20.\n\nOptions: move D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n\n(2,6) food is not reachable, so we lose it.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to eat other food.\n\nFood at (3,1) and (6,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is currently occupied? No, (3,1) is a food position, not snake. Snake has (4,1) and (5,1), but (3,1) is free with food.\n\nTo eat (3,1), we need to move head to (3,1) when it's not blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) at (6,1), free with food.\n\nNow, head at (3,3), if I move D to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n\nCan move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\n(3,1) has food, value +1.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,1), what is the tail?\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,1).\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) on turn 20, tail is at (4,1), as above.\n\nThen on turn 21, from (3,2), move D to (3,1).\n\nHead moves to (3,1), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nNow, when I eat, the tail does not move, so new snake: head at (3,1), then the previous head (3,2) becomes body, then S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,3), S4=(4,2), S5=(4,1), and since I ate, tail stays, so S5=(4,1) is still there, and I add a new segment, so positions: new head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) and the tail is still (4,1)? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nOld positions before move: let's say after turn 20 move to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail.\n\nNow on turn 21, move to (3,1) which has food.\n\nNew head at (3,1)\n\nThen new body: the old head (3,2) becomes first body, then old body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and old tail (4,1) remains as tail, and since I ate, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail is now the new segment at (4,1), but it's the same cell? No.\n\nStandard: when eating, head moves to new cell, all body segments stay, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail is extended.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,1), then body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and the old tail (4,1) is still there, and a new segment is added at (4,1), so now (4,1) has two segments? No.\n\nWhen you eat, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, meaning the tail stays, and the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo from old: segments: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) with head (3,2) and tail (4,1)\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) and eating:\n\n- New head: (3,1)\n\n- The old head (3,2) becomes new body\n\n- The old body segments: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) all remain as body\n\n- The old tail (4,1) remains as tail, and since eating, a new segment is added at the tail position, so now there is a new tail at (4,1), but it's the same cell, so the tail stays, and the new segment is the old tail, so positions: head (3,1), then body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) -- now 8 segments.\n\nThe cell (4,1) is occupied by the tail.\n\nNow, in this case, when I move to (3,1), the head is at (3,1), tail is at (4,1), which is adjacent: (3,1) and (4,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nNow, the food was at (3,1), which I ate, so the tail cell (4,1) has no food; the food was at (3,1), which is now head.\n\nThe danger is if the tail cell has food and I eat it while head adjacent to tail.\n\nBut here, the food was at (3,1), not at tail cell.\n\nTail cell is (4,1), which may or may not have food, but in this case, (4,1) is not a food position; food is at (3,1), (6,1), etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating, tail at (4,1), head at (3,1), adjacent, but no food on tail cell, so safe.\n\nBut the danger rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (3,1), the tail cell is (4,1), which has no food, so no danger.\n\nSo eating (3,1) should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the position.\n\nFrom (3,2) move to (3,1): (3,1) is free except for the food, which I eat.\n\nBody: after turn 20 move to (3,2), positions include (4,1) as tail, so when I move to (3,1), I am not colliding with body because (3,1) is not occupied by body; only (4,1) is tail, but (3,1) is adjacent, not the same cell.\n\nCollision only if head moves to a cell occupied by body, except if it's the tail cell.\n\n(3,1) is not occupied, so safe to move there.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows, tail at (4,1).\n\nNow, back to turn 20 choices.\n\nOption 1: move D to (3,2) on turn 20.\n\nThen on turn 21, I can move D to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut is (3,1) still there? Food (3,1) has life span 6, available until turn 25, so yes.\n\nFrom (3,2), I could move other directions, but eating (3,1) is possible.\n\nOption 2: move L to (2,3) on turn 20.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move R (right) because opposite to current L? Current direction after move is L, so on next turn cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but R is opposite to current L, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, (3,3) is body, so cannot move there anyway.\n\n(2,4): is it free? Snake has (3,4) and (4,4), but (2,4) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\n(2,2): not occupied, free.\n\n(1,3): x=1, not wall, free.\n\nBut no food nearby immediately.\n\nNow, to reach (3,1), from (2,3), I need to go down or something.\n\nBut (3,1) is below.\n\nI should think about the grid and plan a path.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,1), which is at the bottom right.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block paths.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should simulate possible sequences.\n\nFirst, let's list all food and their expiry:\n\n- (2,6): life 1, only turn 20, cannot reach, lost.\n\n- (3,1): life 6, available turns 20 to 25 (since disappears after turn 25)\n\n- (6,1): life 9, available turns 20 to 28\n\nNow, snake head at (3,3).\n\nIf I move D to (3,2) on turn 20, then to (3,1) on turn 21 to eat it.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,1), snake longer.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 20, then I might not eat (3,1) soon, and it might be riskier or something.\n\nBut (3,1) has only until turn 25, 6 turns, but I can eat it later if I don't now.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nGrid: let's sketch a mental grid.\n\nRows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, but y=0 and y=7 walls, etc., so playable y=1 to 6, x=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so we can only be on x=1-6, y=1-6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions turn 20:\n\nHead (3,3)\n\nBody: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nSo occupied: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nFree cells except food.\n\nFood at (2,6), (3,1), (6,1)\n\n(3,1) is free, (6,1) free, (2,6) free but will be gone.\n\nAfter turn 20, (2,6) gone.\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,2) on turn 20:\n\n- Turn 20: move D to (3,2), no eat, so new positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail. Direction D.\n\n- Turn 21: from (3,2), can move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1) has food, so if I move D to (3,1), eat it, grow.\n\nNew head (3,1), then body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) with new segment, so positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail (4,1). Length 8.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nD to (3,0) but y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nL to (2,1), or R to (4,1)\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, is it wall? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is not wall, x=2 not wall, so (2,1) free? But is it occupied? Snake has body at (3,2), (3,3), etc., (4,1) is tail, (2,1) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is tail, so I can move to (4,1) because it's the tail.\n\nRule: can move to tail cell because tail will move.\n\nBut if I move to (4,1), and it has food? (4,1) has no food; food was at (3,1), eaten.\n\nSo (4,1) is tail, moving there is safe, but no food, so no grow, tail moves.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nAlso, from (3,1), after moving D to there, direction D, so for next move, cannot move U (up) because opposite to D.\n\nPossible: L, R, or D but D to (3,0) wall, impossible.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nIf move to (4,1), which is tail, so safe, no eat, so tail moves: new head (4,1), then body (3,1), (3,2), etc., tail removed, so positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and old (4,2) is last body? After growth, positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail (4,1)\n\nIf move to (4,1): head to (4,1), which is current tail, so since it's tail, no collision, and no food, so no grow, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then body: old head (3,1) becomes body, then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and old (4,2) is now tail? Old segments: after growth, S0: head (3,1), S1: (3,2), S2: (3,3), S3: (3,4), S4: (4,4), S5: (4,3), S6: (4,2), S7: tail (4,1)\n\nMove to (4,1): (4,1) is S7, tail.\n\nNew head at (4,1), then new body: S0=(3,1), S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), S3=(3,4), S4=(4,4), S5=(4,3), S6=(4,2), and S7 removed? No, S7 is the cell we're moving to.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, then since tail moves, it's safe, and the new tail is the previous segment.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,1), then the old head (3,1) becomes first body, then S1=(3,2), S2=(3,3), S3=(3,4), S4=(4,4), S5=(4,3), S6=(4,2), and since no eat, the old tail (4,1) is gone, so new tail is S6=(4,2).\n\nPositions: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] and tail at (4,3)? S6=(4,2) is the last, so positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and (4,2) is not included? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter eating at (3,1), positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,1) tail\n\nMove to (4,1) on turn 22: new head at (4,1), which is old index 7.\n\nSince no food at (4,1), no eat, so new positions: new head (4,1), then old 0 (3,1) becomes body, old 1 (3,2) body, old 2 (3,3) body, old 3 (3,4) body, old 4 (4,4) body, old 5 (4,3) body, old 6 (4,2) body, and old 7 (4,1) is removed, so new tail is old 6 (4,2).\n\nSo positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3)? Old 5 is (4,3), old 6 is (4,2), so new body includes old 0 to old 6, so positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail at (4,3)? (4,3) is listed twice? No:\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nThen new body segments: the old positions from index 0 to 6: but index 0 is (3,1), index 1 is (3,2), index 2 is (3,3), index 3 is (3,4), index 4 is (4,4), index 5 is (4,3), index 6 is (4,2)\n\nSo new body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nThen tail at (4,2)\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is tail.\n\nBut earlier I thought (4,3) but no.\n\nAnyway, it's messy, but I don't need to simulate all, just for collision.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf on turn 20 I move D to (3,2), then turn 21 I can eat (3,1) by moving D.\n\nThen I have the food.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 20, then from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or U to (2,4) or L to (1,3), but not R.\n\nThen to reach (3,1), I need to go down to (2,2) then (2,1) or something, but (3,1) is at x=3, so I might need to move right later, but from (2,2) I can move R to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut it might take more turns, and (3,1) might be eaten later, but since it's available until turn 25, I have time.\n\nBut let's see the other food at (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is at bottom right.\n\nAlso, there might be risks of trapping myself.\n\nThe snake is currently in the left-bottom area, with body above.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), the snake is around (3,1) to (4,4), but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the long-term.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks the top row.\n\ny=6 is the top, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall, so y=6 is high row.\n\n(3,6) blocked.\n\nNow, food at (6,1) is at bottom right.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both foods.\n\nBut (3,1) is close, so eating it soon is good.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 21, it might be harder later.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (2,3) on turn 20, then I am at (2,3), then I might go to (2,2), (2,1), then to (3,1), but from (2,1) to (3,1) is possible, but (3,1) might be under something, but it's free.\n\nBut when I move to (3,1), the tail might be elsewhere.\n\nBut it should be fine.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger.\n\nFor instance, if the tail is at a cell with food and head adjacent, eating that food is dangerous.\n\nBut in this case, for (3,1), the tail is not on it, so no problem.\n\nNow, another food at (6,1).\n\nIf I eat (3,1) soon, then I can head to (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving D on turn 20 to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 21, move D to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nNew head (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 22, from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1), since U and D not possible or dangerous.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, impossible.\n\nU to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, cannot move.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nMove L to (2,1): new head (2,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nMove R to (4,1): (4,1) is tail, but after eating, tail is at (4,1), so moving to (4,1) is safe, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nThen head at (4,1), etc.\n\nBut from (4,1), I can go to (5,1) or (4,2), but (4,2) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) on turn 22, positions as above.\n\nThen from (4,1), direction R (since moved right from (3,1)? From (3,1) to (4,1) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 23, from (4,1), can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (left) because opposite to R? Current direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, R to (5,1), L impossible.\n\n(4,2) is body, occupied, cannot move.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) is free? Snake positions: after turn 22 move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nSo (5,1) not occupied, free. Also, food at (6,1) is at (6,1), so (5,1) is adjacent to (6,1).\n\nSo I can move to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go to (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 20: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 21: move D to (3,1) eat, grow\n\nTurn 22: move R to (4,1)  (since from (3,1) to (4,1) is right, direction R)\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2)  -- as above.\n\nTurn 23: from (4,1), can move R to (5,1) (since direction R, cannot move L, U to (4,2) occupied, D impossible)\n\nMove R to (5,1), no food, so new head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2) removed, so new tail at (4,3)? Positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail. (4,2) removed.\n\nThen turn 24: from (5,1), direction R (moved right), can move R to (6,1), which has food, eat it.\n\nMove to (6,1), eat, grow.\n\nNew head (6,1), then body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail at (4,3) with new segment, so tail at (4,3).\n\nThen I have eaten both foods by turn 24.\n\nBut is this safe? Let's check collisions.\n\nTurn 20: move to (3,2), free, safe.\n\nTurn 21: move to (3,1), free except food, eat, safe.\n\nTurn 22: move to (4,1), which was tail, but after growth, it was body? After turn 21, positions include (4,1) as tail, but when I move to (4,1) on turn 22, it is the tail cell, so safe to move there since tail moves.\n\nNo collision.\n\nTurn 23: move to (5,1), free, safe.\n\nTurn 24: move to (6,1), free, eat, safe.\n\nSo I get two foods quickly.\n\nIf I had moved L on turn 20, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,3) on turn 20.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 21: from (2,3), can move D to (2,2), U to (2,4), L to (1,3), but not R.\n\nSay move D to (2,2), no food.\n\nNew head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail? After turn 20 move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (5,1) removed? Original after move: head (2,3), then S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,3), S4=(4,2), S5=(4,1), tail at (4,1) since (5,1) removed.\n\nLength 7.\n\nThen turn 21 move to (2,2), no food, new head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail (4,1)\n\nThen turn 22: from (2,2), direction D (since moved down from (2,3)? From (2,3) to (2,2) is down, so direction D.\n\nCan move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2), but not U.\n\n(2,1) free, (1,2) free, (3,2) is body? Positions: (4,2) is body, (3,2) not listed, so free? Positions have (4,2) at x=4,y=2, (3,2) is not occupied, so free.\n\nMove to (2,1) or (3,2) or (1,2).\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (2,2), move D to (2,1), then to (3,1) but (3,1) is at (3,1), from (2,1) I can move R to (3,1) on turn 23.\n\nBut (3,1) food available until turn 25, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, then to (6,1).\n\nBut it takes more turns: turn 20: L to (2,3), turn 21: D to (2,2), turn 22: D to (2,1), turn 23: R to (3,1) eat, then from there to (6,1) similarly.\n\nBut compared to the first sequence, I eat (3,1) on turn 21 vs turn 23, so earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) on turn 24 vs later.\n\nIn the first sequence, I eat (3,1) on turn 21 and (6,1) on turn 24.\n\nIn this, (3,1) on turn 23, then (6,1) say turn 25 or so.\n\nSo better to eat sooner to have more options.\n\nMoreover, in the first sequence, by moving D on turn 20, I can eat both quickly.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle? It's at (3,6), not in the way for this path.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: after eating both, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after head at (6,1), I can go up or left.\n\nBut I should think 5+ turns.\n\nSince the prompt says to think 5+ turns ahead, but I don't need to output all, just the actions for the next few turns, but I need to decide based on long-term.\n\nIn the first choice, moving D on turn 20 leads to eating food soon.\n\nIf I move L, it delays.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat (3,1), in the first sequence, head at (3,1), then I move R to (4,1), which was tail, safe.\n\nIn the alternative, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving to (4,1) on turn 22 is necessary; I could move L to (2,1) instead, but then I might not go directly to (6,1).\n\nBut moving R is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go to other areas.\n\nBut since (6,1) is a food, I should eat it.\n\nNow, about the tail danger: in this path, no tail cell has food when eaten.\n\nFor example, (3,1) was eaten, tail was at (4,1), no food.\n\n(6,1) eaten, tail was at (4,3) or something, no food.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, moving D on turn 20 seems best.\n\nBut on turn 20, I have two choices, but moving R to (4,3) is impossible, as it's body.\n\nOnly D or L.\n\nAnd D is better for immediate food.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake is longer, but I have space.\n\nAnother point: the grid has an obstacle at (3,6), which might affect if I go up, but for now, I'm going down and right.\n\nAfter turn 24, head at (6,1), I can consider going up, like to (6,2), etc., to explore.\n\nBut since no more food now, I need to survive.\n\nBut food might respawn, but in this game, food positions are given, and I think no new food, only these until eaten or expired.\n\nThe state has fixed food, I assume no respawn, only these.\n\nSo after eating both, no more food, but I need to survive to keep score.\n\nBut the game continues, I think, but with no food, score doesn't increase, but I avoid death.\n\nIn the context, I think we play until death or something, but the goal is to maximize score, so after eating all, I should just survive.\n\nBut since no time limit, I can keep moving forever if possible.\n\nBut in this grid, with walls and obstacle, I need to check if it's possible to have an infinite path.\n\nFor example, the grid is 6x6 minus (3,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length after eating both foods: initially 7, eat two +1 each, so length 9.\n\nAfter turn 24, length 9, with 35 cells, so plenty of space.\n\nI can move around.\n\nBut with the obstacle, some paths might be blocked.\n\nBut I can find a Hamiltonian path or something, but not necessary.\n\nFor now, eating the foods quickly is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 20, I should move D.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D to eat (3,1)\n\nTurn 22: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 23: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 24: R to (6,1) eat\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nCurrent turn t1=20, so I need to output actions for turn 20, 21, 22, ... but how many?\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nProbably I need to output for a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", perhaps output 5 actions or so.\n\nBut in the boxed answer, I should provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can provide the actions until I eat or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output for the next 5 turns.\n\nTurn 20 to 24.\n\nBut on turn 22 and 23, no eat, but moving.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 20: D, turn 21: D, turn 22: R, turn 23: R, turn 24: R.\n\nBut after that, I need to keep moving.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 24.\n\nSince the food (2,6) is lost anyway, and I eat others.\n\nBut is there a reason not to move D on turn 20?\n\nFor example, if I move L to (2,3), then I might go to (1,3), (1,2), etc., but no food there, and I delay eating (3,1), which might be riskier if something, but no.\n\nMoreover, the body might block paths.\n\nFor instance, if I go left, the snake body is on the right, so I might have more space, but in this case, moving D is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the head is adjacent to tail? No, head at (3,3), tail at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think moving D on turn 20 is best.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 20: D (down)\n\nThen turn 21: D (down) to eat\n\nThen turn 22: R (right) to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 23: R (right) to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 24: R (right) to (6,1) eat\n\nBut on turn 22, when I move R to (4,1), from (3,1), moving to (4,1) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 23, from (4,1), move R to (5,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 24, from (5,1), move R to (6,1), direction R.\n\nAll fine.\n\nAfter that, say turn 25, I can move U to (6,2) or something, but I don't need to output.\n\nFor the answer, since t1=20, I can output up to turn 24 or 25.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify, so perhaps 5 actions: turn 20 to 24.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions might be good.\n\nTurn 20,21,22,23,24.\n\nActions: D, D, R, R, R.\n\nBut let's confirm directions.\n\nOn turn 20, move D, head to (3,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 21, move D, to (3,1), eat, direction D.\n\nTurn 22, from (3,1), move R to (4,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 23, from (4,1), move R to (5,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 24, from (5,1), move R to (6,1), direction R.\n\nAll valid, no instant reverse.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nIf on turn 22 I moved L to (2,1), but then I might not go to (6,1) directly, but R is better to reach the other food.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 20 to 24). The key priorities are:\n- Eat the food at (3,1) quickly as it expires after turn 25 (life span 6, available turns 20-25).\n- Eat the food at (6,1) afterward, as it expires after turn 28 (life span 9, available turns 20-28) and is reachable.\n- Avoid the food at (2,6) as it is unreachable this turn (life span 1, only available on turn 20) and will disappear.\n- Ensure movements are safe (no collisions with walls, obstacles, or body segments, and no instant reversals).\n- Prioritize long-term survival by keeping the snake mobile and avoiding dead ends after eating food.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 20)\n- **Snake head**: (3,3), direction D (down).\n- **Possible moves from (3,3)**:\n  - **D (down) to (3,2)**: Safe, as (3,2) is unoccupied and within bounds.\n  - **L (left) to (2,3)**: Safe, as (2,3) is unoccupied and within bounds.\n  - **R (right) to (4,3)**: Deadly, as (4,3) is occupied by a body segment (not the tail).\n  - **U (up) to (3,4)**: Invalid due to instant reverse (current direction is D) and also occupied by body.\n- **Food status**:\n  - (2,6): Unreachable this turn and disappears after turn 20.\n  - (3,1): High priority to eat soon (expires after turn 25).\n  - (6,1): Can be eaten later (expires after turn 28).\n\n### Plan for Turns 20-24\n- **Turn 20: Move D (down)** to (3,2). This sets up a direct path to (3,1) for eating on turn 21. Moving L (left) would delay eating (3,1) and is less efficient.\n- **Turn 21: Move D (down)** to (3,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). This is safe as (3,1) is unoccupied (food is under no body) and no tail reward danger (tail is at (4,1), no food there).\n- **Turn 22: Move R (right)** to (4,1). This moves toward (6,1) and is safe because (4,1) is the tail cell (tail moves away after head movement).\n- **Turn 23: Move R (right)** to (5,1). Safe and unoccupied, continuing toward (6,1).\n- **Turn 24: Move R (right)** to (6,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). Safe and unoccupied.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats both foods quickly—(3,1) on turn 21 and (6,1) on turn 24—maximizing score early.\n- **Safety**: No collisions or instant reversals:\n  - Turn 20: Move D (from D direction, no reverse).\n  - Turn 21: Move D (from D direction, no reverse; (3,1) free).\n  - Turn 22: Move R (from D direction at (3,1), no reverse; (4,1) is tail).\n  - Turn 23: Move R (from R direction, no reverse; (5,1) free).\n  - Turn 24: Move R (from R direction, no reverse; (6,1) free).\n- **Long-term**: After turn 24, the snake is at (6,1) with length 9 (from initial 7 + 2 growths). The grid has 35 free cells (6x6 minus 1 obstacle), allowing safe navigation. Future moves can focus on survival (e.g., moving up to open areas).\n\n### Risks Avoided\n- (2,6) is ignored as unreachable.\n- No tail reward danger: When eating (3,1) on turn 21, the tail (at (4,1)) has no food, and head-tail are adjacent but not an issue. Similarly for (6,1).\n- Obstacle at (3,6) is avoided as not in the path.\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 24 and positions the snake for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 21: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 22: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 23: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 24: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 21, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 is playable? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on all four sides. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the tail is at (4,1).\n\nHead direction is Down, which is (x,y-1). Since head is at (3,2), moving down would go to (3,1).\n\nFood: one at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 6. Another at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn. So for food at (3,1), life span 6 at turn 21, so it will disappear after turn 26? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn. So at turn t, life span S, it will be gone by turn t + S - 1? No.\n\nThe description says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it exists for L more turns, including the current one.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nStandard interpretation: if countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n\n- At turn t, life span = L, meaning it has L turns left including current.\n\n- After turn t, at turn t+1, life span = L-1.\n\n- When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so after turn t+L-1, at turn t+L, it's gone.\n\nFor food at (3,1): at turn 21, life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 26 (since 21 to 26 is 6 turns: 21,22,23,24,25,26). After turn 26, it disappears at turn 27.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 21 to 28, disappears at turn 29.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,2), direction Down. So possible moves: since direction is Down, I can't move Up instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: Down, Left, Right. But I have to check for walls and collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (3,2): head\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1): tail\n\nThe snake has 7 segments. Positions are given in order: index 0 is head, so (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So it's like the snake was going up on x=3 from y=2 to y=4, then right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). Head is at (3,2) moving Down.\n\nCurrent direction is Down, so from (3,2), moving Down would go to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food! Positive food with value 1.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and collides with head.\n\nFirst, what is the tail position? Tail is at (4,1).\n\nIs (4,1) adjacent to head? Head is at (3,2), tail at (4,1). Distance: |3-4| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo adjacent cells to head (3,2) are:\n\n- Up: (3,3) - but that's body, occupied\n\n- Down: (3,1) - has food\n\n- Left: (2,2)\n\n- Right: (4,2) - which is body, occupied\n\nTail is at (4,1), which is not directly adjacent to head; (4,1) is down-right from (3,2), but not sharing a side. Adjacent cells are only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo (3,2) adjacent: (3,3) up, (3,1) down, (2,2) left, (4,2) right.\n\n(4,2) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is not adjacent to head; it's one cell away diagonally.\n\nSo no immediate Tail Reward Danger here.\n\nNow, moving to (3,1) would eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail is not removed; the segment is added, so length increases by 1.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,1) eats the food, value +1, length becomes 8.\n\nBut is it safe? (3,1) is not occupied by body, only by the food, but food is not obstacle; we can move to food cell.\n\nNow, check for walls: (3,1) is within bounds, x=3 between 1-6, y=1, which is not wall; walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), not relevant here.\n\nSo moving Down to (3,1) seems possible and eats food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Also, there's another food at (6,1).\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (3,2) with direction Down.\n\nCannot move Up, because that would be opposite direction instantly.\n\nPossible moves: Down, Left, Right.\n\n- Down: to (3,1) - has food, can eat, but need to check if safe.\n\n- Left: to (2,2) - empty? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nOccupied cells: snake positions and walls.\n\nWalls: all border x=0,7 y=0,7, and (3,6).\n\nSnake: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo (2,2) is not occupied, and not wall, so should be free.\n\n- Right: to (4,2) - but (4,2) is a body segment! Snake has (4,2) in positions, index 5: (4,2) is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,1) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is occupied by the snake body. Moving right to (4,2) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail in a way that moving in is safe.\n\nImportant rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (4,2) is not the tail; tail is (4,1). So (4,2) is a body segment, so moving to (4,2) would collide with body and die.\n\nTherefore, moving Right is not possible; it's deadly.\n\nMoving Left to (2,2) should be safe, as it's empty.\n\nMoving Down to (3,1) has food, but let's confirm if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, after moving to (3,1), if I eat, the snake grows. The head moves to (3,1), and since it eats, the tail doesn't move, so the new positions would be: head at (3,1), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, and so on, down to tail (4,1) still there, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake eats, it grows by one segment. So when head moves to a food cell, the tail doesn't advance; the snake adds a new segment at the tail end.\n\nSo positions: after moving down to (3,1) and eating:\n\n- New head: (3,1)\n\n- Then the previous segments: (3,2) becomes body, (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) all stay, and since we ate, we add a new tail segment, but where? The tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the current tail position? No.\n\nTypically, when snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nBut when it eats, the tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nNormally, without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves away from its old position.\n\nWith eating: head moves to food, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the segment before it now connects to it.\n\nIn terms of positions list: suppose current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., ] so T is removed.\n\nWith eating: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] , so T stays, and new_H is added.\n\nBut since we add a new segment at the tail, the positions become [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T], with T being the new tail? No.\n\nFor example, current: [H, B1, B2, T]\n\nAfter moving and eating: head moves to new cell, say new_H, then the body segments: B1 moves to H's old position, B2 moves to B1's old position, but T doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added where? The new segment is added at the tail, so T remains, and we add a new segment at T's position? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nStandard way: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail position doesn't change in this move; it remains, and the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn the positions list, after move with eat: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, old_B2, ..., old_tail] and since we add a segment, the old_tail is now part of body, and the new tail is still old_tail? No.\n\nLet's index: positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nAfter moving without eating: new positions: Q0 = new position, Q1 = P0, Q2 = P1, ..., Qk = P_{k-1}, so Pk (tail) is removed.\n\nWith eating: new positions: Q0 = new position, Q1 = P0, Q2 = P1, ..., Qk = P_{k-1}, Q_{k+1} = Pk, so the tail Pk stays as the new last segment, and a new segment is added at the end, which is the old tail position.\n\nIn this case, the cell that was tail is now occupied by the new tail segment, so it doesn't become empty.\n\nIn terms of collision: after move, the head is at new position, and all previous positions are still occupied except the old tail is now part of body if not eaten, but with eating, the old tail position is still occupied.\n\nIn this specific case: current positions: let's list indices.\n\nP0: (3,2) head\n\nP1: (3,3)\n\nP2: (3,4)\n\nP3: (4,4)\n\nP4: (4,3)\n\nP5: (4,2)\n\nP6: (4,1) tail\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) and eat the food there.\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nThen new positions: Q0 = (3,1)\n\nQ1 = P0 = (3,2)  // old head\n\nQ2 = P1 = (3,3)\n\nQ3 = P2 = (3,4)\n\nQ4 = P3 = (4,4)\n\nQ5 = P4 = (4,3)\n\nQ6 = P5 = (4,2)  // this was P5, now Q6\n\nQ7 = P6 = (4,1)  // new tail\n\nSo the snake grows to 8 segments. Positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n\nNow, is there any collision? Head at (3,1), body at (3,2), (3,3), etc., all fine, no self-collision.\n\n(3,1) was food, not body, so no issue.\n\nTail is at (4,1), head at (3,1), which are adjacent now? (3,1) and (4,1) are both at y=1, x=3 and x=4, so they share a side? (3,1) and (4,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut head is at (3,1), tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent cells.\n\nBut is this a problem? Only if we have Tail Reward Danger, but that's when we eat food that is under the tail and head moves to tail cell, but here we ate food at (3,1), not at tail.\n\nTail Reward Danger is specific: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nIn this case, after eating, head is at (3,1), tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent, but the tail cell is (4,1), which does not have food; the food was at (3,1), which we just ate.\n\nSo no food at tail cell, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nMoreover, even if they are adjacent, it's not necessarily dangerous; only if the tail cell has food and we eat it, but we didn't.\n\nSo moving down to (3,1) seems safe and gives +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere's another food at (6,1), which is also at y=1, so on the same row.\n\ny=1 is the bottom row, since y=0 is wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so y=1 is the lowest playable row.\n\nNow, after moving down to (3,1), the snake is at (3,1), with direction now Down? Or do I need to set the new direction.\n\nThe head direction after move will be the direction I moved, so Down.\n\nNow, from there, I need to plan future moves.\n\nBut first, let's see all options for current turn.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- Down: to (3,1), eat food, safe, as above.\n\n- Left: to (2,2), empty, no food.\n\n- Right: to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body (P5), so collision, not possible.\n\nSo only Down and Left are possible moves? Down to (3,1) or Left to (2,2).\n\nRight is invalid due to body collision.\n\nSo choices: Down (eat food) or Left (no food).\n\nIf I go Down, I get immediate reward, but what about the future?\n\nIf I go Left, I avoid eating for now, but why would I? The food at (3,1) has life span 6, so it will be there for a few more turns, I could eat it later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nLet's think about the grid state.\n\nFirst, with the snake occupying many cells around (3,1) to (4,4).\n\nAfter eating at (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo the area around (3,1) is almost surrounded by body.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves next turn:\n\nHead at (3,1), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves: Down? (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down to (3,0), it's out of bounds or wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so moving down from (3,1) to (3,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nCannot move down.\n\nCannot move up because current direction is Down, so moving up would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,1) with dir Down: Left or Right, since Down is wall, Up is reverse.\n\nSo only Left to (2,1) or Right to (4,1).\n\nNow, (4,1) is the current tail position. After we moved to (3,1) and ate, tail is at (4,1), as per above.\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), that is the tail cell.\n\nMoving to tail cell: since the tail will move, it might be safe.\n\nBut in this case, after we eat, the tail didn't move; it stayed because we added a segment.\n\nIn the new state, if I move right to (4,1), which is occupied by the tail.\n\nNow, according to rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, when I move to the tail cell, and if the tail moves, it becomes free.\n\nBut here, after eating, the tail didn't move; it stayed.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent after eat: positions at turn 22? Turn 21 move to (3,1) eat.\n\nAt turn 21, after action, new state for turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, snake positions: as above, [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] with head at (3,1), and the snake just ate, so for the next move, when we move, if we don't eat, the tail will move.\n\nBut at this point, for moving from (3,1) to (4,1), (4,1) is occupied by the tail segment.\n\nIf we move to (4,1), since it's the tail, and after we move, the tail will move away if no eat, so it should be safe.\n\nSpecifically: at turn 22, head at (3,1), positions: P0=(3,1), P1=(3,2), P2=(3,3), P3=(3,4), P4=(4,4), P5=(4,3), P6=(4,2), P7=(4,1) tail\n\nIf we move right to (4,1), which is P7, the tail.\n\nSince we move to tail, and if there is no food, we don't eat, so the snake moves: new head at (4,1), then each segment moves: P0 moves to (4,1), P1 moves to P0's old position (3,1)? Let's see.\n\nAfter move without eating: new head position is (4,1), then new body: the previous head (3,1) becomes segment 1, previous P1 (3,2) becomes segment 2, ..., up to previous P6 (4,2) becomes segment 7, and the tail P7 (4,1) is left, but since we move to it, and no eat, the tail position is vacated.\n\nNew positions: Q0 = (4,1) // new head\n\nQ1 = P0 = (3,1)  // previous head\n\nQ2 = P1 = (3,2)\n\nQ3 = P2 = (3,3)\n\nQ4 = P3 = (3,4)\n\nQ5 = P4 = (4,4)\n\nQ6 = P5 = (4,3)\n\nQ7 = P6 = (4,2)  // new tail, since P7 is not included\n\nP6 was (4,2), which becomes the new tail.\n\nThe cell (4,1) was tail, but we moved head there, and since no food, tail moves to (4,2), so (4,1) is now head, (4,2) is tail, etc.\n\nNo collision because the tail moved.\n\nSimilarly, if we move left to (2,1), which should be free.\n\n(2,1) is within bounds, not occupied? Currently, snake occupies from (3,1) to (4,4), etc., but (2,1) should be free.\n\nWalls: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (3,6), so (2,1) is playable and empty.\n\nNow, back to current turn.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) on turn 21, I eat the food, get +1, and then on turn 22, I can go left to (2,1) or right to (4,1), both possible.\n\nBut if I go left to (2,2) now on turn 21, I don't eat, and the snake moves to (2,2), then positions: head (2,2), then (3,2) old head, (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail.\n\nSince no eat, tail (4,1) is removed, so positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] with tail at (4,2).\n\nLength 7 still.\n\nThen from there, I could later go to (3,1) to eat food, but (3,1) has food, and it's adjacent to (2,2) or (3,2), but head at (2,2), so I can move down to (2,1) or left to (1,2) or right to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so not possible, or up to (2,3).\n\nBut food at (3,1) is still there.\n\nHowever, if I don't eat now, the food at (3,1) might be available later, but I need to consider the other food and the board state.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with the tail if I delay eating.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term plan.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eating both foods is good, but I have to survive.\n\nFirst, food at (3,1) life span 6, from turn 21, so it disappears at turn 27 (after turn 26).\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) life span 8, disappears at turn 29.\n\nNow, current turn 21.\n\nIf I eat (3,1) now, I get +1, and snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but I can go for the other food.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can go towards (6,1) or something.\n\nBut (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is far, and there is an obstacle at (3,6), so I need to navigate.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently in the bottom-left area.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 6x6 playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (3,6) is blocked, so not all cells.\n\nPlayable cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 except (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — so it forms a sort of loop or U-shape.\n\nFrom (4,1) up to (4,4), then left to (3,4), down to (3,2).\n\nHead at (3,2) moving down.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), eat, then as above.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is tail, but moving there is safe as we saw.\n\nBut if I go right to (4,1), then from there, head at (4,1), direction right? If I moved right, new direction right.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: up to (4,2), but (4,2) is body? After moving to (4,1), positions as above with head at (4,1), body at (3,1), (3,2), etc., and tail at (4,2) or something.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should consider paths to both foods.\n\nBut (3,1) is very close, and if I don't eat it now, I might not get another chance or it might be risky.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (2,2) now, then from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) or left to (1,2) or up to (2,3).\n\n(2,1) is empty, no food.\n\nThen from (2,1), I could move right to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I move to (3,1), the head is at (3,1), and what is the body?\n\nIf at turn 21 I move left to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail (4,1)? No, after move no eat: head to (2,2), then body: (3,2) from old head, (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) is removed, so positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] with tail at (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 22, from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1), for example.\n\nThen positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail at (4,2)? After move, new head (2,1), new body (2,2) old head, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail (4,2) removed? Old tail was (4,2), so new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move right to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nMove to (3,1), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), body (2,1) old head, (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and add new segment at tail, so tail at (4,3) stays, new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n\nNow, head at (3,1), body at (2,1) and others.\n\nIs there collision? No, all good.\n\nBut in this case, I ate the food at turn 23 or something, later.\n\nBut I got the same +1, but later, and I used two moves to get there, whereas if I ate immediately on turn 21, I get it now.\n\nMoreover, the food life span is long, so no urgency, but why delay for no reason?\n\nBut by delaying, I might have more options, but in this case, eating immediately seems fine.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue with the tail position.\n\nAfter eating at (3,1) immediately, the snake is at (3,1) with body around, and I have to move left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), then from there I can go up or left, etc.\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), then head at (4,1), with body at (3,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is where the tail was, but after moving, it's head.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go up to (4,2) or right to (5,1) or down to (4,0) but wall, so not.\n\ny=0 wall, so from (4,1), moving down not possible.\n\nPossible moves: up, left, right.\n\nBut current direction after moving right to (4,1) is Right.\n\nSo cannot move left instantly (opposite).\n\nSo from (4,1) dir Right, possible: up, right, down (but down wall, so up or right).\n\nUp to (4,2), but (4,2) is body? In the positions after moving to (4,1) with eat, we had body at (4,2), which is part of snake.\n\nSo moving up to (4,2) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, right to (5,1), which might be free.\n\nLet's clarify the state.\n\nIf at turn 21 I move down to (3,1) and eat, positions for turn 22: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail.\n\nThen if I move right to (4,1), which is tail, and no food there? (4,1) has no food, so I move to it, and since it's tail, it should be safe.\n\nAfter move: new head (4,1), new body (3,1) old head, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail is (4,2) now? Old tail (4,1) is where head moved, so new positions: Q0 = (4,1), Q1 = (3,1), Q2 = (3,2), Q3 = (3,3), Q4 = (3,4), Q5 = (4,4), Q6 = (4,3), Q7 = (4,2) tail.\n\nSo tail at (4,2).\n\nHead at (4,1), direction Right (since I moved right).\n\nNow from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,2) - but (4,2) is now tail position, occupied by tail.\n\nMoving to tail cell: since it's tail, and I move there, if no food, tail moves away.\n\nSo I can move to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, right to (5,1) - free, probably.\n\nDown: to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nLeft: to (3,1) - but (3,1) is occupied by body, Q1 (3,1), so collision, cannot move left.\n\nAlso, cannot move left because current direction is Right, moving left would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only up or right.\n\nIf I move up to (4,2), which is tail, no food, so safe: new head (4,2), body (4,1), (3,1), etc., tail moves to (4,3) or something.\n\nIf I move right to (5,1), free.\n\nBut moving up to (4,2) might not be useful, as it's body.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1) if I move left to (2,1), then head at (2,1), direction Left, then I can go left to (1,1), down to (2,0) wall, or up to (2,2), but (2,2) might be body or not.\n\nAfter moving left to (2,1) from (3,1), positions: new head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail at (4,1)? From earlier state.\n\nAfter move from (3,1) to (2,1) no eat: new head (2,1), new body (3,1) old head, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) removed, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3)? Q0=(2,1), Q1=(3,1), Q2=(3,2), Q3=(3,3), Q4=(3,4), Q5=(4,4), Q6=(4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) tail.\n\nThen from (2,1), direction Left, possible moves: left to (1,1), up to (2,2), down wall, right to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, occupied, so collision, cannot.\n\nSo only left or up.\n\n(2,2) is free, I assume.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nTo think long-term, I should consider going for the other food at (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is the bottom-right corner, since x=7 wall.\n\ny=1, x=6.\n\nFrom current position (3,2), if I want to go to (6,1), I need to move right and down, but I'm at y=2, so down to y=1 then right.\n\nBut directly down to (3,1) has food, but if I eat it, I'm stuck at (3,1) with limited moves, as above.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can move left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1) to eat or to (4,1), etc., but that seems inefficient for reaching (6,1).\n\nFrom (3,2), instead of down or left, I have no other choice, right is invalid.\n\nSo only down or left.\n\nIf I go left to (2,2), then I can go down to (2,1), then right to (3,1) to eat or to (4,1), but to go to (6,1), I need to go right from there.\n\nAfter eating at (3,1) later, I'm at (3,1) or nearby.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the area.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (3,1) now to keep the snake shorter for maneuverability to reach (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 8, so I have time.\n\nLife span 8 from turn 21, so by turn 28 it's gone.\n\nCurrent turn 21.\n\nDistance to (6,1): from (3,2) to (6,1) is |6-3| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 cells away, so 4 moves minimum.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nBut with the body, it might take more turns.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might block paths.\n\ny=6 is the top row, y=6, x=3 is blocked, so to go from bottom to top, I need to avoid (3,6).\n\nBut for now, I'm at bottom.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,1) is under the snake's body? No, it's at (3,1), which is not occupied; only when head moves there it can be eaten.\n\nBut in the rules, food can spawn under body, but in this case, (3,1) is not under body; it's free.\n\nAt turn 21, (3,1) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, snake is at (3,2) etc., so (3,1) is free with food.\n\nSo I can eat it directly.\n\nBut let's think about Tail Reward Danger for the future.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (3,1) now, then move to (2,1) or (4,1), and later the tail might have food, but no food on tail now.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, I need to output actions for turn 21, 22, 23, etc., up to 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but I need to decide the first action with long-term in mind.\n\nLet's consider the two choices for turn 21.\n\nChoice 1: Move Down to (3,1), eat food. Score +1.\n\nThen for turn 22, from (3,1), I can move Left to (2,1) or Right to (4,1).\n\nIf I move Left to (2,1), then head at (2,1), dir Left.\n\nThen I can move Left to (1,1) or Up to (2,2), since down wall, right to (3,1) body, not possible.\n\n(1,1) is free, probably.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left, but left to (0,1) wall, so only up or right, but right to (2,1) not, etc.\n\nTo reach (6,1), I need to go right, so from (2,1), moving up to (2,2) might be better.\n\nSimilarly, if from (3,1) I move right to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nAnother food at (6,1), so from current position, if I don't eat (3,1) now, I can move left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1) to eat or skip to (4,1), but (4,1) might be occupied later.\n\nAt turn 21, if I move left to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail at (4,1) removed? After move no eat, tail (4,1) removed, so positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] tail at (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is still there with food.\n\nThen at turn 22, from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1), for example.\n\nThen positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail at (4,2)? New positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\n(4,2) is now free, but no food.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move right to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nMove to (3,1), eat, new positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and add new segment, so tail at (4,3) stays, new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\nHead at (3,1), direction Right (since moved right from (2,1)? From (2,1) to (3,1), moved right, so dir Right.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: up to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, occupied, so collision.\n\nRight to (4,1), which is free now? At this point, (4,1) is free, since tail is at (4,3).\n\nPositions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,1) is free, (3,2) is occupied.\n\nSo from (3,1) dir Right, possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (3,2) - occupied by body, collision, die.\n\n- Down: to (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (2,1) - occupied by body, collision.\n\n- Right: to (4,1) - free, no food.\n\nSo only possible move is Right to (4,1), since up, down, left all invalid or collision.\n\nDown to (3,0) wall, left to (2,1) body, up to (3,2) body, only right to (4,1).\n\nSo I can move right to (4,1).\n\nThen from there, head at (4,1), dir Right, then I can go up to (4,2) or right to (5,1) or down wall, left to (3,1) body.\n\n(4,2) is free? In positions, (4,2) is not occupied, only up to (4,3) tail, so (4,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) free.\n\nSo I can move.\n\nBut the point is, if I delay eating (3,1), when I finally eat it at (3,1), I am forced to move right to (4,1), because other directions are blocked by body.\n\nWhereas if I eat it immediately on turn 21, from (3,1) I have choices to go left or right.\n\nFor example, if I eat on turn 21, move to (3,1), then on turn 22 I can move left to (2,1), which is free, then from (2,1) I can go left or up, and have more space.\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut in the delayed case, when I eat at (3,1) later, I am trapped and must move right, which might not be ideal.\n\nMoreover, in the delayed case, I used extra moves to eat the same food.\n\nSo it's better to eat immediately on turn 21.\n\nThen for long-term, I can go for the other food.\n\nAlso, there might be a risk with the food under body, but here no.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,1) is on the same row, so I can head towards it.\n\nFor example, after eating at (3,1) on turn 21, on turn 22 I can move right to (4,1) or left to (2,1).\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), then from (4,1) I can move right to (5,1), then to (6,1) to eat.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 21: move Down to (3,1), eat.\n\nState turn 22: head at (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) tail. Dir Down? After moving down, dir is Down.\n\nBut from (3,1), as before, only left or right possible.\n\nSay I move right to (4,1).\n\nSince (4,1) is tail, no food, so move to it.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail. Dir Right.\n\nThen turn 23: from (4,1) dir Right, move right to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) should be free, no wall, not occupied.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail at (4,2)? After move no eat: new head (5,1), new body (4,1) old head, (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail (4,2) removed, so positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\nThen turn 24: from (5,1) dir Right (since moved right), move right to (6,1), which has food, eat.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and add new segment, so tail at (4,3) stays? New positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n\nAte both foods, score +2.\n\nAnd snake is longer, but at (6,1), which is corner, so need to be careful.\n\nFrom (6,1), direction Right, but x=7 wall, so cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves: up to (6,2), left to (5,1), down to (6,0) wall.\n\nCannot move down or right, only up or left.\n\nBut left to (5,1) is body, occupied, so collision if move left.\n\nUp to (6,2) might be free.\n\nIn positions, (6,2) is not occupied, so can move up.\n\nBut this is after eating, so I can survive.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate both foods in 4 turns: turn 21 eat (3,1), turn 22 move to (4,1), turn 23 to (5,1), turn 24 eat (6,1).\n\nAnd I have to think about life span: (3,1) life 6, eaten turn 21, fine. (6,1) life 8, eaten turn 24, fine.\n\nIf I had not eaten (3,1) immediately, I might not reach (6,1) as quickly.\n\nFor example, if I go left first, it takes more turns.\n\nSo the immediate eat seems efficient.\n\nMoreover, in the sequence above, after eating (6,1), I might be at risk, but I can move up to (6,2) and continue.\n\nBut since I need to output actions for multiple turns, I can plan this sequence.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but at least for the current and a few ahead.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut for now, for turn 21, I think moving Down to eat (3,1) is best.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any danger.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (4,1) on turn 22, it was tail, but safe.\n\nAnd to (5,1) free, then to (6,1) eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 25, head at (6,1), I need to move, say up to (6,2).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut since no more food, I need to survive, but that's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating (3,1) and go directly to (6,1), but from (3,2), moving down to (3,1) is towards it, but I eat on the way.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can move left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1) but I might eat or not, but if I don't eat, I can go to (4,1), but (4,1) might be free only if tail moved.\n\nAt turn 21, if I move left to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), tail gone, so (4,1) free but no food.\n\nThen from (2,2) to (2,1), then to (3,1), if I eat, I get stuck as before, or skip to (4,1).\n\nSay on turn 21: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 22: move D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 23: move R to (3,1) but if I eat, then from (3,1) I can only move R to (4,1) as before.\n\nIf I don't eat, move to (3,1) without eating? But (3,1) has food, so if head moves there, it must eat, I think. The rule is, when head moves to food cell, it eats automatically.\n\nSo I cannot skip; if I move to (3,1), I eat.\n\nSo on turn 23, if I move to (3,1), I eat, then same as before, stuck and must move right.\n\nThen turn 24: move R to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 25: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 26: move R to (6,1) eat.\n\nSo I eat (6,1) on turn 26, but (3,1) was eaten on turn 23, and (6,1) life span 8, eaten turn 26 fine, but I used more turns: 21:L, 22:D, 23:eat (3,1), 24:R to (4,1), 25:R to (5,1), 26:eat (6,1). So 6 turns to eat both, whereas with immediate eat: 21:eat (3,1), 22:R to (4,1), 23:R to (5,1), 24:eat (6,1), only 4 turns.\n\nAlso, in the delayed case, I might have risked the food disappearing, but life span ok.\n\nBut with immediate eat, I get the first food earlier and can reach the second faster.\n\nMoreover, in immediate eat, after eating (6,1), I have turns left to do other things, but no more food.\n\nSo better to eat immediately.\n\nTherefore, for turn 21, action: Down.\n\nThen for subsequent actions, to reach (6,1).\n\nAfter move down to (3,1) on turn 21, on turn 22, I need to move either left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), then I have to go to (1,1) or up, which might not help to reach (6,1).\n\nWhereas if I move right to (4,1), I can go directly to (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nSo better to move right on turn 22.\n\nThen turn 23 move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 24 move right to (6,1) and eat.\n\nNow, on turn 24, when I move to (6,1), it has food, so I eat.\n\nNow, after that, I need to continue, but no more food, so I just need to survive.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), after eating, head at (6,1), body includes (5,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nThen I can move up to (6,2), for instance.\n\nBut since the answer might not require too many turns, I can output up to turn 24 or 25.\n\nThe current turn is t1=21, so actions for turn 21, 22, 23, 24, 25? But not specified.\n\nSince I think 5 turns ahead, I can do up to turn 26.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, action for turn 21: Down\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,1), move Right to (4,1)\n\nIn terms of direction: after moving down to (3,1), dir is Down. Then moving right to (4,1), which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen after moving right, dir is Right.\n\nTurn 23: move Right to (5,1)\n\nDir Right, moving right to (5,1).\n\nTurn 24: move Right to (6,1), eat.\n\nNow, after that, turn 25: head at (6,1), dir Right.\n\nPossible moves: up to (6,2), left to (5,1), down to (6,0) wall, right to (7,1) wall.\n\nCannot move down or right.\n\nLeft to (5,1) is body, occupied, so collision if move left.\n\nUp to (6,2) should be free.\n\nSo must move up to (6,2).\n\nThen dir Up.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output actions for turn 21 to 25 or so.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and I need to box it.\n\nNow, one thing: in turn 22, when I move to (4,1), it was tail, but as per rules, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nIf on turn 22 I move left to (2,1), it might take longer.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 21: D (down)\n\nTurn 22: R (right) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 23: R (right) to (5,1)\n\nTurn 24: R (right) to (6,1) and eat\n\nThen turn 25: need to move, say U (up) to (6,2)\n\nBut since no food, I can stop at turn 24, but to show survival, perhaps include.\n\nThe problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, so for turn 21, plan up to 26 or so.\n\nBut after turn 24, I can continue.\n\nBut for now, let's output up to turn 25.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 25, from (6,1) after eating, I move up to (6,2).\n\nBut after eating at (6,1) on turn 24, positions: similar to before, head at (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), etc., and since ate, tail grows.\n\nThen on turn 25, move up to (6,2).\n\nThen dir Up, and so on.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 21: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn 22: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn 23: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn 24: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn 25: U} }\n\nBut turn 25 U is from (6,1) to (6,2), which is fine.\n\nI could add more, but not necessary.\n\nIn this, I ate both foods by turn 24.\n\nAnd for long-term, I can survive by moving up.\n\nBut is there any risk I missed?\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), but I'm at bottom, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food life span: (3,1) eaten turn 21, life span 6, ok. (6,1) eaten turn 24, life span 8, turn 21+8-1=28? Life span 8 at turn 21, so can be eaten until turn 28 (since 21 to 28 is 8 turns? Turns: 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28: 8 turns, disappears at turn 29. Eaten turn 24 < 28, fine.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the actions are as above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan its moves at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 21) has positive food at (3,1) and (6,1), both with value +1. The food at (3,1) has a life span of 6 (disappears after turn 26), and the food at (6,1) has a life span of 8 (disappears after turn 28). The snake head is at (3,2) with direction Down, and moving Down to (3,1) allows immediate consumption of the food for +1 score without immediate risk, as the head is not adjacent to the tail and no collision occurs.\n\nHowever, eating at (3,1) now could limit maneuverability due to the snake's increased length and the surrounding body segments. After analysis, moving Down to eat (3,1) is optimal for these reasons:\n- **Immediate reward**: Eating (3,1) on turn 21 secures +1 score before the food expires, and the life span allows flexibility.\n- **Path to second food**: From (3,1), moving right to (4,1) (tail position) is safe (tail moves away), enabling a direct path to (6,1) via (5,1). This avoids the internal obstacle at (3,6) and minimizes turns.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Moving left to (2,2) on turn 21 delays eating (3,1) but risks the snake becoming trapped after eating later (e.g., only right moves possible from (3,1)), reducing options for reaching (6,1). Eating immediately provides more control.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), the sequence focuses on reaching (6,1) efficiently:\n- **Turn 22**: From (3,1), move Right to (4,1). This is safe as (4,1) is the tail; the tail moves, and no food is on the tail cell.\n- **Turn 23**: From (4,1), move Right to (5,1). This cell is free, and the move is safe.\n- **Turn 24**: From (5,1), move Right to (6,1) and eat the food for another +1 score. This occurs within the food's life span (turn 24 < 28).\n\nPost-turn 24, the snake must avoid collisions. From (6,1), moving Up to (6,2) on turn 25 is the only safe option (left to (5,1) causes body collision; down and right are walls). This ensures survival and opens paths for further movement.\n\n**5+ turn plan justification**:\n- **Score maximization**: Both foods are eaten by turn 24 for +2 total score. No negative food is present.\n- **Survival priority**: The sequence avoids walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. After turn 25, the snake can navigate upward (e.g., to (6,3)) for safety, leveraging the grid's open areas.\n- **Long-term view**: If (6,1) were not eaten by turn 24 (e.g., due to delays), it could still be eaten by turn 28, but the direct path minimizes risk and turn count. Alternative paths (e.g., moving left first) take more turns and increase collision risk near the body.\n\n**Final Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 21: Down (eat food at (3,1), score +1, length 8).\n- Turn 22: Right (to (4,1), safe tail move).\n- Turn 23: Right (to (5,1), free cell).\n- Turn 24: Right (to (6,1), eat food, score +1, length 9).\n- Turn 25: Up (to (6,2), avoid corner trap).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 21: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 22: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 23: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 24: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 25: U}\n}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1).

Head direction is D, so last move was down, but now at (3,1), which is above the wall at y=0.\n\ny=0 is the bottom wall? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically, in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. The walls are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so it's a bounded grid. I think we can assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But for movement, it doesn't matter as long as we're consistent.\n\nIn the snake positions, head is at (3,1), and direction down, so moving down decreases y? Or increases y? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down? That might be counterintuitive.\n\nU: (x, y+1) — so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north or up.\n\nD: (x, y-1) — y-1 is down, so lower y is south or down.\n\nL: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x\n\nR: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x\n\nWalls: border cells, so x=0 (left wall), x=7 (right wall), y=0 (bottom wall? If y decreases down, then y=0 might be bottom), y=7 (top wall).\n\nConfirming with snake positions: head at (3,1), which is above y=0, so if y=0 is bottom, then (3,1) is one row above bottom.\n\nDirection D (down) means towards lower y, so towards y=0.\n\nBut at (3,1), moving down to (3,0) would hit the wall at y=0, which is deadly. So I cannot move down now.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning the snake was moving down to get to (3,1), so previous position was (3,2)? No, positions: head is (3,1), then (3,2), so from (3,2) to (3,1), which is moving down? (3,2) to (3,1): y from 2 to 1, decrease, so down. Yes.\n\nNow, current head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nAvailable moves: since direction is D, I cannot instantly reverse to U, because that would be opposite direction. So possible moves are L, R, or D, but D is into wall, so not possible.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction, so cannot move U (up), since current direction is D.\n\nPossible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But D is to (3,0), which is wall, so invalid. L is to (2,1), R is to (4,1).\n\nNow, check if (2,1) and (4,1) are safe.\n\nFirst, walls: border walls, x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(2,1): x=2, y=1, not on border walls, and not (3,6), so no wall.\n\n(4,1): similarly, x=4, y=1, not wall.\n\nNow, snake body: positions are [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n\n(4,1) is the tail, but it's a body segment. When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so moving to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail is safe, because the tail will move, and the snake grows only if it eats food.\n\nGeneral rule: collision happens if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves. But if you move to the tail cell, and it's not growing, it's ok, since tail leaves.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,1), which is currently the tail, but when I move there, the tail will move to the next position, so it should be safe, as long as I don't eat food or something.\n\nSpecifically, collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and the snake doesn't grow, it's ok.\n\nBut here, positions: (4,1) is the tail. If I move right to (4,1), head goes to (4,1), which was tail, but tail will move to where? After move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment shifts, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food is eaten yet in this move, tail is removed, so (4,1) becomes the new head or something. Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,1) tail.\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), which is currently occupied by tail.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,1), then body segments follow: segment 1 (was (3,2)) moves to previous head position? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at position 0 moves to the new head position, then position 1 moves to where position 0 was, position 2 to where 1 was, and so on, up to the tail. Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake length stays the same.\n\nPositions list: after moving head to (4,1), which was tail, now head is at (4,1), but (4,1) was the last position. Then the new positions: head at (4,1), then segment that was at index 0 is now at new position, but index 0 was (3,1), which is now where the head was? I think I need to think of the list shifting.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1):\n\n- New head: (4,1)\n\n- Then the body segments: the first body segment was (3,2), which now moves to the old head position (3,1)? No.\n\nIn terms of the list: the head moves to the new cell, so new position 0 is (4,1)\n\nThen position 1 is the old position 0, which is (3,1)\n\nPosition 2 is old position 1, (3,2)\n\nPosition 3 is old position 2, (3,3)\n\nPosition 4 is old position 3, (3,4)\n\nPosition 5 is old position 4, (4,4)\n\nPosition 6 is old position 5, (4,3)\n\nPosition 7 is old position 6, (4,2)\n\nBut since no food eaten, we remove the last segment, so the tail is removed. The tail was old position 7, (4,1), but it's not there anymore.\n\nNew positions: from above, after head moves to (4,1), the list becomes: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nOld position 7 (tail) is gone, so positions are new head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and (4,2) is the last? Let's count:\n\nNew head: (4,1) - from move\n\nThen the previous segments: the segment that was at index 0 ( (3,1) ) becomes the new index 1, at (3,1)\n\nIndex 1 was (3,2), becomes index 2 at (3,2)\n\nIndex 2 was (3,3), index 3 at (3,3)\n\nIndex 3 was (3,4), index 4 at (3,4)\n\nIndex 4 was (4,4), index 5 at (4,4)\n\nIndex 5 was (4,3), index 6 at (4,3)\n\nIndex 6 was (4,2), index 7 at (4,2)\n\nAnd index 7 was tail, removed. So new snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (4,1), tail at (4,2)? (4,2) is the last.\n\nNow, the cell (4,1) was occupied by the tail, but after move, it's head, and no collision because the tail moved away.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,1) is safe because it was the tail, and tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,1), which is empty, so also safe.\n\nBut (2,1) is not occupied by body, so definitely safe.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\nFood: (6,1,7,1) — this should be (x,y, life_span, value), but in input it says \" (6, 1, 7, 1) \" and \" (5, 4, 10, 1) \".\n\nIn the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 1, 7, 1) - (5, 4, 10, 1)\"\n\nSo (6,1) with life_span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n(5,4) with life_span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food.\n\nLife span: for (6,1), life_span 7 at turn 22, so it disappears after N turns, meaning after 7 turns from now, or in 7 turns?\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present on turns t to t+L-1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., down to 0, and at turn when countdown 0, it disappears, so it is present for L turns starting from turn t.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it means: if at turn t, food has life_span N, then at turn t, countdown is N, turn t+1 countdown N-1, ..., turn t+N-1 countdown 1, and at turn t+N, it disappears, so it is available from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n\nSimilarly for (5,4), life_span 10 at turn 22, so available from turn 22 to 31.\n\n(6,1) life_span 7, available turn 22 to 28.\n\nNow, special cases: food can spawn under snake body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, both food are not under snake, I think.\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), snake positions: all are (3,y) or (4,y) for y=1 to 4, so (6,1) is free.\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), snake has (3,4) and (4,4), but not (5,4), so free.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food on tail currently.\n\nTail is at (4,1), no food there.\n\nNow, current turn 22, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nCannot move down to (3,0) because wall.\n\nCannot move up because opposite direction (current D, U is opposite).\n\nCan move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is currently tail, but as above, it should be safe to move there.\n\nBut let's see the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake: from (3,1) down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then down to (4,3)? Positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo it's like a shape: from (3,1) to (3,4) up, then to (4,4) right, then down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — so it's like a \"C\" or something.\n\nHead at (3,1), moving D is invalid, so options: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is empty, (4,1) is tail.\n\nIf I move to (4,1), as above, new head at (4,1), and tail was at (4,1), but it moves, so no collision.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (6,1) and (5,4).\n\n(6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is near bottom right.\n\n(5,4) at x=5,y=4.\n\nNow, life span: (6,1) has shorter life, only 7 turns, so must be eaten by turn 28.\n\n(5,4) has 10 turns, by turn 31.\n\nBut turn 22, so (6,1) expires sooner.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score, so eat positive food, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, possible actions at turn 22: L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), then head to (2,1), direction now L (since I moved left).\n\nThen positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) — tail at (4,2) or (4,1)? After move to (2,1), no food, so snake: new head (2,1), then old head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (4,1) removed? Positions: new positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2).\n\nDirection: since moved L, head direction is now L.\n\nIf I move R to (4,1), head to (4,1), direction R, positions as before: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to L since direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCurrent direction after move would be the direction I just moved.\n\nAt turn 22, after move, new direction set to the move direction.\n\nFor turn 22 action, if I move L, then direction becomes L; if R, direction becomes R.\n\nNow, food: (6,1) is at (6,1), which is east of (4,1) or (2,1).\n\n(5,4) at (5,4).\n\nTo reach (6,1) from current head (3,1), I need to go right.\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I go away from (6,1), which has short life, so might miss it.\n\n(6,1) life_span 7, from turn 22 to 28, so 7 turns including turn 22? Countdown at turn 22 is 7, decreases each turn, so available on turns where countdown >=1, so turn 22 (cd=7), 23(6), ..., 28(1), gone on turn 29. So must eat by turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) cd=10 at turn 22, so available turn 22 to 31, gone on turn 32.\n\nNow, from (3,1) to (6,1): delta x=3, delta y=0, so 3 steps right, but snake body might be in way.\n\nPath to (6,1): if I move right to (4,1) at turn 22, then from (4,1) to (6,1) is two steps right: (5,1) then (6,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is empty? Let's see.\n\nGrid: walls only at borders and (3,6), so (5,1) should be free.\n\nBut after moving to (4,1), positions: head at (4,1), body at (3,1), (3,2), etc., so (5,1) is free.\n\nThen I can move to (5,1) at turn 23, then (6,1) at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 24, I can eat (6,1) if I move to it.\n\nLife_span: at turn 22, cd=7, turn 23 cd=6, turn 24 cd=5, so yes, available.\n\nThen eating (6,1) gives +1, snake grows.\n\nBut after eating, length increases.\n\nNow, what about the tail? (6,1) is not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n\nNow, if I move left to (2,1) at turn 22, then I am at (2,1), and (6,1) is at distance: from (2,1) to (6,1) is 4 steps right, but I need to go through (3,1), which might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 22 after moving left to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,1) is now a body segment, not head.\n\nTo go to (6,1), I need to move right to (3,1) at some point, but (3,1) is occupied by body.\n\nFor example, at turn 23, from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1), but (3,1) is currently occupied by body segment.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), which is a body cell, it might cause collision, unless it's the tail.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 22: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nIf at turn 23, I move right to (3,1), which is the second segment.\n\nMoving to (3,1): head moves to (3,1), which is currently occupied by the segment that was at index 1, but after move, that segment will move to where the head was? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 23, head at (2,1), positions: let's index: 0: (2,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2)\n\nIf move R to (3,1): new head at (3,1)\n\nThen new positions: head (3,1), then old head (2,1) becomes body, then segment that was 1 ( (3,1) ) but (3,1) is now head, so the body segment that was at (3,1) will move to where? After head moves to (3,1), the segment that was at position 1 ( (3,1) ) cannot stay, it must move to position 1, but position 1 is now (2,1), since old position 0 ( (2,1) ) becomes new position 1.\n\nStandard: after head moves to new cell, the new position 0 is the new head cell.\n\nThen position 1 is the old position 0.\n\nPosition 2 is old position 1.\n\nAnd so on, up to the tail, and tail removed if no food.\n\nSo here, move to (3,1): new head (3,1)\n\nNew position 1: old position 0, which is (2,1)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1, which was (3,1) but (3,1) is now head, so the segment that was at (3,1) moves to new position 2? Old position 1 was (3,1), which becomes new position 2.\n\nBut new position 2 is (3,1), but (3,1) is the head now? Conflict.\n\nPhysically: head was at (2,1), moves to (3,1). The segment that was at (3,1) needs to move to the new position of the body.\n\nWhen head moves to (3,1), the cell (3,1) was occupied by a body segment, so when head moves there, it is colliding with that body segment, because it's not the tail.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,1) from (2,1) would cause head to hit the body at (3,1), which is not tail, so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, except if it is the tail and no growth.\n\nHere, (3,1) is not the tail; tail is at (4,2). So moving to (3,1) is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, any body cell except tail is deadly to move into.\n\nIn this case, from (2,1), I cannot move right to (3,1) because it's body.\n\nI could move up or down, but direction: after moving left to (2,1), direction is L, so I can move U, D, or L, not R (opposite).\n\nU to (2,2), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1), or U to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) might be free? Snake positions: after turn 22 move to (2,1), positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), etc., so (2,2) not occupied.\n\n(1,1) not occupied.\n\nBut to reach (6,1), from (2,1), if I go up or left, I go further away, and (6,1) has short life, only until turn 28, and it might be hard to reach in time if I move away.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) to (6,1) is 4 steps, but direct path blocked by body at (3,1), so I need to go around, which takes more turns.\n\nMinimum, go up to (2,2), then right to (3,2), but (3,2) is body? After turn 22, positions include (3,2), so (3,2) occupied.\n\nAt turn 22 after move to (2,1): positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nSo (3,2) occupied.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at turn 23, then from (2,2), I can move right to (3,2)? (3,2) occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove up to (2,3), etc., but it will take many turns to go around the body to reach (6,1), and with only until turn 28, it might be tight or impossible if I move left first.\n\nWhereas if I move right to (4,1) at turn 22, I can be at (6,1) by turn 24.\n\nSo moving right seems better to get the food with short life.\n\nMoreover, (5,4) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, at turn 22, move R to (4,1).\n\nThen as before, positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nAt turn 23, from (4,1), I can move U, D, R, not L (opposite to R).\n\nU to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently tail.\n\n(4,2) is tail, so moving to it might be safe.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1)\n\nU to (4,2)\n\n(5,1) is empty, I think.\n\nTo go to (6,1), I need to move right to (5,1) or up/down, but directly, move R to (5,1).\n\nThen at turn 24, from (5,1) move R to (6,1), eat food.\n\nNow, when moving to (4,2) at turn 23: (4,2) is tail.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), which is tail, then after move, head at (4,2), and since I eat no food yet, tail moves, so no collision.\n\nBut I want to go to (6,1), so moving up to (4,2) might not be efficient.\n\nBetter to move directly right.\n\nSo at turn 23, move R to (5,1).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,1), new positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] tail at (4,3)? Old positions before move: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nAfter move to (5,1): new head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail at (4,3), since (4,2) removed.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen turn 24, move R to (6,1), eat food (6,1), value +1, snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,1), then body: since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: head (6,1), then previous head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — and the tail (4,3) stays, but since grown, we add a segment, so positions include the old tail.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the end.\n\nSo positions: new head at (6,1), then the previous segments: old head (5,1) becomes body, then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — and since grown, we keep (4,3) as tail, but it was already there, so now length 9.\n\nPrevious length 8, after eating, length 9, so tail stays, and new head.\n\nPositions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, food eaten, so (6,1) removed.\n\nNow, other food at (5,4), still available.\n\nNow, head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nI need to think beyond to maximize score and survive.\n\nBut first, let's confirm this path.\n\nAt turn 24, ate (6,1), good.\n\nNow, turn 25, head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nR to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,2)\n\nOnly U to (6,2) is possible, since R and D invalid.\n\nCannot move L because direction R, opposite? Current direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nMoves: U, D, R, but R to wall, D to wall, so only U to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) should be empty.\n\nMove to (6,2) at turn 25.\n\nThen positions: head to (6,2), no food, so snake shifts: new head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — tail at (4,4)? Old positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nAfter move to (6,2): new head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — and tail (4,3) removed, so positions: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail at (4,4).\n\nDirection U now.\n\nNow, head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nNow, I need to go to (5,4) for the other food.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is northwest from here? (6,2) to (5,4): delta x=-1, delta y=2, so not adjacent.\n\nPath: I can move left to (5,2), or up to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut also, walls and body.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (6,2): direction U, so can move U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nU to (6,3)\n\nL to (5,2)\n\nR to (7,2) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(5,2) might be empty, (6,3) empty.\n\nNow, to reach (5,4), I need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,2) at turn 26.\n\nThen from (5,2), move U to (5,3), then U to (5,4) at turn 28? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 25: at (6,2)\n\nTurn 26: move to (5,2) or (6,3)\n\nIf move L to (5,2) at turn 26.\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction L.\n\nPositions: new head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (4,4)? After move, no food, so shift: new head (5,2), then old head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — and (4,4) removed? Positions: before move: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (3,4), since (4,4) removed.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 27, from (5,2), can move U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nU to (5,3)\n\nD to (5,1) but (5,1) is body? Positions: (5,1) is in the list, so occupied.\n\nL to (4,2) or (4,2) might be free? Not in positions.\n\n(4,2) not in current positions, so free.\n\nD to (5,1) occupied, cannot.\n\nSo U to (5,3) or L to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (5,3) at turn 27.\n\nThen head to (5,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: new head (5,3), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)? After move, no food, shift: new head (5,3), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — and (3,4) removed, tail at (3,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 28, from (5,3), move U to (5,4), which is food.\n\nEat (5,4), value +1, grow.\n\nHead at (5,4), positions: new head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) — and since eaten, tail not removed, so (3,3) stays, but (3,3) was tail, now added? Positions grow: head (5,4), previous segments: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) as new tail? Length was 9, after eating, length 10.\n\nPrevious positions before eating: [ (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) ] that's 9 segments.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) and eat: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, food eaten.\n\nBut (5,4) was available until turn 31, eaten at turn 28, fine.\n\nNow, but earlier at turn 25, I had only one choice to move up to (6,2).\n\nIn this path, I ate both foods by turn 28.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nAt turn 28, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nU to (5,5)\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) is body? Current positions: (5,4) head, (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) not occupied, free.\n\n(5,5) free, (6,4) free.\n\nAlso, walls: (3,6) obstacle, but y=6, x=3.\n\nNow, I can move, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nSince I have eaten both foods, now I should just survive and not take risks.\n\nBut there might be more food later, but no, only these two given, so I need to maximize score by eating available food, but no more food mentioned, so after eating both, just survive.\n\nBut the game continues, and new food might spawn, but in this problem, only these foods are given, so I think for now, with the given, I ate both.\n\nBut at turn 22, if I move left, I might not get (6,1) in time.\n\nFor example, if move left to (2,1) at turn 22.\n\nThen positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 23, from (2,1), can move U, D, or L, not R.\n\nD to (2,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) might be free? Not occupied, so yes.\n\nSay move U to (2,2) at turn 23.\n\nThen head to (2,2), direction U.\n\nPositions: new head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)? After move, no food, shift: new head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — and (4,2) removed, tail at (4,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, to reach (6,1), which is at (6,1), I need to go right and down, but body blocks direct path.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2)? But (3,2) occupied, cannot.\n\nMove U to (2,3) or L to (1,2), etc.\n\nSay move U to (2,3) at turn 24.\n\nThen to (2,4), etc., but (6,1) is at y=1, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nBut y=1 is row above bottom.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move right to (3,3), but (3,3) occupied? Current positions after turn 24: head at (2,3) if moved, but let's not simulate all.\n\nThe point is, to reach (6,1) from west, I need to go around the body, which might take many turns, and with only until turn 28, it might not be reachable in time.\n\nFor example, shortest path: from (2,1) to (6,1) is distance 4, but blocked, so need to go north then east, but body occupies x=3 y=1 to4, so I need to go above y=4 or below, but below y=1 is wall, so must go above.\n\nSay to (2,4) or something, then to (3,4), but (3,4) occupied, to (4,4) occupied, etc.\n\nThe free cells are left and above.\n\nFor instance, from (2,1), move U to (2,2) turn23, then U to (2,3) turn24, then R to (3,3)? (3,3) occupied at that time.\n\nAt turn24, positions: if head at (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — (4,3) was tail but removed? After turn23 move to (2,2), positions [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nTurn24 move to (2,3): new head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,3) removed? New positions: [ (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail (4,4)\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nCannot move to (3,3).\n\nMove to (1,3) or (2,4), etc.\n\nIt will take at least 4 or 5 turns to reach (6,1), but from (2,3) to (6,1), say move R to (3,3) impossible, so move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\nSay move to (2,4) at turn24, then to (3,4) but (3,4) occupied? At turn24 positions, (3,4) is occupied.\n\n(4,4) occupied.\n\nSo I need to go to (1,y) or (5,y) but (5,y) not reached.\n\nThis is messy, and (6,1) might expire before I reach.\n\nWhereas by moving right at turn22, I get it easily.\n\nTherefore, better to move right at turn22 to get the short-life food.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAfter eating both, at turn28, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nI can move to (5,5), or (4,4), or (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is free now? Positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,4) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (6,4) free.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (3,6), but y=6.\n\nI need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,5), then I might go to top, but walls.\n\nSince the snake is long, I should move to open spaces.\n\nFor instance, move L to (4,4) at turn29.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left.\n\nBut let's not plan too far, since the question is to think 5+ turns ahead from turn22.\n\nFrom turn22, thinking to turn27 or so.\n\nIn the first path, by turn24 I ate first food, turn28 second food.\n\nBut at turn25, when at (6,1), I had to move up to (6,2), which is fine.\n\nIs there a risk in moving right at turn22?\n\nOne thing: at turn22, if I move right to (4,1), which is tail, but safe.\n\nThen turn23 move to (5,1), safe.\n\nTurn24 to (6,1), eat.\n\nThen turn25 to (6,2), only choice.\n\nTurn26, I could have moved to (5,2) or (6,3), I chose (5,2) to go to food.\n\nBut I could go to (6,3) as well.\n\nBut (5,4) is at y=4, so going to (6,3) might be slower.\n\nIn my earlier, I went to (5,2) then up.\n\nIf at turn26 from (6,2), I move U to (6,3), then to (6,4), then left to (5,4), but (5,4) is at (5,4), so from (6,4) to (5,4) is left, but direction might not allow.\n\nAt turn25, after moving to (6,2), direction U.\n\nTurn26, from (6,2), move U to (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn27, move U to (6,4), direction U.\n\nThen turn28, from (6,4), can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (6,5), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo move L to (5,4) at turn28, eat food.\n\nSame as before, ate at turn28.\n\nBut in this case, I went to (6,4) first.\n\nBut (5,4) eaten at turn28, fine.\n\nIn the first path, I ate at turn28 from below.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in the first path, when I moved to (5,2) at turn26, then to (5,3), to (5,4), it worked.\n\nNow, the only potential issue is after eating at (5,4), I am at (5,4) with body around.\n\nBut I can move away.\n\nFor example, to (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut since no more food, I can just move to survive.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I have to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but doesn't specify how many.\n\nProbably I need to output a sequence for a few turns, but since I need to think ahead, I should output until I eat the foods or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I can output the actions to get to the food.\n\nSince moving right at turn22 is crucial for the short-life food, I should do that.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? For example, if moving right causes danger later.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (4,1), at turn23, I move to (5,1), then to (6,1), no problem.\n\nThen to (6,2), then to (5,2), etc., all seem safe.\n\nThe internal wall at (3,6) is not in the way.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but no food on tail, so ok.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (4,1) at turn22, the head is now at (4,1), and the tail was there, but moved, so no issue.\n\nThen, at turn23, when at (4,1), I move to (5,1), which is adjacent to (4,1), but no problem.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn22, action should be R (right).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to output actions up to, say, turn24 or more.\n\nBut the output should be a sequence.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, output for 5 turns or so.\n\nFrom turn22 to, say, turn26.\n\nBut turn22: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn23: from (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn24: from (5,1), move R to (6,1), eat food.\n\nThen turn25: from (6,1), move U to (6,2) only choice.\n\nTurn26: from (6,2), I can move to (5,2) or (6,3). Since I want to go to (5,4), moving to (5,2) is better, as in the first path.\n\nIn the state, there is also the internal obstacle at (3,6), but not relevant now.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (6,1) at turn24, I eat food, and the head is at (6,1), which is near the wall.\n\nBut I move up immediately.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) has longer life, so I don't have to rush, but in this case, I can get it by turn28.\n\nIf I delay, it might be riskier, but since I can get it, better to eat.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn22 to turn25, I have actions.\n\nBut turn26 onwards, I need to go to (5,4).\n\nBut let's list actions up to turn26 or so.\n\nSince the question says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", and I eat both, it should be good.\n\nBut to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output from turn22 to when I eat the second food, but that might be long.\n\nSince the output format is open, I think output for 5 turns: turn22 to turn26.\n\nAt turn26, in the first path, I was at (5,2) or (6,3), but let's choose (5,2).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 22: R (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 23: R (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 24: R (to (6,1), eat)\n\nTurn 25: U (to (6,2), only choice)\n\nTurn 26: L (to (5,2))\n\nThen turn27: U to (5,3), turn28: U to (5,4), but that's beyond 5 turns.\n\nFor 5+ turns, I can output up to turn26.\n\nBut at turn26, after moving to (5,2), I can choose to go up.\n\nIn the state, after turn24, I ate first food, but second food still there.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think outputting the critical moves is fine.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to specify.\n\nIn turn23, from (4,1), direction R, move R to (5,1), valid.\n\nTurn24, from (5,1), direction R, move R to (6,1), valid.\n\nTurn25, from (6,1), direction R, only U possible, move U.\n\nTurn26, from (6,2), direction U, move L to (5,2), since I want to go left.\n\nI could move U to (6,3), but L is better for (5,4).\n\nNow, to confirm the grid.\n\nAnother thing: at (5,2), when I move there, is it safe? Yes.\n\nNow, but in the initial state, snake positions: let's list all cells to see free space.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,6).\n\nFree cells: except snake and walls.\n\nBut snake occupies: (3,1) to (3,4), (4,1) to (4,4), but not all, specific positions.\n\nIn row y=1: cells x=0,1,2,5,6,7? x=0 wall, x=1 free, x=2 free, x=3 snake head, x=4 snake tail? At start, x=3 and x=4 y=1 both snake.\n\nBut after moves, changes.\n\nI think the path is fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: R\n\nTurn 24: R\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nAnd for turn27, but not necessary.\n\nSince think 5+ turns, output 5 actions: turn22 to 26.\n\nBut turn26 is t1+4, since t1=22, t1+1=23, t1+2=24, t1+3=25, t1+4=26.\n\n5 turns: 22,23,24,25,26.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn26, I move L to (5,2), which is towards (5,4).\n\nTo be complete.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, in the food, both positive, no negative mentioned.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nBut earlier I considered moving left, but it seems inferior.\n\nSo final decision.\n\nAnswer in boxed.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves prioritizing the food at (6,1) due to its shorter life span (7 turns, must be eaten by turn 28). Moving right immediately at turn 22 allows the snake to reach (6,1) efficiently by turn 24. After eating (6,1), the snake proceeds to eat the second food at (5,4) by turn 28, leveraging its longer life span (10 turns). The sequence below is planned for 5 turns (turns 22 to 26) to cover the critical path to the first food and initiate movement toward the second, thinking 5+ turns ahead to avoid risks and ensure both foods are eaten safely.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 22 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (3,1), direction down (D).\n  - Cannot move down (wall at y=0) or up (opposite direction).\n  - Moving left (L) to (2,1) is safe but moves away from (6,1), risking missing it due to short life span.\n  - Moving right (R) to (4,1) is safe (currently the tail, which moves away) and positions the snake to reach (6,1) quickly.\n- **Turn 23**: From (4,1), direction right (R). Move right (R) to (5,1) to continue toward (6,1). This is safe and efficient.\n- **Turn 24**: From (5,1), direction right (R). Move right (R) to (6,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). No tail reward danger (not adjacent to tail).\n- **Turn 25**: From (6,1), direction right (R). Cannot move right (x=7 wall) or down (y=0 wall); moving left (L) is opposite direction and invalid. Only move is up (U) to (6,2) to avoid walls and open paths for future moves.\n- **Turn 26**: From (6,2), direction up (U). Move left (L) to (5,2) to start heading toward (5,4). This avoids dead ends and keeps the snake in open space.\n\n### Sequence for Turns 22–26:\n- Turn 22: Move right (R) to (4,1) to target (6,1) efficiently.\n- Turn 23: Move right (R) to (5,1) to continue path to (6,1).\n- Turn 24: Move right (R) to (6,1) to eat food and grow.\n- Turn 25: Move up (U) to (6,2) (only safe move).\n- Turn 26: Move left (L) to (5,2) to begin approach to (5,4).\n\n### Beyond Turn 26 (for completeness, not output):\n- Turn 27: From (5,2), direction left (L). Move up (U) to (5,3) to continue toward (5,4).\n- Turn 28: From (5,3), direction up (U). Move up (U) to (5,4) to eat food (+1 score, snake grows).\n\nThis plan eats both foods by turn 28, maximizing score while avoiding collisions and walls. After turn 28, the snake should prioritize survival by moving to open areas (e.g., (4,4) or (5,5)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: R \\\\\nTurn 23: R \\\\\nTurn 24: R \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 23, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but here it says U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up. Let me confirm.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards. D is (x,y-1), so y decreases downwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, and (7,7) is top-right.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So we can't move to those coordinates. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head at (4,1), then body segments: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). So let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,2)  // that's the tail, I think.\n\nPositions: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nSo head is (4,1), tail is (4,2). Length is 8 segments.\n\nNow, head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (6,1) with life_span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- Another at (5,4) with life_span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife_span: for (6,1), life_span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn. Similarly for (5,4), life_span 9.\n\nCurrent turn is 23, so food at (6,1) will disappear after turn 23 + 6 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,1), life_span=6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. So it will be gone after turn 28? Turn 23: countdown 6, turn 24: 5, ..., turn 28: 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 29 or after turn 28? The countdown decreases every turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nTypically, it might be that at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so for turn t, if life_span starts at N, after N turns, it's gone.\n\nLet's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn t, countdown decreases by one at some point.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that food with life_span N on turn t will disappear after turn t + N - 1. For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can only eat it this turn.\n\nFor (6,1), N=6 on turn 23, so countdown: turn 23: 6, turn 24:5, ..., turn 28:1, turn 29:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 23 to 28 inclusive? On turn 28, countdown is 1, decreases to 0, so eaten on turn 28 is possible, but not on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,4), N=9, disappears after turn 31? Turn 23:9, turn24:8, ..., turn31:1, turn32:0 gone. So can be eaten turns 23 to 31.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,1), direction R (right).\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut head direction is R, so I can't move left (opposite) immediately? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so next turn, I cannot move L (left). So from (4,1), possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). L is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake body: let's map the grid to see where the snake is.\n\nI should draw a grid mentally.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7):\n\nRow y=7: top\n\ny=0: bottom\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (4,1) head\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,2) tail\n\nNow, let's list all occupied cells:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,1) is head, but it's occupied by head now.\n\nAlso, food at (6,1) and (5,4)\n\n(6,1) is at x=6,y=1\n\n(5,4) at x=5,y=4\n\nNow, from head (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,1+1) = (4,2) but (4,2) is currently occupied by the tail? (4,2) is a body segment, but it's the tail.\n\nImportant rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other body segments is deadly.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible cells:\n\n- U: (4,2) - currently occupied by tail (4,2), so if I move there, since tail moves, it might be ok? But let's see.\n\nWhen I move, the snake moves: head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo if I move U to (4,2), which is currently the tail position.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,2), then the segment that was at (4,2) is now the new tail? Let's think.\n\nSnake positions before: [H: (4,1), B1: (3,1), B2: (3,2), B3: (3,3), B4: (3,4), B5: (4,4), B6: (4,3), T: (4,2)]\n\nIf I move head to (4,2), then:\n\nNew head at (4,2)\n\nThen body: B1 moves to where head was? No.\n\nThe body segments follow: the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to old first body, etc.\n\nStandard snake movement:\n\n- New head position: based on move.\n\n- Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: index 0: head, 1,2,3,... to tail.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New position 0: the new head cell.\n\n- Position 1: old position 0\n\n- Position 2: old position 1\n\n- ...\n\n- Position k: old position k-1 for k>0\n\n- The last position (tail) is discarded if no food eaten, or new segment added if food eaten.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet, so tail is removed.\n\nSo if I move U to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- Then segment 1 (was (3,1)) moves to old head (4,1)\n\n- Segment 2 (was (3,2)) moves to old seg1 (3,1)\n\n- Segment 3 (was (3,3)) moves to old seg2 (3,2)\n\n- Segment 4 (was (3,4)) moves to old seg3 (3,3)\n\n- Segment 5 (was (4,4)) moves to old seg4 (3,4)\n\n- Segment 6 (was (4,3)) moves to old seg5 (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7 (was (4,2)) moves to old seg6 (4,3) — but (4,2) was the tail, and it moves to (4,3)\n\nAfter move, the tail is gone, so new positions: head at (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), and the old (4,3) is now the tail? Let's list:\n\nOld positions: [0:(4,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(3,2), 3:(3,3), 4:(3,4), 5:(4,4), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,2)]\n\nMove U: new head at (4,2)\n\nThen:\n\n- New pos0: (4,2)  // head\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (4,1)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (3,1)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (3,2)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (3,3)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (3,4)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,3)  // tail\n\nOld pos7 was (4,2), but since no food, tail is not grown, so we have 8 segments still? Old snake had 8 segments, after move without eating, it should have same length, tail moves, so new snake has head and 7 body segments? No.\n\nNumber of segments: initially 8 positions. After move, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so new snake has 7 segments? But in the positions, we have from index 0 to 7, 8 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating food:\n\n- Head moves to new position\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\n- The last segment (tail) is not replaced, so the snake shortens by one? No.\n\nStandard: if no food, the tail is left behind, so the snake moves forward, tail is not there, so new positions are: new head, then the first N-1 segments of old, so length decreases by one? But that can't be right for snake game.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nIn snake, when no food is eaten, the snake moves: the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it, and the tail cell is vacated. So the snake length remains the same, but it moves.\n\nFor example, old positions: [A, B, C, D] where A head, D tail.\n\nMove to new head E.\n\nThen new positions: [E, A, B, C] and D is gone. So from 4 segments, after move, still 4 segments: E (head), A (body), B (body), C (tail).\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nIn this case, 8 segments: indices 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head at new position\n\n- New position 1: old position 0\n\n- New position 2: old position 1\n\n- ...\n\n- New position 7: old position 6\n\nOld position 7 is not used, it is vacated.\n\nSo new snake has positions: new head, then old 0 to 6.\n\nSo for 8 segments, new snake: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_body6] where old_body6 was the segment before tail.\n\nIn our list: positions 0 to 7, pos0 head, pos7 tail.\n\nAfter move no eat: new pos0 = new head\n\nnew pos1 = old pos0\n\nnew pos2 = old pos1\n\n...\n\nnew pos7 = old pos6\n\nOld pos7 is abandoned.\n\nSo in this case, from (4,1) move U to (4,2):\n\n- new pos0: (4,2)  // head\n\n- new pos1: old pos0 = (4,1)  // was head, now body\n\n- new pos2: old pos1 = (3,1)  // was body, still body\n\n- new pos3: old pos2 = (3,2)\n\n- new pos4: old pos3 = (3,3)\n\n- new pos5: old pos4 = (3,4)\n\n- new pos6: old pos5 = (4,4)\n\n- new pos7: old pos6 = (4,3)  // new tail, since old pos6 was (4,3)\n\nOld pos6 was (4,3), which is now new pos7, tail.\n\nAnd old pos7 (4,2) is now empty.\n\nBut (4,2) was the cell we moved to, so it's now head.\n\nIn terms of collision, when moving to (4,2), it was occupied by tail, but since tail moves away, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a body segment, it would be collision.\n\nBack to possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,2) - currently tail, so safe to move there.\n\n- D: (4,0) - but y=0 is wall, so cannot move there, deadly.\n\n- L: (3,1) - but (3,1) is body segment, not tail, so if I move there, it's collision. Also, (3,1) is the first body segment, so it's occupied, and since it's not tail, moving there would cause head to touch body, death.\n\n- R: (5,1) - is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nCurrent occupied: snake cells: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nFood at (6,1) and (5,4), but food cells are not occupied by snake, so can move there, and if head moves to food, eat it.\n\nAlso walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,6)\n\nSo (5,1): x=5,y=1, not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (4,1), (3,1), etc., but not (5,1). (5,1) is empty, I think.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(5,1): not a wall, not occupied by snake, so free cell.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,2) - currently tail, safe\n\n- D: (4,0) - y=0 wall, invalid, death\n\n- L: (3,1) - body segment, collision, death\n\n- R: (5,1) - free cell, safe\n\nSo only U and R are safe moves. D and L are deadly.\n\nNow, head direction is R, so moving U or R is allowed, since not reverse. Reverse would be L, which is not possible anyway.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (6,1) and (5,4).\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), which is to the right of head (4,1), so same row y=1.\n\nDistance: from (4,1) to (6,1) is 2 steps right.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is up and right from (4,1).\n\n(4,1) to (5,4): delta x=1, delta y=3, so not adjacent.\n\nNow, life_span: (6,1) has life 6, so can be eaten until turn 28.\n\n(5,4) has life 9, until turn 31.\n\nCurrent turn 23.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (4,2), head at (4,1), so adjacent? Positions: head (4,1), tail (4,2), which are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut the food is not on tail; food is at (6,1) and (5,4), not on tail.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nBut I need to consider future states.\n\nSince I have to output actions for several turns, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nMake a grid:\n\ny\\ x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n7 | . . . . . . . .   y=7 top\n\n6 | . . . W . . . .   W at (3,6)\n\n5 | . . . . . . . .\n\n4 | . . . . . F . .   F at (5,4)\n\n3 | . . . B B B . .   B snake: (3,3),(3,4)? Snake at (3,3),(3,4),(4,4),(4,3), etc.\n\nList per cell:\n\nCell (x,y):\n\n(3,1): snake body\n\n(3,2): snake body\n\n(3,3): snake body\n\n(3,4): snake body\n\n(4,1): snake head\n\n(4,2): snake tail\n\n(4,3): snake body\n\n(4,4): snake body\n\n(5,4): food\n\n(6,1): food\n\n(3,6): wall\n\nAlso, borders walls.\n\nNow, head at (4,1), dir R.\n\nSafe moves: U or R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,1): that's free, no food, so snake moves, head to (5,1), body to (4,1), etc., tail at old (4,3)? After move R to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (4,1)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (3,1)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (3,2)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (3,3)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (3,4)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,3)  // tail, since old pos6 was (4,3)\n\nOld pos7 (4,2) vacated.\n\nNow, (5,1) has no food, so no eat.\n\nThen head at (5,1), direction? I moved R, so direction is R.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nD: (5,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL: (4,1) which is now body segment (new pos1), so if move there, collision.\n\nU: (5,2) - what is there? Currently, after move, cells: (5,1) head, (4,1) body, (3,1) body, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\n(5,2) is empty, I think.\n\nSimilarly R: (6,1) which has food.\n\n(6,1) is food, so if move to (6,1), eat food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to current turn, I have two choices: U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2): currently tail.\n\nAfter move U to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New pos1: (4,1)  // old head\n\n- New pos2: (3,1)  // old pos1\n\n- New pos3: (3,2)  // old pos2\n\n- New pos4: (3,3)  // old pos3\n\n- New pos5: (3,4)  // old pos4\n\n- New pos6: (4,4)  // old pos5\n\n- New pos7: (4,3)  // old pos6, tail\n\nOld pos7 (4,2) is now head.\n\n(4,2) had no food, so no eat.\n\nHead now at (4,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nL: (3,2) which is body segment (new pos3? Positions: head (4,2), pos1 (4,1), pos2 (3,1), pos3 (3,2), etc. So (3,2) is occupied, not tail, so collision if move L.\n\nR: (5,2) - empty?\n\nD: (4,1) which is body (new pos1), collision.\n\nU: (4,3) which is tail? new pos7 is (4,3), tail.\n\n(4,3) is the new tail position.\n\nSo if move U to (4,3), it is tail, so safe.\n\nBut (4,3) has no food.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3) tail, safe; or R to (5,2) if free; L and D not possible.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, R to (5,2).\n\nNow, compare the two options at turn 23.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,1)\n\nThen head at (5,1), dir R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1) to eat food, or D to (5,0) invalid, L to (4,1) body, invalid.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,1), I eat the food at (6,1).\n\nSince value +1, snake grows.\n\nLife_span 6, so it can be eaten now.\n\nIf I eat at (6,1), then after moving to (6,1), head there, and since food eaten, a new tail segment is added, so snake length increases.\n\nSpecifically: after moving to food cell, the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, from (5,1) move R to (6,1):\n\nNew head at (6,1)\n\nThen body: new pos1: old head (5,1)\n\nnew pos2: old pos1 (4,1)\n\netc., up to new pos7: old pos6 (4,3)? And since food eaten, add a new segment at the old tail position.\n\nOld tail was (4,3), so new positions: new head (6,1), then new pos1 to new pos7: old pos0 to old pos6, and new pos8: old pos7 (which was tail, (4,3)? Let's see.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, after moving head to food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail is not removed; instead, it stays, so the new snake has an additional segment.\n\nPositions: after move to food:\n\n- New head: food cell\n\n- New pos1: old pos0\n\n- ...\n\n- New posk: old pos_{k-1} for k=1 to len\n\n- And new tail: old tail position? No.\n\nIf no eat, new positions are [new_head, old_pos0, old_pos1, ..., old_pos_{n-2}] for n segments.\n\nWith eat: [new_head, old_pos0, old_pos1, ..., old_pos_{n-1}] so length n+1.\n\nFor example, 8 segments, after eat, 9 segments.\n\nIn this case, old positions: 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move to food:\n\n- New pos0: (6,1)  // head\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (5,1)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (4,1)  // from previous, but we are at (5,1) now, let's sequence.\n\nSuppose at turn, before move, head at (5,1), positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] // tail at (4,3)\n\nMove R to (6,1), which has food.\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nThen:\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (5,1)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (4,1)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (3,1)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (3,2)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (3,3)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (3,4)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 = (4,3)  // and since food eaten, no removal, so this is part of body, and new tail? New pos8 is the last segment.\n\nActually, with food eaten, the old tail position is not vacated; it becomes the new segment.\n\nSo new snake has 9 segments: head at (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) was not the old tail; old tail was (4,3), and it is now the new tail? In new positions, (4,3) is the last, tail.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction R, cannot move L (left).\n\nD: (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nU: (6,2) - free?\n\nR: (7,1) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL: (5,1) which is now body segment, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (5,4).\n\nNow back to current choice.\n\nIf at turn 23 I move U to (4,2), then head to (4,2), dir U.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) which is tail, safe, or R to (5,2) free.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), it's tail, so safe, no eat.\n\nThen head at (4,3), dir U.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), which is body? After previous move, positions: from (4,2) move U to (4,3):\n\n- New head (4,3)\n\n- New pos1: (4,2)  // old head\n\n- New pos2: (4,1)  // old pos1? Let's keep track.\n\nAfter turn 23 move U to (4,2):\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail? Earlier calculation.\n\nFrom turn 23 start: positions [ (4,1)H, (3,1)B1, (3,2)B2, (3,3)B3, (3,4)B4, (4,4)B5, (4,3)B6, (4,2)T ]\n\nMove U: new head (4,2) -- but (4,2) was T, now head.\n\nNew pos1: old H (4,1)\n\nNew pos2: old B1 (3,1)\n\nNew pos3: old B2 (3,2)\n\nNew pos4: old B3 (3,3)\n\nNew pos5: old B4 (3,4)\n\nNew pos6: old B5 (4,4)\n\nNew pos7: old B6 (4,3)  // tail\n\nSo positions: H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(3,1), B3(3,2), B4(3,3), B5(3,4), B6(4,4), T(4,3)\n\nT at (4,3)\n\nFrom here, move U to (4,3): (4,3) is tail, so safe.\n\nNew head (4,3)\n\nNew pos1: old H (4,2)\n\nNew pos2: old B1 (4,1)\n\nNew pos3: old B2 (3,1)\n\nNew pos4: old B3 (3,2)\n\nNew pos5: old B4 (3,3)\n\nNew pos6: old B5 (3,4)\n\nNew pos7: old B6 (4,4)  // tail\n\nOld T (4,3) is now head.\n\nNo food at (4,3), so no eat.\n\nHead at (4,3), dir U.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), which is now body (new pos7? Positions: H(4,3), B1(4,2), B2(4,1), B3(3,1), B4(3,2), B5(3,3), B6(3,4), T(4,4)\n\n(4,4) is tail.\n\nSo U to (4,4) is tail, safe.\n\nR to (5,3) free?\n\nD to (4,2) which is body, collision.\n\nL to (3,3) which is body (B5? (3,3) is B5, not tail, collision.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I keep moving up, I might get stuck.\n\nBut there's food at (5,4), which is above.\n\n(5,4) is food.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move R to (5,3), then to (5,4) next move.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,1), which is closer.\n\n(6,1) is at distance 2 right, while (5,4) is at distance |dx=1, dy=1| so 2 moves, but not direct.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,1) is 2 right, to (5,4) is one right and three up, so longer path.\n\nBut (6,1) has shorter life, life_span 6 vs 9 for (5,4).\n\nTurn 23, (6,1) disappears after turn 28, so must be eaten by turn 28.\n\n(5,4) by turn 31.\n\nI should go for (6,1) first since it's closer and might expire soon.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIf I move R at turn 23 to (5,1), then at turn 24, I can move R to (6,1) to eat it.\n\nThen I get +1 score.\n\nIf I move U at turn 23 to (4,2), then at turn 24, I might move R to (5,2) or U to (4,3), then to reach (6,1) it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) move R to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can move D to (5,1) or U to (5,3), etc., to reach (6,1) might take longer.\n\nSpecifically, from (5,2) to (6,1) is not adjacent; (6,1) is down-right or something.\n\n(5,2) to (6,1) is R and D, but not adjacent, so two moves: e.g., R to (6,2) then D to (6,1), or D to (5,1) then R to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut (6,1) might be eaten on turn 24 if I go right first.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,1), I am at (6,1), and can only move U to (6,2), then I can go towards (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is higher y.\n\nNow, the internal wall at (3,6), but not affecting directly.\n\nI need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (6,1), the snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n\nBut currently, the area around is not too crowded.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, I should go for the closer food (6,1).\n\nSo at turn 23, move R to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 24, move R to (6,1) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,1), snake longer: positions as above, tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nThen from (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2), since other directions blocked.\n\nMove U to (6,2), no food there, so just move.\n\nHead to (6,2), dir U.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nDirection U, so cannot D.\n\nD: (6,1) which is body, collision.\n\nL: (5,2) free?\n\nR: (7,2) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU: (6,3) free.\n\nSo can move L to (5,2) or U to (6,3).\n\nNow, I need to go to (5,4) for the other food.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), so from (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), then U to (5,3), then U to (5,4) to eat.\n\n(5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food, life_span 9, so on turn 24, life_span decreases to 8, etc., still time.\n\nTurn 24: after eating (6,1) at turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: move to (6,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (6,2)\n\nNow turn 25: head at (6,2), dir U.\n\nFood at (5,4) still there, life_span 9 on turn 23, turn 24:8, turn 25:7, etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2) or U to (6,3).\n\nIf I move L to (5,2), then from (5,2), dir L? Moved L, so direction L.\n\nThen can move U, D, L, R, but direction L, cannot R.\n\nD: (5,1) which may be body; let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 24: ate at (6,1), positions: H(6,1), B1(5,1), B2(4,1), B3(3,1), B4(3,2), B5(3,3), B6(3,4), B7(4,4), T(4,3)? Earlier.\n\nAfter eating at turn 24: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail. 9 segments.\n\nTurn 25: move U to (6,2), no food.\n\nNew head (6,2)\n\nNew pos1: old H (6,1)\n\nNew pos2: old B1 (5,1)\n\nNew pos3: old B2 (4,1)\n\nNew pos4: old B3 (3,1)\n\nNew pos5: old B4 (3,2)\n\nNew pos6: old B5 (3,3)\n\nNew pos7: old B6 (3,4)\n\nNew pos8: old B7 (4,4)  // tail\n\nOld T (4,3) vacated?

And new pos9: old tail position.\n\nOld tail was (3,3), so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), and new tail at (3,3)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (5,4) with eat:\n\n- New pos0: (5,4) head\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 (5,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 (5,2)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 (6,2)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 (6,1)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 (5,1)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 (4,1)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 (3,1)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 (3,2)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 (3,3)  // since food eaten, old tail becomes body, and new tail is old tail? No.\n\nWith eat: the old tail is not removed, so new snake has all old segments plus head at new position.\n\nOld positions before move: head (5,3), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail (3,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,4) eat:\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- New pos1: old head (5,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 (5,2)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 (6,2)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 (6,1)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 (5,1)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 (4,1)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 (3,1)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 (3,2)\n\n- New pos9: old tail (3,3)  // new tail\n\nSo tail at (3,3)\n\nNow, ate both foods, score +2.\n\nBut this is if I go right first.\n\nNow, what if I go up first at turn 23?\n\nMove U to (4,2) at turn 23.\n\nThen head at (4,2), dir U.\n\nTurn 24: I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), for example.\n\nThen head to (5,2), dir R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go to (6,1) or to (5,3) etc.\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), from (5,2), I can move D to (5,1) then R to (6,1), or R to (6,2) then D to (6,1), but (6,1) might be expired if late.\n\nTurn 23: move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: say move R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 25: from (5,2), I can move D to (5,1) if free, then to (6,1).\n\nBut (5,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 23 move U: positions as before, H(4,2), B1(4,1), B2(3,1), B3(3,2), B4(3,3), B5(3,4), B6(4,4), T(4,3)\n\nTurn 24 move R to (5,2): new head (5,2), new pos1: (4,2), new pos2: (4,1), new pos3: (3,1), new pos4: (3,2), new pos5: (3,3), new pos6: (3,4), new pos7: (4,4), new tail: old T? New pos7: old B6 (4,4), tail at (4,4)\n\nOld T (4,3) vacated.\n\nNow (5,2) no food.\n\nHead at (5,2), dir R.\n\nTurn 25: move D to (5,1) -- is (5,1) free? In positions, we have (4,1) and (3,1), but not (5,1), so free.\n\nMove D to (5,1), no food? (5,1) has no food, food is at (6,1).\n\nNew head (5,1), new pos1: (5,2), etc.\n\nThen turn 26: move R to (6,1) to eat, if still there.\n\nBut (6,1) life_span: on turn 23:6, turn24:5, turn25:4, turn26:3, so on turn 26 it is still there, countdown=3.\n\nEat at turn 26.\n\nBut compared to first approach, I ate at turn 24, now turn 26, later but still within life.\n\nThen similarly, I can go to (5,4).\n\nBut the first approach seems more efficient, eating (6,1) earlier.\n\nMoreover, in the first approach, after eating (6,1), I went up to (6,2), then left to (5,2), up to (5,3), up to (5,4) to eat on turn 28.\n\nIn second approach, if I go up first, I might eat (6,1) later and (5,4) later.\n\nBut (5,4) has longer life, so it might be ok.\n\nHowever, I need to consider risks.\n\nFor example, after moving up, the snake body might block paths.\n\nIn the current state, moving right to (5,1) seems safe.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (3,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: but not applicable now.\n\nI think going for (6,1) first is better.\n\nMoreover, if I don't go for it, it might expire or I might not get it.\n\nBut with life_span 6, I have until turn 28.\n\nIn the up-first path, I can still get it by turn 26.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions starting from turn 23.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nAnswer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means plan at least 5 turns in the simulation.\n\nSince I need to output for several turns, I can do up to when I eat the second food or something.\n\nBut the state might change with new food, but here no new food mentioned, so only these two.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with the first plan.\n\nSo turn 23: move R to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 24: move R to (6,1) to eat\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (6,2)\n\nThen I need to go to (5,4).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2) on turn 26, then U to (5,3) on turn 27, then U to (5,4) on turn 28 to eat.\n\nBut on turn 28, (5,4) is still there? Life_span 9 on turn 23, turn 24:8, ..., turn 28:4, so yes.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), I need to think further, but perhaps I can stop there or continue.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, but no more food, so after eating both, I just survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 23 to 27 or something.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nAlso, in turn 25, after moving to (6,2), I could move U to (6,3) instead of L, but that might delay going to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is farther from (5,4), so better to go left.\n\nNow, another risk: when I move to (5,4), from (5,3), moving U to (5,4), but is there any danger?\n\n(5,4) is food, so eat it.\n\nBut the body: at that time, positions as above, should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 28, eating (5,4), no issue.\n\nBut I should confirm if (5,4) can be eaten safely.\n\nAlso, food under body? But (5,4) is not under snake now.\n\nInitially, snake has (4,4) and (3,4), but (5,4) is free.\n\nIn the path, it should be ok.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to write actions.\n\nBut at turn 23, I have two choices, but I think R is better.\n\nIf I move U at turn 23, I might go towards (5,4) directly, but (5,4) is farther.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) move U to (4,3), then to (4,4) but (4,4) is body? After turn 23 move U to (4,2), then turn 24 move U to (4,3), which is tail, safe.\n\nThen head at (4,3), dir U.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (4,4)? But (4,4) is body? Positions: after turn 24 move U to (4,3): H(4,3), B1(4,2), B2(4,1), B3(3,1), B4(3,2), B5(3,3), B6(3,4), T(4,4)  // since (4,4) was body, now tail.\n\n(4,4) is tail now.\n\nSo move U to (4,4): tail, safe, no eat.\n\nThen head at (4,4), dir U.\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), free? Or R to (5,4) which has food.\n\n(5,4) is adjacent right.\n\nSo move R to (5,4) to eat on turn 26.\n\nThen I eat (5,4) earlier, but (6,1) might not be eaten if I don't go for it.\n\n(6,1) expires after turn 28, on turn 26 I can still go, but from (4,4) or after eating (5,4), it might be harder to reach (6,1) with longer snake.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4) at turn 26, head at (5,4), then I need to go to (6,1), which is down-left.\n\nBut body might be in the way.\n\nIn positions: after eating (5,4), snake longer, and the body is around (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision, or U to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen to reach (6,1), it might take more turns and risk collision.\n\nWhereas in the first approach, I get (6,1) first quickly and then (5,4).\n\nSince (6,1) expires sooner, it's better to get it first.\n\nAlso, score-wise, same, but timing.\n\nSo I think moving right at turn 23 is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 23: R (right)\n\nTurn 24: R (to eat (6,1))\n\nThen turn 25: U (up to (6,2))\n\nThen turn 26: L (left to (5,2))\n\nTurn 27: U (up to (5,3))\n\nTurn 28: U (up to (5,4) to eat)\n\nBut I need to output for turns starting from 23.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should do at least 5 turns: turn 23 to 27 or 28.\n\nTurn 23,24,25,26,27: that's 5 turns.\n\nI can do more.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 28 is when I eat the second food.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll do from turn 23 to 27, and implicitly continue.\n\nSince after turn 25 I have moves, but let's list.\n\nIn turn 25, after moving U to (6,2), I said move L to (5,2) on turn 26.\n\nBut from (6,2), I could move U to (6,3), but that delays going to (5,4), so L is better.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nNow, about the head direction: when I move, direction changes.\n\nFor example, turn 23: move R, direction becomes R.\n\nTurn 24: move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 25: move U, so direction becomes U.\n\nThen turn 26: move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 27: move U, direction U.\n\nAll fine, no instant reverse.\n\nIn turn 26, from (6,2) move L to (5,2), direction L, then turn 27 move U to (5,3), which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 23: R\n\nTurn 24: R\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nBut on turn 27, I move to (5,3), then on turn 28 I move to (5,4) to eat, but I don't have to include turn 28 in the answer if I stop at 27.\n\nSince the user might expect actions until the food or something.\n\nBut the answer format doesn't specify, so I'll do 5 turns: 23 to 27.\n\nTo be complete, I can do until turn 28.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 26, when I move L to (5,2), is (5,2) free? In the sequence, yes.\n\nSimilarly, no walls or obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), far away.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while avoiding risks, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the food at (6,1) first due to its shorter life-span (it disappears after turn 28), and then proceed to the food at (5,4) which has a longer life-span (disappears after turn 31). The snake must avoid collisions with walls, its own body (except the tail when moving onto it safely), and internal obstacles. The current head direction is right (R), so reverse moves (left, L) are not allowed on the next turn.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 23)**:\n  - Head position: (4,1), direction R.\n  - Safe moves from (4,1): U (to (4,2), currently tail) or R (to (5,1), free cell). D (to (4,0), wall) and L (to (3,1), body collision) are deadly.\n  - Food at (6,1): Life-span 6, must be eaten by turn 28. Distance: 2 steps right.\n  - Food at (5,4): Life-span 9, must be eaten by turn 31. Distance: Requires multiple moves (e.g., right and up).\n- **Strategy**:\n  - **Immediate (Turns 23-24)**: Move right to (5,1) on turn 23, then right to (6,1) on turn 24 to eat the first food. This is efficient as (6,1) is closer and expires sooner.\n  - **Post-Eating (6,1)**: After eating, the snake grows by 1 segment. From (6,1), only U is safe (to (6,2)) due to walls and body collisions.\n  - **Path to (5,4)**: From (6,2), move left to (5,2) (turn 26), then up to (5,3) (turn 27), and finally up to (5,4) to eat on turn 28. This path avoids the body and walls.\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - Moving to the tail (e.g., (4,2) on turn 23) is safe but delays reaching (6,1), increasing risk of missing it.\n  - After eating (6,1), the body extends, but moving up then left keeps the head clear of collisions.\n  - No tail reward danger issues, as food is not on the tail.\n  - All moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The plan covers turns 23 to 28 (6 turns), ensuring both foods are eaten with minimal risk. After turn 28, the snake can focus on survival, but no further food is present.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 23**: Move R (right) to (5,1). This avoids the body and walls, positioning the head closer to (6,1). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 24**: Move R (right) to (6,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 25**: Move U (up) to (6,2). From (6,1), only U is safe (D to wall, L and R to body/wall). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 26**: Move L (left) to (5,2). (5,2) is free, and moving left is allowed (not reverse after U). Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 27**: Move U (up) to (5,3). (5,3) is free, and moving up is allowed (not reverse after L). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 28**: Move U (up) to (5,4) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases). This completes the food collection.\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: R (right)  \nTurn 24: R (right)  \nTurn 25: U (up)  \nTurn 26: L (left)  \nTurn 27: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 24.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, moving to any of these is a wall collision. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), which is a wall cell. So, the snake cannot move to these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). So the snake body is a bit coiled. Head at (5,1), moving right, since head direction is R.\n\nNow, food: two pieces.\n\nFirst food: (6,1) with life span 5 and value 1. So positive food at (6,1), disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so it has 5 turns left including turn 24? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 24, life_span=5 means it has 5 turns left, including this one, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's think carefully.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life_span=N, it means after N turns, it disappears. For example, if N=5 at turn 24, then after 5 turns, at turn 29, it should be gone? But it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 24, countdown is 5, then turn 25, countdown 4, ..., turn 28, countdown 1, turn 29, countdown 0 and disappears. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns from now. So if at turn t, life_span=N, it will disappear at the start of turn t+N or something. But to be precise, let's see the countdown.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if a food has life_span L, then after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after the turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", meaning that during the turn, when we process, the countdown decreases.\n\nI think for planning, I should consider how many turns the food will be available. Since it decreases including current turn, at turn t with life_span L, after this turn, it will have L-1 left for future turns. So for food at (6,1) with life_span 5 at turn 24:\n\n- After turn 24, life_span becomes 4 (available for turn 25)\n\n- After turn 25, life_span 3 (available turn 26)\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 28, life_span 0, disappears before turn 29.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Disappears after turn 28, so not available on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly for the other food: (5,4) with life_span 8, value 1. So positive food, available for 8 turns from now: turns 24 to 31.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,1), direction right. So possible moves: since head is moving right, it can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse rule. Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- R: (6,1) - but (6,1) has food, and also, is (6,1) a wall? Border: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not x=7, so y=1, x=6 should be within bounds. Grid: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,1) is not a wall, since x=6 !=0 or 7, y=1 !=0 or 7. Also, internal obstacles only at (3,6), so (6,1) is fine.\n\nBut (6,1) has food. If snake moves to (6,1), it eats the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nNow, is there any issue? Tail reward danger? But let's see the snake body.\n\nSnake positions: head (5,1), then body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). So tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter moving to (6,1) and eating, snake grows, so new head at (6,1), and tail stays, so positions become: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, but since it moves one step, the head moves to new position, and the tail end adds a new segment, but the existing segments shift.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If it eats food, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move; the snake grows.\n\nBut in terms of positions: after moving without eating, the last segment (tail) is removed, but with eating, no removal, new segment added.\n\nIn this case, if snake moves to (6,1) and eats, the new head is (6,1), the previous head (5,1) becomes neck, and so on, down to the tail (4,3) remains, but since it grows, a new segment is added where the tail was, but the tail position doesn't change immediately? Let's think.\n\nInitial positions: indices: head at index 0: (5,1), then body: (4,1) index 1, (3,1) index 2, (3,2) index 3, (3,3) index 4, (3,4) index 5, (4,4) index 6, (4,3) index 7 (tail).\n\nAfter move right to (6,1): head moves to (6,1), so new position 0: (6,1). Then, the segment that was index 0 moves to where? In snake movement, each segment takes the place of the next one.\n\nBetter to think: the body segments follow. So after head moves to new position, the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, and so on, and if no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo with eat: new positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1) [previous head], (4,1) [previous index 1], (3,1) [previous index 2], (3,2) [previous index 3], (3,3) [previous index 4], (3,4) [previous index 5], (4,4) [previous index 6], and (4,3) [previous tail, now second last], and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nWhen eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail end. So after moving head to (6,1), the body segments from index 1 to 7 shift: index 1 moves to where index 0 was (5,1), index 2 moves to where index 1 was (4,1), and so on, up to index 7 (tail) moves to where index 6 was (4,4), and then a new segment is added at the previous position of the tail, (4,3), so the tail is now at (4,3) but it's a new segment? Positions:\n\nPrevious: index 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3)\n\nAfter move right and eat: head moves to (6,1), so new index 0: (6,1)\n\nThen, index 1 moves to old index 0 position: (5,1)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index 1 position: (4,1)\n\nIndex 3 moves to old index 2 position: (3,1)\n\nIndex 4 moves to old index 3 position: (3,2)\n\nIndex 5 moves to old index 4 position: (3,3)\n\nIndex 6 moves to old index 5 position: (3,4)\n\nIndex 7 moves to old index 6 position: (4,4)\n\nAnd since ate, add new segment at old tail position: (4,3), so new index 8: (4,3)\n\nBut old index 7 was (4,3), which is now where index 7 moved to (4,4), and new tail at (4,3).\n\nNew positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]? Index 7 is (4,4), index 8 is (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) was previously occupied, but now the snake has segments at (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). Is (4,3) a problem? It was part of the body before, but now it's the tail.\n\nFor collision: head at (6,1), which is not colliding with any body because body is at (5,1), (4,1), etc., all different from (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is not in the previous body positions except it was not occupied; previous positions were from (5,1) to (4,3), (6,1) was free, with food.\n\nSo moving to (6,1) should be safe and eat food.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here the tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (6,1). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (6,1) and (4,3) are not adjacent; (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, (4,3) is x=4,y=3, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut the food at (6,1) has life span 5, so it can be eaten now or later.\n\nThere's another food at (5,4) with life span 8.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (5,2)? y+1, so from (5,1) U to (5,2)), D (down to (5,0)? but y=0 is wall, so D to (5,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nL (left to (4,1)) but current direction R, moving L would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nR (right to (6,1)) possible.\n\nU (up to (5,2)) possible.\n\nD (down to (5,0)) invalid, wall.\n\nSo only U or R possible.\n\nR to (6,1): eats food, grows to length 9.\n\nU to (5,2): no food there, so just move, no growth.\n\nNow, after moving, the direction changes.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (6,1) now.\n\nTurn 24: move R to (6,1), eat food, score +1, snake grows to 9 segments.\n\nNew positions: as above, head at (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and new tail at (4,3)? Earlier I said new segments: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) with (4,3) being tail.\n\nNow, from (6,1), head direction was R, but after move, the new direction is whatever we move.\n\nAfter moving R, the head is at (6,1), and we just moved R, so direction is R.\n\nNow possible moves from (6,1):\n\n- U: to (6,2)\n\n- D: to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (5,1) - but (5,1) is now occupied by the body (second segment), so moving there would cause collision, since it's a body cell.\n\n- R: to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,2).\n\nIs that right? (6,1) to U (6,2), which should be free? Current positions after move: cells occupied: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). (6,2) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n\nAlso, walls: no wall at (6,2), since x=6<7, y=2>0.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), not here.\n\nSo yes, from (6,1), only U to (6,2) is possible.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (6,2).\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, collision, L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall.\n\nR to (7,2) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,1) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,2) - is (5,2) occupied? Current positions: after turn 24, snake at (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nAfter move U to (6,2) on turn 25: head moves to (6,2), body shifts: index 1 moves to (6,1)? Positions: new head (6,2), then (6,1) [previous head], (5,1) [previous index 1], (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), and tail (4,3) moves to where? Without eating, tail moves, so since no food, snake doesn't grow, so positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — and (4,3) is removed because no growth.\n\nWhen no eat, the tail is removed. So after move to (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), then body: (6,1) [prev head], (5,1) [prev index1], (4,1) [prev index2], (3,1) [prev index3], (3,2) [prev index4], (3,3) [prev index5], (3,4) [prev index6], (4,4) [prev index7], and the tail (4,3) is gone, so positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — 9 segments? After eating on turn 24, length 9, then turn 25 no eat, so length should be 9, but after move, head new position, body shifts, tail removed, so length decreases? No.\n\nMistake: when snake eats, it grows, so length increases by one. After eating on turn 24, length is 9.\n\nThen on turn 25, if no eat, when it moves, head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated, and no new segment, so length remains the same? No, when no eat, the snake moves, the head goes to new cell, the tail cell is left, so the snake length is the same, but the positions shift.\n\nFor example, from positions S0, S1, S2, ..., Stail.\n\nAfter move to new head position, new positions: new_head, S0, S1, ..., S_{tail-1} — the last position is removed.\n\nSo length decreases only if no eat? No: if no eat, length stays the same; the snake moves forward, so the tail moves, so the number of segments is the same.\n\nInitial length L.\n\nAfter move with no eat: head moves to new position, then each body segment takes the place of the previous one, so the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i>0, and the tail position is left, so the snake occupies L cells, but the tail cell is free now.\n\nThe number of segments remains L.\n\nAfter move with eat: head to new, body segments take previous positions, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so length L+1.\n\nIn this case, turn 24: ate, so length 9.\n\nTurn 25: no eat, so move to (6,2), new head (6,2), then body: (6,1) [was head], (5,1) [was index1], (4,1) [was index2], (3,1) [was index3], (3,2) [was index4], (3,3) [was index5], (3,4) [was index6], (4,4) [was index7], and the previous tail (4,3) is gone, so now positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — that's 9 positions, yes.\n\n(4,4) is the tail.\n\nNow from (6,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,3): free? (6,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nD to (6,1): but (6,1) is now the neck, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (5,2): (5,2) not occupied, as per above positions.\n\nR to (7,2): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U or L.\n\nDirection after move is U, since we moved up.\n\nSo from (6,2), can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nBut L to (5,2) is left, which is not reverse since current direction U, left is perpendicular.\n\nSimilarly, U is same direction.\n\nNow, if we go U to (6,3), or L to (5,2).\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nThis is getting messy. Perhaps eating the food at (6,1) now forces us into a corner.\n\nFrom (6,1), we could only go U to (6,2), then from (6,2) we can go U or L.\n\nIf we go U to (6,3), then head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen from there, U to (6,4), D to (6,2) body, L to (5,3), R wall. So U or L.\n\nSimilarly, it might be tight.\n\nIf from (6,2) we go L to (5,2), then head at (5,2), direction L (since we moved left).\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, L to (4,2), R to (6,2) but (6,2) is now head or something? After moving to (5,2), let's see positions.\n\nTurn 25: after move to (6,2), positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: if move L to (5,2), new head (5,2), body: (6,2) [prev head], (6,1) [prev index1], (5,1) [prev index2], (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) removed? No, with no eat, positions: new head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — and (4,4) is gone, so tail at (3,4).\n\nPositions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — 9 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nNow (5,1) is occupied, so from (5,2), D to (5,1) is occupied, collision.\n\nU to (5,3): free? (5,3) not in positions.\n\nL to (4,2): free? (4,2) not occupied.\n\nR to (6,2): occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nBut this seems messy, and we have another food at (5,4) which we might want to get.\n\nPerhaps eating the food at (6,1) now is not good because it traps us on the right side.\n\nLet's consider not eating it now, and moving up instead.\n\nCurrent turn 24, move U to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction U (since we moved up).\n\nPositions after move: no eat, so new head (5,2), body: (5,1) [prev head], (4,1) [prev index1], (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — and tail (4,3) is removed? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions turn 24: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\nMove U to (5,2), no eat, so new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1) [prev head], (4,1) [prev index1], (3,1) [prev index2], (3,2) [prev index3], (3,3) [prev index4], (3,4) [prev index5], (4,4) [prev index6], and the tail (4,3) is gone, so positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) — 8 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nLength was 8 before, no eat, so still 8.\n\nInitial snake positions: 8 segments, from (5,1) to (4,3).\n\nAfter move U no eat, head to (5,2), body shifts, tail removed, so 8 segments.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,3): free?\n\nD to (5,1): occupied by body, collision\n\nL to (4,2): free?\n\nR to (6,2): free? (6,2) not occupied.\n\nAlso, direction is U, so all moves except reverse, but reverse would be D, which is invalid anyway.\n\nCurrent direction after move is U.\n\nSo can go U, L, or R. Not D (reverse and occupied).\n\nU to (5,3), L to (4,2), R to (6,2) all possible.\n\nNow, there is food at (5,4) and (6,1).\n\n(6,1) has food with life span 5, so available for 5 turns including this, so until turn 28.\n\n(5,4) has life span 8, available longer.\n\nBut (5,4) is above, at y=4.\n\nCurrent head at (5,2), so we can go to (5,3) then (5,4) to eat.\n\nOr other ways.\n\nBut let's think about the board.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is wall.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nSnake body occupies: after move to (5,2), positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nSo occupied cells: (3,1) to (3,4), (4,1), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (6,6) except walls and occupied.\n\nBut we need to plan to eat food.\n\nFood at (6,1) and (5,4).\n\n(6,1) is adjacent to current position? From (5,2), (6,1) is not adjacent; adjacent are (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2). (6,1) is diagonal, not adjacent, so not directly accessible.\n\nTo get to (6,1), we need to go to (6,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied, so only via (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is at (5,4), from (5,2) we can go U to (5,3) then to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) has food, but when we go to (5,4), we eat it, but let's see if there's danger.\n\nAlso, the snake body is at (3,4) and (4,4), so (5,4) is free now.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows.\n\nBut first, let's consider moving U to (5,3) on turn 25 or something.\n\nI need to decide for turn 24.\n\nOption 1: Turn 24 move R to (6,1), eat food, then forced to U to (6,2) on turn 25, then from (6,2) we can go U or L.\n\nIf go U to (6,3), then (6,4), etc., but the grid is small, and we have body below, might trap ourselves.\n\nIf from (6,2) go L to (5,2), then to (5,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) is there, we might be able to get it later.\n\nOption 2: Turn 24 move U to (5,2), then we have more flexibility.\n\nFrom (5,2), we can go to (5,3), then to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nOr go to (6,2), then to (6,1) to eat food there.\n\n(6,1) food has less life span, only 5 turns, so if we don't eat soon, it might disappear.\n\nAt turn 24, life span 5, so available turns 24,25,26,27,28.\n\nIf we don't eat on turn 24, we can eat on turn 25 or later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) has more time.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of collision or dead end.\n\nMoreover, the tail is at (4,4) after moving U.\n\nAfter turn 24 move U to (5,2), positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow, if we move to (5,3) on turn 25, head to (5,3), no food there, so positions shift: head (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) removed, so positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — 8 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, so on turn 26, we can move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,4), eat food, new head (5,4), body: (5,3) [prev head], (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — and since ate, add new segment at previous tail position, which was (3,4), so new tail at (3,4)? Previous positions before move: head at (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nMove to (5,4), eat, so new head (5,4), then body: (5,3) [prev head], (5,2) [prev index1], (5,1) [prev index2], (4,1) [prev index3], (3,1) [prev index4], (3,2) [prev index5], (3,3) [prev index6], (3,4) [prev index7], and new segment at previous tail position (3,4), so new positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is now the tail, but it was occupied, but after adding, it's fine.\n\nHead at (5,4), which is not colliding.\n\nNow, direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is free? In positions, we have (4,1), not (4,4) anymore. Positions are (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free, (5,5) free.\n\nWalls: y=6 is wall, but (5,5) y=5<6, ok.\n\nInternal wall at (3,6), not here.\n\nSo from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n\nD to (5,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo good flexibility.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,1)? It's still there, but we are at (5,4), which is far, and it might disappear soon.\n\nLife span: at turn 24, life span 5, so after turn 24, if not eaten, life span 4 for turn 25, etc.\n\nBut we are at turn 26, head at (5,4), (6,1) is at distance, we might not reach it in time if we eat (5,4) on turn 26.\n\nTurn 26 is when we eat (5,4).\n\n(6,1) available until turn 28.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 26, we can go down or left/right, but to reach (6,1), we need to go to (6,4) or (5,3), but (5,3) is body, so only to (6,4) or (4,4) or (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,1): the shortest path might be through (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) but that's 4 moves, and we are on turn 26, (6,1) available on turn 27 and 28.\n\nTurn 26: head at (5,4), we move, say to (6,4) on turn 26, but turn 26 we are at (5,4) after move, so we can move on turn 27 from (5,4).\n\nTurn 26: after eating (5,4), we are at (5,4) at the end of turn 26.\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,4), we can move to (6,4), for example.\n\nThen head at (6,4), direction R if we moved right.\n\nThen from (6,4), possible U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4) body, R wall invalid.\n\nSo D to (6,3) or U to (6,5).\n\nIf D to (6,3) on turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28: from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 29: from (6,2) to (6,1), but turn 29, (6,1) food would be gone? Life span: at turn 24, life span 5, available turns 24,25,26,27,28. After turn 28, it disappears, so on turn 28, it is still there? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 24, life span 5: available during turn 24.\n\nAfter turn 24, life span 4, available turn 25.\n\nAfter turn 25, life span 3, available turn 26.\n\nAfter turn 26, life span 2, available turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 27, life span 1, available turn 28.\n\nAfter turn 28, life span 0, disappears, not available turn 29.\n\nSo on turn 28, it is still there.\n\nOn turn 29, gone.\n\nSo to eat (6,1), we need to be on (6,1) on turn 28 at latest.\n\nFrom above: turn 26 end: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to (6,4)\n\nTurn 28: move to (6,3)? From (6,4) to (6,3) is D.\n\nThen turn 29: to (6,2), but turn 29 food gone, too late.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 27, we need to go to (6,1) in one move, impossible.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 27, we can move to (6,4) or other.\n\nBut to reach (6,1) by turn 28.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,1): the Manhattan distance is |5-6| + |4-1| = 1+3=4, so at least 4 moves.\n\nTurn 27: move from (5,4) to, say, (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: U (5,5), L (4,4), R (6,4)\n\nNone of which is closer to (6,1).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), then to (6,3), (6,2), (6,1).\n\nSo from (5,4) to (6,4): turn 27\n\nThen to (6,3): turn 28\n\nThen to (6,2): turn 29, but (6,1) not available on turn 29.\n\nOn turn 28, from (6,3) we can move to (6,2), but (6,1) is not reached.\n\nTo eat on turn 28, we need to be at (6,1) on turn 28.\n\nSo from position on turn 27, we need to be adjacent to (6,1) to move to it on turn 28.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,1) are (6,2), (5,1), (6,0) but y=0 wall, (7,1) wall, so only (6,2) and (5,1).\n\nOn turn 27, we need to be at (6,2) or (5,1) to move to (6,1) on turn 28.\n\nBut on turn 26, we are at (5,4), which is far.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 27, we can go to (6,4), (4,4), or (5,5).\n\nNone of which is (6,2) or (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is occupied by body, so inaccessible.\n\n(6,2) might be free, but from (5,4) to (6,2) is not adjacent; we need multiple moves.\n\nSo from (5,4), it takes at least 3 moves to reach (6,2): e.g., to (6,4) then (6,3) then (6,2), but that's turns 27,28,29.\n\nOn turn 29, (6,2) reached, but food gone.\n\nIf we go directly, but not possible.\n\nSo from (5,4), we cannot reach (6,1) in time to eat it before it disappears, since only turns 27 and 28 left after turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to, say, (6,4)\n\nTurn 28: move to (6,3) — not at (6,1)\n\nCannot reach (6,1) on turn 28 from there.\n\nThe only way to eat (6,1) is if we are closer earlier.\n\nIf on turn 24 we move U to (5,2), then on turn 25 we can go to (6,2) for example.\n\nTurn 24: move U to (5,2), positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nTurn 25: from (5,2), we can move R to (6,2), for instance.\n\nThen head to (6,2), no food, positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) removed, so positions: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (3,4)\n\nNow from (6,2), we can move D to (6,1) to eat food on turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: move D to (6,1), eat food.\n\nThen new head (6,1), body: (6,2) [prev head], (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and add new segment at previous tail (3,4), so positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (3,4)\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2) body, collision; D to (6,0) wall; L to (5,1) body, collision; R to (7,1) wall. All invalid except U, but U to (6,2) is occupied, so no move possible, snake dies!\n\nOh! Tail reward danger or just collision.\n\nIn this case, after eating, head at (6,1), and (6,2) is the neck, so moving U would collide, but we don't move yet, but for next move, from (6,1), the only possible move was U, but it's occupied, so indeed, no valid move, game over.\n\nBut in the move to (6,1), we ate food, but then we are trapped.\n\nSpecifically, after moving to (6,1) on turn 26, the head is at (6,1), and the body includes (6,2), which is directly above, so we cannot move up, and other directions are invalid or occupied, so stuck.\n\nThus, eating (6,1) when the cell above or below is occupied can be dangerous.\n\nIn this case, when we move to (6,1) from (6,2), the cell we came from is occupied.\n\nBut in general, if the head moves to a food cell and the only exit is blocked, it can be fatal.\n\nHere, for (6,1), the only exit is up, but after moving down to it, up is now body.\n\nSo we must avoid eating food that leaves us in a dead end.\n\nTherefore, in option 1 where we eat (6,1) on turn 24, we were forced to go up to (6,2), then we could go left or up, but not directly trapped, but it might be risky.\n\nIn turn 24 eat (6,1), then turn 25 must go U to (6,2), then from (6,2) we can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf go L to (5,2), then as before, we can move around.\n\nBut from (6,2) to (5,2), then head at (5,2), and so on.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) is available.\n\nBut let's not go that route.\n\nBack to turn 24 decision.\n\nIf we move U to (5,2) on turn 24, then we can go to (5,3) on turn 25, then to (5,4) on turn 26 to eat that food, as I had earlier, and that seems safe, with flexibility after.\n\nAnd we avoid the risky (6,1) food.\n\nSince (6,1) is hard to get without trapping, and it has short life, we might skip it.\n\nAlso, negative food not present, all food here is positive.\n\nBut the internal obstacle at (3,6) might block some paths, but not directly relevant now.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body has a loop, but after moving, it might clear.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nIf we eat (5,4) on turn 26, we have a longer snake, and we can explore the board.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4), head at (5,4), we can go to (5,5), then (5,6) but y=6 is wall? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, but (5,6) is within bounds.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 y=0,7 walls.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so (5,6) is free.\n\nFrom (5,4) after eating, go U to (5,5), then to (5,6), then must turn, etc.\n\nBut we can survive longer.\n\nWhereas if we go for (6,1), we might die soon.\n\nSo probably better to move U on turn 24.\n\nThen we can plan to eat (5,4) soon.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions starting from turn t1, for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., as many as I decide, but probably at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=24.\n\nSo I should output turns 24 to, say, 28 or 29.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 24: move U to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 25: from (5,2), we can move U to (5,3) to approach the food at (5,4)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nAfter that, we need to move away.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4), after eating, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nNow, to avoid staying, we can go R to (6,4), for example.\n\nThen turn 28: from (6,4), can go U to (6,5), D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify too far, but for 5 turns ahead, up to turn 29.\n\nSince we think ahead, but output actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output turns 24 to 28.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 25, moving to (5,3) is safe.\n\nThen turn 26 eat (5,4).\n\nBut when we move to (5,4), is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (3,4) after the move, which is not adjacent to (5,4). Adjacent would be (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4). (5,3) is body, but we move to (5,4), and tail at (3,4) is far, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, as before.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 24: U (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 25: U (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 26: U (to (5,4) and eat)\n\nThen for turn 27, from (5,4), we need to move, say R to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 28: from (6,4), we can move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3), but to keep it simple, say U to (6,5)\n\nBut we don't have to specify all, but since it says \"action on turn t1 +1\" etc., I think we need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turns 24,25,26,27,28.\n\nBut turn 28 might be too far, but we can plan.\n\nSince the grid is small, we can think of a path.\n\nAfter turn 26, head at (5,4), positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (6,4)\n\nNo food, so positions: new head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and tail (3,4) removed, so positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 28: from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4) body, R wall.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nSay U to (6,5)\n\nThen head to (6,5), direction U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 28.\n\nNow, about the other food (6,1), we decided not to go for it because of the risk and short life.\n\nIf we don't eat it, it disappears after turn 28, no penalty.\n\nSo better to avoid risk.\n\nTherefore, for turn 24, move U.\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the internal obstacle (3,6), it might affect later, but not immediately.\n\nSo I think moving U is better.\n\nThen to confirm, on turn 24, moving U to (5,2) is safe.\n\nThen turn 25 move U to (5,3) safe.\n\nTurn 26 move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 27, move R to (6,4) safe.\n\nTurn 28, move U to (6,5) safe.\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can include one more turn.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify how many, but at least from t1 to t1+4 or something, 5 actions.\n\nt1=24, so turns 24 to 28 is 5 turns.\n\nActions: 24,25,26,27,28.\n\nNow, for turn 27, moving R to (6,4) is fine.\n\nTurn 28, U to (6,5) is fine.\n\nTo be more strategic, but I think it's ok.\n\nSince we think ahead, but output only the actions.\n\nSo decision: on turn 24, move U.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 24 to 28). The key considerations are:\n- **Food at (6,1)**: Short lifespan (disappears after turn 28) and risky to eat due to potential dead-end after consumption. Eating it now could trap the snake against the wall or body.\n- **Food at (5,4)**: Longer lifespan (disappears after turn 31), safer to reach, and eating it provides growth without immediate risk.\n- **Snake body and movement constraints**: The snake is currently coiled, with the head at (5,1) moving right. Moving up (U) on turn 24 avoids the risky (6,1) food and positions the snake to safely reach (5,4) by turn 26.\n- **Survival focus**: After eating (5,4), the snake moves right to (6,4) and then up to (6,5) to explore open space, avoiding collisions and maintaining flexibility.\n\n### Planned Turn-by-Turn Actions\n- **Turn 24**: Move U (up) to (5,2). This avoids the risky (6,1) food, prevents potential trapping, and starts the path toward (5,4). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 25**: Move U (up) to (5,3). Continues toward (5,4) safely. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 26**: Move U (up) to (5,4). Eats the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). Position is safe—tail is at (3,4), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n- **Turn 27**: Move R (right) to (6,4). Moves away from the eaten food and into open space. No food here, so no growth.\n- **Turn 28**: Move U (up) to (6,5). Explores the upper-right area, avoiding walls and body. No food here, so no growth.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Turn 24 (U)**: Moving right (R) to (6,1) eats the food but forces an immediate move to (6,2) on turn 25, risking a dead-end if not managed carefully. Moving up (U) is safer and aligns with the goal of reaching (5,4).\n- **Turns 25-26 (U, U)**: Directly targets (5,4) with minimal risk. The path is clear, and eating on turn 26 avoids the short-lived (6,1) food.\n- **Turns 27-28 (R, U)**: After eating, moving right and up opens up the board for future moves, with no immediate threats. The snake can continue exploring safely beyond turn 28.\n- **5+ turn lookahead**: This sequence ensures survival beyond turn 28 by avoiding the (6,1) trap and leveraging the safer (5,4) food. Future moves (e.g., from (6,5)) can access more space, like moving left or up, to find new food and avoid obstacles.\n\nThis plan safely scores +1 from the (5,4) food while setting up for sustained survival. The (6,1) food is ignored due to its risk and short lifespan.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: R\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 25, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given: head at (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,2) from below, so previous position was (5,1), but since it's moving Up, from (5,1) to (5,2), so current head is at (5,2) facing Up.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]. Head is first, so (5,2) is head. Direction is U, so it came from (5,1) to (5,2).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (6,1) with life span 4, value +1\n\n- (5,4) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (1,3) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so all are good to eat, but I need to consider the life span; they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn. So for (6,1), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns, including turn 25? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor food at (6,1): life span 4 at turn 25. So it can be eaten on turns 25, 26, 27, 28. Disappears at turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): life span 7 at turn 25, so available from turn 25 to 31, gone at 32.\n\n(1,3): life span 10, available from 25 to 34, gone at 35.\n\nI need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,2)\n\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is U (Up), so I cannot move Down instantly, because no instant reverse. So Down is not allowed next move.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R (since D is opposite and not allowed).\n\nNow, let's see what each move would do.\n\nFirst, if I move Up: from (5,2) to (5,3)\n\nThen the snake would be: head at (5,3), then the body: since it moves, the tail will move away from (4,4)? When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail is removed.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,3): is there food? Food is at (6,1), (5,4), (1,3). (5,3) has no food listed, so no food eaten. So new head at (5,3), body: the previous head (5,2) becomes part of body, and so on, up to (4,4), but since no growth, the tail (4,4) is removed, and the new tail would be (3,4)? Let's list the positions after move.\n\nCurrent positions: indices 0:head (5,2), 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7:tail (4,4)\n\nAfter moving Up to (5,3):\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nThen the body: (5,2) becomes segment 1, (5,1) becomes seg 2, (4,1) seg 3, (3,1) seg 4, (3,2) seg 5, (3,3) seg 6, (3,4) seg 7, and tail was (4,4), but since no food, tail is removed, so (3,4) is the new tail? Positions: new head (5,3), then the first 7 segments of the old body, but since tail is removed, we take positions 0 to 6 of old as new 1 to 7, and new head is new 0.\n\nOld positions: [0:(5,2), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(3,2), 5:(3,3), 6:(3,4), 7:(4,4)]\n\nAfter move, no food eaten: new positions: head at (5,3), then body: old [0] to [6]: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Old [7] is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] and tail is (3,4).\n\nOld tail (4,4) is gone, and (3,4) is now the tail.\n\nNow, is this position safe? (5,3) is not a wall, and not colliding with body? Body positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (5,3) is not in this list, so no collision. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle (3,6), so (5,3) is within bounds, not wall. So safe.\n\nBut (5,3) is empty now? No food there.\n\nNow, similarly, if I move Left: from (5,2) to (4,2)\n\nThen new head (4,2), body: old [0] to [6]: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Old tail (4,4) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nTail is (3,4).\n\nIs (4,2) safe? Not a wall, not in body positions except the head is moving there, but body positions are the old ones, which are (5,2), etc., (4,2) is not in old body, so safe.\n\nNow, if I move Right: from (5,2) to (6,2)\n\n(6,2): is it wall? Borders x=0 and x=7, so x=7 is wall, x=6 is not wall? x from 0 to 7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly for y.\n\nx=6 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. But internal obstacles: only (3,6), so (6,2) should be free.\n\nBut is there food? (6,1) is food, but (6,2) is not.\n\nSo moving Right to (6,2): new head (6,2), body: old [0] to [6]: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail (4,4) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nTail (3,4).\n\nNow, (6,2) safe? Yes.\n\nBut I cannot move Down, because it's opposite to current Up direction.\n\nNow, I need to think about food. There is food at (6,1), which is below (6,2), but since I'm at (5,2), if I move Right to (6,2), then I'm adjacent to (6,1). But (6,1) is food, and I could move Down to it next turn.\n\nBut let's think longer term.\n\nFirst, I should consider the food locations and their life spans.\n\n(6,1) life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 28 (since disappears at 29, last chance turn 28).\n\nTurn 25: life span 4, so available turn 25,26,27,28; gone turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 7, available 25 to 31.\n\n(1,3) life span 10, available 25 to 34.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,2). Food at (6,1) is at distance: |6-5| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, so I can reach it in 2 moves: e.g., Right to (6,2), then Down to (6,1).\n\nBut when I move Down to (6,1), I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, after moving Right to (6,2), direction would be R, so then I can move Down, since not opposite to R? Current direction after move: if I move Right from Up, new direction is R, so Down is not opposite to R? Opposites: U-D, L-R.\n\nDown is not opposite to Right, so I can move Down.\n\nBut when I move to (6,1), I eat the food, so snake grows, no tail removal.\n\nBut need to check for collisions.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when moving to (6,1), the tail is not at (6,1), so no issue.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 25: move Right to (6,2)\n\nNew snake: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)  [tail (3,4)]\n\nNo food at (6,2), so no growth.\n\nTurn 26: from (6,2), direction R (since moved right), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Cannot move Left, opposite to R.\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nFood at (6,1) is directly below, so move Down to (6,1).\n\nNow, (6,1) is food, so eat it, snake grows: head moves to (6,1), and tail not removed.\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nBody: the previous positions, so old head (6,2) becomes body, then old body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) and since ate food, tail stays, so all segments kept, new tail is (3,4) still? Old positions: after turn 25, snake is [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] with 8 segments? Let's count: positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(5,2), 2:(5,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(3,1), 5:(3,2), 6:(3,3), 7:(3,4)\n\nAfter eating food at (6,1): head to (6,1), and the body is all the previous segments, so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) and tail is (3,4), but (3,4) is still there, so snake grows to 9 segments.\n\nNew segments: [ (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) is the tail, and head is at (6,1), no collision.\n\nNow, walls: (6,1) is x=6, y=1, not border, since x=0,7 walls, y=0,7 walls, so y=1 is not wall, ok.\n\nSo eating (6,1) on turn 26 is possible and safe.\n\nBut life span is 4, so if I don't eat on turn 25 or 26, I can still eat later, but let's see.\n\nAnother food at (5,4), which is above.\n\nFrom (5,2), if I move Up to (5,3), then I'm closer to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), head at (5,2), so |5-5| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2, also 2 moves away.\n\nMove Up to (5,3), then Up to (5,4).\n\nIf I move to (5,4) and eat it.\n\nBut (5,4) has food, so eating it would grow.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nAlso, there's the obstacle at (3,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nNow, the third food at (1,3), which is far left, |1-5| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5, so about 5 moves away.\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about the map and snake body.\n\nCurrent snake body occupies many cells, especially around (3,1) to (3,4) and (4,1), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2).\n\nThe area near (5,2) has body below and left, but above is free, right is free.\n\nNow, after eating (6,1), the snake is longer, and tail is at (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should not rush to eat (6,1) immediately because it has longer life, but life span 4 is short, only 4 turns to eat, while others have more.\n\n(6,1) must be eaten by turn 28, (5,4) by 31, (1,3) by 34.\n\nSince (6,1) is close and time-sensitive, I should go for it soon.\n\nBut let's see what happens if I don't go for it now.\n\nFor example, if I move Up to (5,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen new head (5,3), body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is tail, and head at (5,3), no food eaten.\n\nThen turn 26, from (5,3), direction U (since moved up), can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nFood at (5,4) is above, so I can move Up to (5,4).\n\nEat food: head to (5,4), grow, new snake: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nNow, (3,4) is tail, but head at (5,4), no collision.\n\nBut the body includes (5,3), (5,2), etc.\n\nNow, after eating (5,4), I have time for (6,1) or (1,3).\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), I'm at (5,4), distance |6-5| + |1-4| =1 +3=4, so 4 moves away.\n\nBut life span of (6,1) is only 4 at turn 25, so at turn 26, life span decreases to 3, available until turn 28.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) on turn 26, it's turn 27.\n\nFrom (5,4), I need to go to (6,1).\n\nPossible path: move Right to (6,4), then Down to (6,3), Down to (6,2), Down to (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) must be eaten by turn 28, so on turn 27 or 28.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4), if I move Right to (6,4), eat? (6,4) has no food, so no.\n\nThen turn 28: from (6,4), move Down to (6,3), no food.\n\nTurn 29: move Down to (6,2), no food? (6,1) is food, but at turn 29, (6,1) is gone, since life span 4 at turn 25, gone at turn 29.\n\nTurn 25: life span 4, so available turn 25,26,27,28; gone turn 29.\n\nAfter turn 26, I'm at (5,4), turn 27 I can move to (6,4), but (6,4) not food.\n\nThen turn 28, I need to be at (6,1) to eat it.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 27, to (6,1) in one move? No, I can only move one cell, so to (6,3) or (5,4) or (6,5) or (7,4) but x=7 wall, so not possible.\n\n(6,4) to (6,1) is three steps down, but I can move down multiple times.\n\nTurn 27: at (6,4), move Down to (6,3)\n\nTurn 28: at (6,3), move Down to (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) is not (6,1), so I need to move Down again to (6,1) on turn 29, but turn 29 it's gone, too late.\n\nOn turn 28, if I move to (6,2), I can move Down to (6,1) on turn 28? Turn 28 move to (6,2), then turn 29 move to (6,1), but turn 29 (6,1) is gone.\n\n(6,1) must be eaten on or before turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, if I am at (6,2) and move Down to (6,1), that would be turn 28, so I can eat it on turn 28.\n\nBut on turn 27, I need to be at a position adjacent to (6,1).\n\nFrom turn 26 position: after eating (5,4) on turn 26, I'm at (5,4) with direction U or something.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) and eating, direction is U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 27, from (5,4), I can move Right to (6,4) (since not opposite).\n\nThen at (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 28, from (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3)? But (6,3) is not (6,1), I need to go to (6,1) directly? No, I have to move step by step.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3) on turn 28, but (6,3) is not food, and (6,1) is not eaten yet.\n\nThen on turn 29, I move to (6,2) or something, but (6,1) gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be at (6,1) or adjacent and move to it.\n\nOn turn 27, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,1), like (6,2), (5,1), (7,1) but x=7 wall, or (6,0) but y=0 wall, so only (6,2) or (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is occupied by body? Let's see.\n\nOn turn 26, after eating (5,4), snake is at: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo (5,1) is occupied, body segment.\n\n(6,2) is free, I think.\n\nGrid: let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7, but since cells, only the perimeter.\n\nAnd internal obstacle (3,6).\n\nNow, snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo occupied: x=5 y=1,2,3,4; x=4 y=1; x=3 y=1,2,3,4\n\nFree cells: for example, (6,1) is food, (6,2) should be free, (6,3) free, (6,4) free, etc.\n\nOn turn 27, from (5,4), I can move to (6,4), which is free.\n\nThen on turn 28, from (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3), but (6,3) is not (6,1), and I need to be at (6,1) to eat, but I'm at (6,3), which is two away, cannot reach in one move.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 28, I can move Down to (6,3), but that's not helpful.\n\nI can move directly to a cell adjacent to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,0) but y=0 wall, (5,1), (7,1) x=7 wall.\n\nSo only (6,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is occupied by snake body, as above.\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nSo on turn 28, if I am at (6,2), I can move Down to (6,1) to eat it.\n\nBut to be at (6,2) on turn 28, on turn 27 I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,2), like (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n\n(6,1) is the food, but if I move to it, I eat it earlier.\n\n(5,2) is occupied by snake body on turn 26, but after moves.\n\nLet's think from turn 26 position.\n\nAfter turn 26, snake at (5,4) head, with body down to (3,4).\n\nTurn 27: I can move from (5,4) to (6,4), arriving at (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (6,4), not adjacent to (6,2) or (6,1) directly.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3) on turn 28.\n\nThen at (6,3), I can move Down to (6,2) on turn 29, but turn 29 (6,1) is gone.\n\nOn turn 28, from (6,4), I can only move to (6,3), (6,5) but y=5? y=7 wall, y=5 is ok, or (5,4) back, or (7,4) wall.\n\nBut (6,3) is not adjacent to (6,1); (6,1) is two down.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,1) on turn 28 from (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nIf on turn 27, from (5,4), instead of moving Right, I move Down to (5,3), but (5,3) is body segment, collision! On turn 26, after eating (5,4), (5,3) is the second segment, so moving to (5,3) would collide with body, die.\n\nSimilarly, move Left to (4,4), is (4,4) free? On turn 26, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(4,4) is not in the list, so should be free? (4,4) was tail earlier, but after growth, it's not there.\n\nIn turn 26 snake, (4,4) is not occupied, so free.\n\nMove Left to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nBut (4,4) is not near (6,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), it's farther.\n\nSo to eat (6,1) on turn 28, I need to be at (6,2) or (5,1) on turn 28, but (5,1) is occupied, so only (6,2).\n\nTo be at (6,2) on turn 28, on turn 27 I need to be at (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), or (7,2) wall.\n\n(6,1) is food, if I move to it on turn 27, I eat it then.\n\n(5,2) is occupied on turn 26.\n\nOn turn 27, from where?\n\nAfter turn 26, at (5,4), on turn 27 I move to (6,4) or other.\n\nBut (6,3) is free, but to reach (6,3) on turn 27, I need to move to it from (5,4) or (6,4), but from (5,4), I can move to (5,3) but body, or (5,5), or (4,4), or (6,4).\n\nNone of these is (6,3). (6,3) is adjacent to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, or (6,4), or (6,2), or (7,3) wall.\n\nSo from (5,4), I cannot move directly to (6,3); not adjacent.\n\n(5,4) to (6,3) is diagonal, not allowed; only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo I can only move to (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is body, occupied; (5,5) might be free, (4,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\nBut none is (6,3).\n\nSo on turn 27, I cannot be at (6,3) from turn 26 position.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (5,4) on turn 26, I cannot reach (6,1) by turn 28; the earliest I can be at (6,1) is turn 29, but it's gone.\n\nThus, if I go for (5,4) first, I miss (6,1).\n\nTherefore, I should go for (6,1) first, since it's time-sensitive.\n\nSimilarly, if I do nothing on turn 25, it might be worse.\n\nAnother option: on turn 25, move to (6,2) as I thought earlier.\n\nThen turn 26 move to (6,1) and eat it.\n\nThen I have (5,4) and (1,3) to eat.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), I'm at (6,1) after eating.\n\n|6-5| + |1-4| =1+3=4 moves away.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 25, so after turn 25, on turn 26, life span 6, available until turn 31.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\n(1,3) life span 10, more time.\n\nSo after eating (6,1), I can go to (5,4).\n\nFrom (6,1), direction after moving down: when I move to (6,1) from (6,2), I moved down, so direction D.\n\nThen from (6,1), I can move U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n\nTo go to (5,4), I need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, move Left to (5,1), but (5,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating (6,1) on turn 26, snake positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(5,1) is body segment, so I cannot move to (5,1), collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,0) is wall, (7,1) wall, so from (6,1), possible moves: Up to (6,2) but (6,2) is body segment, collision; Left to (5,1) body, collision; Right to (7,1) wall; Down to (6,0) wall.\n\nOh! After eating (6,1) on turn 26, from (6,1), all adjacent cells are blocked: Up to (6,2) body, Left to (5,1) body, Right wall, Down wall. So I'm trapped and die on next move!\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nAfter turn 25: move Right to (6,2), snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] 8 segments, tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 26: move Down to (6,1), eat food, grow: new snake [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] 9 segments.\n\nNow, head at (6,1). Adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,2) - occupied by body (second segment)\n\n- Down: (6,0) - y=0, wall\n\n- Left: (5,1) - occupied by body (fourth segment? Positions: 0: (6,1), 1: (6,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), ... so (5,1) is index 3, body segment)\n\n- Right: (7,1) - x=7, wall\n\nSo all four directions are blocked: body or wall. Therefore, on turn 27, no matter where I move, I die.\n\nThus, going directly to eat (6,1) on turn 26 leads to death.\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (6,1) immediately because it would trap me.\n\nI need to clear some space first or approach differently.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat it yet, or eat other food to move the tail.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,1) can be eaten later, but I need to be able to reach it safely.\n\nCurrently, with the snake body, (6,1) is surrounded: left (5,1) body, above (6,2) is free now, but after moving, etc.\n\nAt turn 25, positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n\n(6,1) is food, adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,0) wall, (5,1), (7,1) wall.\n\n(5,1) is body, occupied.\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nSo to eat (6,1), I need to move to it from (6,2) or from other, but only (6,2) is available.\n\nBut after eating, as above, I get trapped.\n\nSo I need to have an escape route.\n\nPerhaps I should move the snake to free up (5,1) or something.\n\nFor example, if I move Up to (5,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen snake: head (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(5,1) is still body.\n\nThen turn 26, from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) to eat the food there.\n\nMove Up to (5,4), eat, grow: new head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nNow, at (5,4), direction U.\n\nAdjacent cells: Up (5,5), Down (5,3) body, Left (4,4), Right (6,4)\n\n(5,3) is body, so Down not possible.\n\nUp to (5,5), if free; Left to (4,4), free; Right to (6,4), free.\n\nSo I can move, for example, Right to (6,4) or Left to (4,4).\n\nNow, (6,1) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nBut to eat (6,1), I need to go down.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move Right to (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen move Down to (6,3) on turn 28, but (6,3) not food, and (6,1) to eat.\n\nOn turn 28, from (6,4) to (6,3), then turn 29 to (6,2), but (6,1) gone on turn 29.\n\nLife span: at turn 25, life span 4, so turn 28 is last chance.\n\nOn turn 28, I need to be at (6,1).\n\nOn turn 27, I am at (6,4), not adjacent to (6,1).\n\nOn turn 28, from (6,4), I can move to (6,3), not (6,1).\n\nSo cannot eat (6,1) if I go for (5,4) first.\n\nBut earlier, if I go directly for (6,1), I die after eating.\n\nSo I need a way to eat (6,1) without dying.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (6,1) at all, but it's +1 score, and I should maximize, but survival first.\n\nLife span 4, so if I don't eat it, it disappears, no penalty, but missed opportunity.\n\nBut there are other foods.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can move in a way that when I eat (6,1), the body is not blocking.\n\nFor example, if I move Left or something to shift the body.\n\nCurrent position: head (5,2), direction U.\n\nIf I move Left to (4,2) on turn 25.\n\nThen new head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nNow, at (4,2), direction L (since moved left from U? Previous direction U, moved Left, so new direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L (not R, opposite).\n\nNow, food at (6,1) still, but I'm at (4,2), farther.\n\nBut I can move to free space.\n\nFor example, move Up to (4,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen at (4,3), direction U if moved up.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4), but (4,4) was tail, but now free? After turn 25, tail removed, so (4,4) free.\n\nMove to (4,4) on turn 27, etc.\n\nBut (6,1) will disappear soon.\n\nPerhaps I should ignore (6,1) and go for (5,4) or (1,3).\n\n(5,4) is closer.\n\nFrom (5,2), move Up to (5,3) on turn 25.\n\nThen on turn 26, move Up to (5,4) and eat it.\n\nThen as before, at (5,4), I can move Right to (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move Down to (6,3) on turn 28, Down to (6,2) on turn 29, etc.\n\nBut (6,1) gone.\n\nThen I can go for (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), life span 10, so available until turn 34.\n\nFrom (6,4) or wherever, I can head left.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), snake at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nThe area around (3,3) to (3,4) and (4,4) is free, but (4,4) is free.\n\nI can move Left from (5,4) to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen I can move Up to (4,5) or Down to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,3), I need to go left.\n\nBut there's the obstacle at (3,6), but not in the way yet.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nBut let's think about Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThere's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail currently.\n\nTail is at (3,4), no food there.\n\nFood is at (6,1), (5,4), (1,3), none on tail.\n\nSo not an issue now.\n\nBack to the trap problem.\n\nTo eat (6,1) safely, I need to have an exit after eating.\n\nFor example, if (5,1) is not occupied when I eat (6,1), then I could move Left to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is currently occupied, so I need to move the snake so that (5,1) is free when I eat.\n\nFor instance, if I move the snake such that the tail moves away.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4), but after moves, it changes.\n\nLet's simulate moving Left first.\n\nTurn 25: move Left to (4,2)\n\nNew snake: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)  tail (3,4) since no growth.\n\nOld tail (4,4) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (4,2), then old head (5,2), then old body 1 to 6: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)  so 8 segments, tail (3,4)\n\nOld positions: 0:(5,2), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(3,2), 5:(3,3), 6:(3,4), 7:(4,4)\n\nAfter move Left to (4,2), no food, so new positions: head (4,2), then old 0 to 6: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)  and old 7 removed, so tail (3,4)\n\nNow, at (4,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 26: I can move, say, Up to (4,3)\n\nNew head (4,3), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail (3,3) since tail removed? Old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then old head (4,2), then old body 1 to 6: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)  and old 6 (3,4) removed, so new tail (3,3)\n\n(3,4) was removed.\n\nNow, (5,1) is still body.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3), I can move Up to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is free, no food, so move to (4,4), new head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut (6,1) life span decreasing, and I'm not closer.\n\nBy turn 28, I might not be able to reach it.\n\nFor example, on turn 28, I could be at (4,4), then to (6,1) is far.\n\nSo likely, I will miss (6,1).\n\nSince (6,1) is hard to eat safely, and time-sensitive, perhaps I should abandon it and focus on other food.\n\nBut let's check if there's a way.\n\nAnother move: on turn 25, move Right to (6,2), but not eat Down yet.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2) on turn 25, snake: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] tail (3,4)\n\nAt (6,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 26, instead of moving Down, I can move Up to (6,3) or Right to (7,2) wall, or Left to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision, or Down to (6,1) but we saw it causes trap.\n\nSo move Up to (6,3).\n\nThen new head (6,3), no food, so body (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail (3,3) since (3,4) removed.\n\nNow, at (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 27, I can move to (6,4) or Left to (5,3) or Right wall, or Down to (6,2) body.\n\n(6,2) is body, so Down not good.\n\nMove to (6,4) or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nCurrent positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(5,3) not in list, free.\n\nMove Left to (5,3) on turn 27.\n\nThen new head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nNo food.\n\nThen turn 28, from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) to eat the food there.\n\nMove Up to (5,4), eat, grow: new head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nNow, at (5,4), direction U.\n\nAdjacent cells: Up (5,5), Down (5,3) body, Left (4,4), Right (6,4)\n\n(5,3) body, so Down not possible.\n\nCan move Up, Left, Right.\n\nBut (6,1) is gone on turn 29, and I'm at (5,4), not able to eat it.\n\nSo still missed.\n\nTherefore, it seems difficult to eat (6,1) without trapping myself or missing it due to time.\n\nPerhaps the best is to ignore (6,1) and go for the other foods.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which I can eat easily from (5,2) by moving Up twice.\n\nThen (1,3) is far, but I can go there.\n\nAlso, there might be space on the left.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), snake is at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nFree cells: for example, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,1), (2,2), etc., and (6,4), (6,3), etc.\n\nI can move to (4,4) or (6,4), then explore.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, on turn 25, move Up to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 26, move Up to (5,4) and eat.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (5,4), I can move Left to (4,4) (since (4,4) is free)\n\nDirection after moving to (5,4) is U, so moving Left is allowed.\n\nMove to (4,4), no food, so new head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (3,3) since no growth, old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then old head (5,4), old body 1 to 7: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)  and old tail (3,4) removed, so new tail (3,3)\n\nNow, at (4,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 28, from (4,4), I can move Up to (4,5), or Down to (4,3), or Left to (3,4), or Right to (5,4) body.\n\n(5,4) is body, so not.\n\n(3,4) is free? Positions: (3,4) was removed, so free.\n\nMove to (3,4) on turn 28.\n\nThen and so on.\n\nThen I can head towards (1,3).\n\nFor example, move Left to (3,4) on turn 28.\n\nFrom (4,4) move Left to (3,4).\n\nNew head (3,4), no food, body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4), move Down to (3,3) but (3,3) might be body or not; in this case, (3,3) is body, so collision.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n(3,3) not in list, so free? (3,3) was tail before, but removed.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nSo (3,3) is free.\n\nMove Down to (3,3) on turn 29.\n\nThen to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so not.\n\nFrom (3,4), can move Down to (3,3), or Left to (2,4), or Up to (3,5), or Right to (4,4) body.\n\nSo move to (3,3) or (2,4) or (3,5).\n\nThen to reach (1,3), I can go left.\n\nBut let's not detail all.\n\nSince I need to output moves for several turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and output actions for the current and next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for a few turns.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 25.\n\nLet's decide on a sequence.\n\nGiven the risk with (6,1), I think it's better to avoid it and go for (5,4) and then to (1,3).\n\nSo on turn 25: move Up to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 26: move Up to (5,4) and eat\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,4), move Left to (4,4)  (since (4,4) is free)\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,4), I can move Up to (4,5) or Left to (3,4) or Down to (4,3), etc.\n\nTo head towards (1,3), I should go left.\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3, I'm at (4,4), so move Left to (3,4)\n\nOn turn 28, move Left to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4), move Left to (2,4) or Down to (3,3), etc.\n\n(1,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down as well.\n\nBut there's time, life span 10, so at turn 25, 10 turns left.\n\nAfter turn 28, it's turn 29, life span decreases to 7 or something, still time.\n\nBut let's output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) will be eaten on turn 26.\n\nBut in the state, food at (5,4) is there, and I can eat it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nBut I also need to consider the long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), the snake is longer, and I need to navigate to open space.\n\nThe grid has internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block, but not immediately.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nSince (6,1) will disappear, I can ignore it.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nTurn 25: move U\n\nTurn 26: move U (to eat (5,4))\n\nThen turn 27: move L to (4,4)\n\nNow, at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) or D to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) might be free, but let's see the body.\n\nAfter turn 27, after moving to (4,4), snake positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\n(4,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) free, (4,5) free.\n\nTo go to (1,3), moving to (3,4) then (2,4), etc., but (1,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving Down to (4,3) might be better to lower y.\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, same as (1,3).\n\nMove D to (4,3) on turn 28.\n\nThen at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen move L to (3,3), but (3,3) is tail? On turn 28, after moving to (4,3), let's simulate.\n\nTurn 27: at (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\nNo food, so new head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2) since (3,3) removed? Old tail (3,3) removed.\n\nPositions after turn 27: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nMove Down to (4,3), no food, so new head (4,3), then body: old head (4,4), old body 1 to 7: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)  and old tail (3,3) removed, so new tail (3,2)\n\nNow, at (4,3), direction D.\n\nAdjacent cells: Up (4,4) body, Down (4,2), Left (3,3) free? (3,3) was removed, free, Right (5,3) body.\n\n(5,3) is body.\n\nSo can move Down to (4,2) or Left to (3,3).\n\n(4,2) might be free.\n\nMove to (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can list the first few moves.\n\nSince the instruction is to prioritize long-term survival, and eating (6,1) is risky, I'll avoid it.\n\nSo for turn 25: move U\n\nThen turn 26: move U to eat (5,4)\n\nThen for turn 27, I need to choose a safe move.\n\nFrom (5,4), after eating, direction U, I can move L to (4,4) or R to (6,4) or U to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is free, (6,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nMoving L to (4,4) is fine.\n\nThen turn 28 from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4) or D to (4,3)\n\nTo explore, say move U to (4,5)\n\nBut (1,3) is at y=3, so moving up might not be efficient, but survival first, I can go up and then left.\n\nSince the grid is small, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area near (3,6) obstacle might be tricky.\n\nBut (3,6) is at y=6, not in the way yet.\n\nPerhaps for the first 5 turns, I can do:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U (eat (5,4))\n\nTurn 27: L ( to (4,4) )\n\nTurn 28: U ( to (4,5) )\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) or L to (3,5) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is y=6, not wall, but obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is free.\n\nI can move to (4,6) if I want.\n\nBut let's not specify too far.\n\nSince the food (1,3) is there, I should start heading left.\n\nSo on turn 28, from (4,4), move L to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 29 from (3,4), move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be body or free.\n\nAfter turn 27, at (4,4), move L to (3,4) on turn 28.\n\nThen new head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4), move L to (2,4) (free), or D to (3,3) (free), etc.\n\nThen to (1,3), from (2,4) move D to (2,3), then L to (1,3).\n\nOr from (3,3) move L to (2,3), then L to (1,3).\n\nBut I think it's feasible.\n\nFor the answer, I can output the first few moves.\n\nBut the user might expect the actions for the current and next turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is for turns t1, t1+1, etc., probably for a few turns.\n\nI think for turn 25 to 29 or so.\n\nBut let's finalize.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat all food, but (6,1) is too risky, so skip.\n\nSo for turn 25: move U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,4) eat food\n\nThen for turn 27, I need to move from (5,4).\n\nLet's choose to move Left to (4,4) for exploration.\n\nThen turn 28, move Left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 29, move Down to (3,3) or Left to (2,4), say Down to (3,3) to lower y.\n\nBut (3,3) might be occupied later, but not now.\n\nAt turn 27 after move to (4,4), positions include (3,3) as tail or something, but let's not complicate.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L  ( to (3,4) )\n\nTurn 29: D  ( to (3,3) )\n\nThen from there to (1,3).\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 29 or 30.\n\nSince the food (1,3) is far, I don't need to specify all.\n\nBut in the box, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 25 to 29.\n\nBut turn 29 is t1+4.\n\nt1=25, so turn 25,26,27,28,29.\n\n5 turns.\n\nOk.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nBut on turn 28 moving to (3,4), and turn 29 to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nTo make it smoother, from (4,4) on turn 28, move to (4,3) instead, but earlier I thought of that.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer to y=3.\n\nOn turn 27: at (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 28 at (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 29 at (3,3), move L to (3,2) but (3,2) might be body? After turn 28: after move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nSo (3,2) is tail, so moving to (3,2) on turn 29 would be collision, since it's body.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move to (3,2), it's occupied.\n\nSo better to move to (2,3) or something.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 28, move L to (3,3)\n\nThen at (3,3), direction L or D? After moving to (3,3) from (4,3), moved left, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,3), can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) body, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) body.\n\nSo move L to (2,3) or U to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, so move L to (2,3).\n\nThen to (1,3) next.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll go with the first plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 29: L (to (2,4)) or D, but I said D earlier, but let's say L to (2,4)\n\nTo be consistent, let's output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (6,1) has a short life span (must be eaten by turn 28) but is risky to eat immediately due to potential trapping. The food at (5,4) is safe and can be eaten in 2 moves, providing +1 score and growth. The food at (1,3) has a long life span (eaten by turn 34) and can be targeted later.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Eating (6,1) from the current position would trap the snake, as all adjacent cells are blocked by walls or body segments after consumption. Thus, (6,1) is avoided to prioritize survival.\n- **Movement Plan**: \n  - Turn 25: Move Up to (5,3) to position for eating (5,4).\n  - Turn 26: Move Up to (5,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows).\n  - After eating (5,4), move left to explore open space and head toward (1,3) gradually.\n  - Turns 27-29: Navigate left and down to avoid body collisions and approach (1,3) while staying in safe areas.\n\nThe planned moves for turns 25 to 29 are safe and align with long-term survival and scoring:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: L\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 26, and I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The grid has walls and obstacles, so I must not move into those cells.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning x and y go from 0 to 7 inclusive? Let's clarify: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, that might not be right. Typically in grids, if walls are at x=0 and x=7, that means x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x can be from 1 to 6? Let's see the coordinates given.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] – so y=1 is within the range, and it's not a wall. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think. But there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), which is not on the border.\n\nAlso, food positions: (6,1) with life span 3, value 1; (5,4) with life span 6, value 1; (1,3) with life span 9, value 1. All are positive food since value is +1.\n\nSnake head is at (5,3), direction is Up. So last move was Up, meaning I came from below, from (5,2).\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I cannot move Down on the next turn because of no instant reverse.\n\nI need to plan actions for turns 26, 27, 28, etc., at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\n(3,6) is an obstacle, so it's not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions: head at (5,3), then body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake has 8 segments.\n\nList:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,4)  // tail\n\nSince it's a list, index 0 is head, index 1 is first body, up to index 7 tail.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nNow, head direction is U, so moving up.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): Up, Down, Left, Right, but considering walls and no reverse.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move Down (reverse).\n\nAlso, cannot move into walls or obstacles.\n\nFrom (5,3):\n\n- Up: to (5,4)\n\n- Down: to (5,2) but (5,2) is occupied by body segment, but it's not the tail; let's see if it's safe.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves away.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail moves away from its current position.\n\nTherefore, moving into the tail's current position is safe because when you move, the tail leaves that cell.\n\nBut moving into any other body segment is deadly because those segments don't move until after the head moves, so if head moves to a body cell, it collides.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies.\n\n- If head moves to the tail's current cell, it is safe because after the move, the tail moves away and the head is there, but since the snake grows when it eats food, if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so if you eat food where the tail is, it might cause a problem, but there's a special rule.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the head is on the new tail, causing collision.\n\nIn this case, for moving to a cell:\n\n- If the cell is free, move is safe.\n\n- If the cell has food, and you move there, you eat it, and snake grows.\n\n- If the cell has a body segment, it's deadly unless it's the tail segment and you are not eating food there.\n\nBut if you move to the tail segment, and there is no food, it's safe because tail moves away.\n\nIf there is food on the tail segment, and you move there, you eat it, but since it's the tail, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nStandard: when snake eats food, it moves head to food cell, and the tail does not shorten; instead, it adds a new segment where the tail was, or something. I need to clarify the growth.\n\nFrom the rules: when eating positive food, length +1, so when head moves to food cell, the tail remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows by one.\n\nTherefore, if head moves to the tail cell:\n\n- If there is no food, it's safe: head moves to tail cell, tail moves away to the previous position, so no collision.\n\n- If there is food on the tail cell, and you move there, you eat the food, so snake grows: head is now on that cell, and since you ate food, the tail does not move; it stays, so now head and tail are on same cell? That would be collision.\n\nThe rules say: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nYes, so if the tail cell has food and you move head to it, you eat it, grow, and since tail doesn't move, head is on the cell and tail is also there, collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to tail cell is only safe if there is no food there; if there is food, it's deadly.\n\nSimilarly, for other body cells, always deadly.\n\nAlso for walls, deadly.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (5,3) at turn 26.\n\nCurrent head (5,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,4)\n\n- D: to (5,2) but (5,2) is body segment (index 1), not tail, so collision. Deadly.\n\n- L: to (4,3)\n\n- R: to (6,3)\n\nNow, check walls: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is x=4,y=3, which is between 1 and 6, not wall. Similarly (6,3) x=6,y=3, should be ok, since x=6 is not wall? Walls at x=7, so x=6 is playable? Let's confirm.\n\nWalls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable? Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to y=6 playable.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\n(5,4) is y=4, x=5, should be free.\n\nFirst, what cells are occupied by snake? List all snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo (4,3) is not occupied, (6,3) not occupied, (5,4) not occupied.\n\n(5,4) has food? Food positions: (6,1), (5,4), (1,3)\n\n(5,4) is a food position! With value 1, life span 6.\n\n(6,1) and (1,3) are others.\n\nSo from (5,3), moving U to (5,4) would eat the food there, since (5,4) has food.\n\nBut is it safe? Need to check for collisions.\n\n(5,4) is not occupied by body; let's see snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — no (5,4), so it's free, but has food.\n\nMoving U to (5,4) is possible, and would eat the food.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nOther moves: L to (4,3): what is (4,3)? Not occupied, no food mentioned, so free cell.\n\nR to (6,3): not occupied, no food, so free.\n\nD is impossible because reverse and body collision.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nU eats food, L and R do not.\n\nNow, life span of foods: at turn 26.\n\nFood at (6,1): life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns, meaning it will disappear on turn 26+3=29? Let's see the life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L it is gone? Or after L turns from now.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown to N-1\n\n- After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+(N-1), countdown 0, and it disappears before turn t+N or after?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1.\n\nThe food is present during the turn when countdown >0.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — I think it means that it will not be present after N turns have passed.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N, it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+(N-1), and disappears before turn t+N.\n\nSimilarly, if life span is 1, it is present only on the current turn, and disappears after.\n\nIn this case, turn 26:\n\nFood (6,1): life span 3, so present on turns 26,27,28? Countdown: at turn 26, countdown 3; after turn 26, it becomes 2; after turn 27, becomes 1; after turn 28, becomes 0, so disappears before turn 29? I think it's better to think the food is available as long as life span >0.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the beginning of turn, before action, the life span is given, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nFor movement, during the turn, if head moves to food cell with life span >0, it can be eaten.\n\nAfter the turn, life span decreases.\n\nFor (6,1) at turn 26, life span 3, so it can be eaten on turns 26,27,28. On turn 29, if life span was 0, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): life span 6, can be eaten from turn 26 to 31.\n\n(1,3): life span 9, turns 26 to 34.\n\nNow, back to turn 26 action.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows to length 9. New head at (5,4), and tail stays at (3,4) for now? No.\n\nWhen I eat food, head moves to (5,4), which was food, so I consume it, and since I ate, the snake grows: so the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not shorten; instead, a new segment is added at the end, so tail position remains.\n\nSequence: snake moves head to new position. If that position has food, it is eaten, and snake grows: the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the last body segment (tail) leaves its cell, and if no food eaten, that cell becomes empty.\n\nIf food eaten at head new position, then the tail does not move; it stays, so the snake gains one segment, and the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell:\n\n- New head position\n\n- Then seg1 moves to old head position\n\n- seg2 moves to old seg1 position\n\n- ...\n\n- tail moves to old second-last position, and old tail position is free, unless food eaten.\n\nIf food eaten, tail does not move; so new positions: new head, old head, old seg1, ..., old tail, and the old tail position is now part of body, not free.\n\nIn this case, when eating, the snake length increases by one, and the tail segment remains.\n\nNow for turn 26.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), eat food at (5,4), so new snake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Then the previous segments: old head (5,3) becomes new seg1\n\n- old seg1 (5,2) becomes new seg2\n\n- old seg2 (5,1) becomes new seg3\n\n- old seg3 (4,1) becomes new seg4\n\n- old seg4 (3,1) becomes new seg5\n\n- old seg5 (3,2) becomes new seg6\n\n- old seg6 (3,3) becomes new seg7\n\n- old seg7 (3,4) is tail, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new tail is still (3,4), and we add a new segment? No, when food eaten, the tail stays, so the new snake has the new head, then all old positions including tail, so length increases by one.\n\nAfter eating, positions: new head (5,4), then old head (5,3), then old seg1 (5,2), ..., up to old tail (3,4), so all 8 segments plus the new head position, but since head moved, it's 9 segments.\n\nList: after move to (5,4) with eat:\n\n- New positions: head at (5,4)\n\n- Body: (5,3)  // old head\n\n- (5,2)  // old seg1\n\n- (5,1)  // old seg2\n\n- (4,1)  // old seg3\n\n- (3,1)  // old seg4\n\n- (3,2)  // old seg5\n\n- (3,3)  // old seg6\n\n- (3,4)  // old tail, now new seg7 or tail? Since ate, tail remains, so positions are: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — so 9 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nOld tail was (3,4), and it stays.\n\nDirection: head moved U, so new direction is U.\n\nNow, life span of (5,4) was 6, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nOther foods: (6,1) life span 3, (1,3) life span 9.\n\nNow, after this move, on turn 27, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nBut we need to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nI should consider other options.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can go for other foods.\n\nFood at (6,1) has only life span 3, so it will disappear soon, by turn 28 or 29.\n\n(5,4) has longer life, but it's right above me.\n\n(1,3) is far, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, so moving right or up might be good.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should plan a path to eat multiple foods while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's list all cells.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo available cells: for each x,y in 1-6 except (3,6).\n\nSnake occupies: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo occupied cells: all these.\n\nFree cells: for example, (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) but (4,6) y=6, is it playable? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is not wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, y=6 is not wall.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) blocked.\n\nAlso, (5,4) has food, but if I don't eat now, it's there.\n\n(6,1) has food, (1,3) has food.\n\nNow, from (5,3), if I move U to (5,4), I eat, grow, head at (5,4).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction U, so cannot D (reverse).\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- U to (5,5)\n\n- D to (5,3) but (5,3) is now body segment, not tail, so collision. Deadly.\n\n- L to (4,4)\n\n- R to (6,4)\n\nNow, (5,5) : free? Snake positions after eat: (5,4) head, (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) tail. So (5,5) is free, no food mentioned.\n\n(4,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), no eat, then new head (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen body moves: since no eat, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3), since tail moved from (3,4) to (3,3)? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no eat: head to (5,5), then body: seg1 to old head (5,4), seg2 to old seg1 (5,3), ..., seg8 to old seg7 (3,3), and old tail (3,4) is free now. New tail is (3,3).\n\nPositions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nLength 9, but no growth.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), or L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), or D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nU to (5,6): y=6, is it wall? No, walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nBut (5,6) is free, I think.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) not.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5), (6,5) free.\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (6,1) is below, with short life.\n\nIf I go up, I might not reach (6,1) in time.\n\nLife span 3, at turn 26, so if not eaten by turn 28, it disappears.\n\nTurn 26: if I move U, I'm at (5,4) after turn 26.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4), if I move U to (5,5), at (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5), I can move to (5,6), but (6,1) is at y=1, far away; I can't reach it in one move.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,1) is |5-6| + |5-1| =1+4=5 moves away, at least 5 turns, but by turn 28, (6,1) life span was 3, after turn 26, life span 2, so on turn 27 it has life span 1? Let's clarify the countdown.\n\nAt turn 26, life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 26, life span decreases to 2 (for turn 27).\n\nAfter turn 27, decreases to 1 (for turn 28).\n\nAfter turn 28, decreases to 0, so on turn 29 it is gone. So it can be eaten on turn 27, 28, or 26.\n\nOn turn 26: if I move directly to (6,1), but from (5,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent; (5,3) to (6,1) is |5-6| + |3-1| =1+2=3, not adjacent, so I can't move there directly.\n\nAdjacent cells from (5,3) are (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is adjacent to (6,1)? (6,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent, down left or something.\n\nFrom (5,3), to reach (6,1), I need to go right and down, but down is blocked.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (6,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) or U to (6,4), etc, but (6,1) is below.\n\n(6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1).\n\nSo from (5,3), move R to (6,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen turn 27, from (6,3), move D to (6,2) — is (6,2) free? Currently, snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — no (6,2), so free, no food.\n\nThen after move to (6,2), no eat, so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3) from old head, then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)? Let's not get into details yet.\n\nThen turn 28, from (6,2), move D to (6,1), which has food, eat it, since life span on turn 28 is 1 (after turn 27 decrease to 1, so on turn 28 it can be eaten).\n\nLife span at turn 26:3, after turn 26:2, so on turn 27, life span 2; after turn 27:1, so on turn 28, life span 1, can be eaten; after turn 28:0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 28, I can eat (6,1) if I move there.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't go that way, I might miss it.\n\nBut (6,1) is positive food, +1 score.\n\nNow, back to turn 26 options.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,4), eat (5,4) food immediately. Score +1, snake grows to 9.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen I need to decide next moves.\n\nBut (6,1) food might expire soon.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can try to go down to reach (6,1), but down is blocked by body.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move R to (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (6,4), move D to (6,3) on turn 28? (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 26 U move: positions (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4), if move R to (6,4), no eat (assuming no food there), so new head (6,4), then body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)\n\nNow (6,4) to (6,1) is 3 steps down, but on turn 28, from (6,4) move D to (6,3), then turn 29 move D to (6,2), turn 30 to (6,1), but (6,1) life span: on turn 28, life span should be 1? Turn 26: ls=3, after 26:2, turn 27: ls=2, after 27:1, turn 28: ls=1, after 28:0, so on turn 29, it's gone, so I can't eat on turn 29. Turn 28 is the last chance to eat (6,1).\n\nOn turn 28, if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,2) or (6,4), not to (6,1) directly; (6,3) to (6,1) not adjacent.\n\nSo from (6,4) on turn 27, I can move to (6,3) on turn 28, but (6,3) is not (6,1), so I can't reach (6,1) on turn 28 from there.\n\nIf on turn 27 from (6,4) I move D to (6,3), then on turn 28 from (6,3) move D to (6,2), but (6,2) not (6,1), and (6,1) can only be reached from (6,2) or (5,1) or (7,1) but x=7 wall.\n\n(6,1) adjacent cells: (6,2), (5,1), (7,1) but (7,1) wall, so only (6,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is currently occupied by snake body.\n\nIn the initial state, (5,1) is snake, and after moves, it might move.\n\nBut in this path, on turn 28, if I am at (6,2), I can move to (6,1) if free.\n\nBut on turn 28, from (6,3) move to (6,2), then on turn 29 to (6,1), but (6,1) is gone by then.\n\nTurn 28: if I move to (6,2), and (6,1) has life span 0 on turn 28? No.\n\nOn turn 28, before action, life span of (6,1) is 1 (since decreased after each turn), so I can eat on turn 28 if I move to it.\n\nBut to move to (6,1) on turn 28, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 27.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,1) are (6,2), (5,1), and (6,0) but y=0 wall, so only (6,2) and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is snake body, so I can only reach from (6,2).\n\nSo on turn 27, I need to be at (6,2) to move to (6,1) on turn 28.\n\nNow, from turn 26 position.\n\nIf on turn 26, I move R to (6,3) instead of U.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,3) move R to (6,3), no eat ( (6,3) no food), so new positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3) since no eat, tail moved from (3,4) to (3,3)? Old positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAfter move R to (6,3) no eat: head to (6,3), then body: seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (5,2), seg3 to (5,1), seg4 to (4,1), seg5 to (3,1), seg6 to (3,2), seg7 to (3,3), and old tail (3,4) free. New tail (3,3).\n\nPositions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nLength 8, same.\n\nNow head at (6,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen turn 27: from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision, deadly. R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, deadly. So only U or D.\n\nNow, to reach (6,1) on turn 28, I need to move to (6,2) on turn 27.\n\nSo move D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is free, no food, so move D to (6,2), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) — tail at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 28: from (6,2), move D to (6,1), which has food, life span on turn 28 is 1 (can be eaten), so eat it, grow.\n\nNew head (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) — and since ate, tail stays, so positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nLength 9.\n\nScore +1.\n\nIf on turn 26 I moved U to (5,4), I ate (5,4), but then I couldn't reach (6,1) in time, so I miss that food.\n\nWith move R on turn 26, I can eat (6,1) on turn 28.\n\n(6,1) life span 3 at turn 26, so on turn 28 it can be eaten, yes.\n\nNow, another option: move L on turn 26 to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is free, no food, so move L to (4,3), no eat.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places, but (6,1) is far, and with short life, I might not reach it.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (6,1) is |4-6| + |3-1| =2+2=4 moves, at least 4 turns, so on turn 26 move L to (4,3), turn 27 from (4,3) move to say (4,2) or something, but (4,2) is free? Snake positions after move: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)\n\n(4,2) not occupied, so move D to (4,2) on turn 27? But (4,2) to (6,1) not close.\n\nTo reach (6,1) by turn 28, I need to be adjacent on turn 27, which from (4,3) on turn 27, I can only reach cells like (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3) but (3,3) and (5,3) are body, so only (4,4) or (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is closer to (6,1), but |4-6| + |2-1| =2+1=3, not adjacent, so on turn 28 I can't reach (6,1) from there. Too far.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,4), even farther.\n\nSo if I move L on turn 26, I cannot eat (6,1) in time; it will expire.\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,1), I need to go right and down quickly.\n\nSo move R on turn 26 is better for getting (6,1).\n\nBut there is also (5,4) food above with longer life.\n\nIf I go for (6,1), I might miss (5,4) if I don't go back, but (5,4) has life span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has long life.\n\nBut the snake body might block the way.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I can go back to (5,4) or to (1,3).\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,4), and (1,3) is at (1,3), so adjacent cells.\n\nBut head is at (5,3), far.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), which might affect movement in the top row.\n\nBut y=6 is playable except (3,6).\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nCurrently, with the snake coiled on the left, moving right might open space.\n\nLet's consider the options for turn 26.\n\nOption A: Move U to (5,4) - eat (5,4), score +1, but miss (6,1) likely.\n\nOption B: Move R to (6,3) - no eat, but can reach (6,1) on turn 28 for +1.\n\nOption C: Move L to (4,3) - no eat, but might not get either food soon, and (6,1) expires.\n\nSo B seems better for getting the short-life food.\n\nThen after that, I can go for other foods.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns.\n\nFirst, let's choose turn 26 action.\n\nSince (6,1) has short life and is positive, I should prioritize eating it before it expires.\n\n(5,4) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nSo I think move R to (6,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen, as above, turn 27 move D to (6,2), turn 28 move D to (6,1) eat.\n\nNow, on turn 28, after eating (6,1), head at (6,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen positions: as above, (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nNow, from (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut D to (6,0) y=0 wall, impossible.\n\nR to (7,1) x=7 wall, impossible.\n\nL to (5,1) but (5,1) is body segment, not tail, so collision, deadly.\n\nU to (6,2) but (6,2) is body segment, since after eating, (6,2) is the first body segment, so head moving to (6,2) would collide, deadly.\n\nSo from (6,1), after eating, I can only move to free cells, but U and L are body, D and R walls, so I have no safe move? That can't be right.\n\nPositions after turn 28 eat: head at (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,1):\n\n- Up: (6,2) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (6,0) - wall\n\n- Left: (5,1) - occupied by body ( (5,1) is in the list)\n\n- Right: (7,1) - wall\n\nSo all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied by body, so no possible move, snake dies immediately after turn 28.\n\nOh no! So if I go to (6,1), I trap myself because the body surrounds me.\n\nSpecifically, after moving down to (6,1), the cell above (6,2) is body, left (5,1) is body, down and right walls.\n\nSo indeed, no escape.\n\nTherefore, going to (6,1) is a death trap; I should not eat it, or find another way.\n\nBut (5,1) is body, and (6,2) is body, so yes.\n\nIn the positions, (5,1) is a body segment, and (6,2) is body, so head at (6,1) has no free adjacent cells.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,1) leads to immediate death on the next turn.\n\nSo it's not safe to eat (6,1).\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, even if I don't eat, but if I move to (6,1) without eating, but (6,1) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nBut in this case, eating it causes growth and I'm trapped.\n\nIf there were no food, moving to (6,1) might be possible, but there is food, so I must eat.\n\nSo (6,1) is a dangerous food because of the position.\n\nI should not go for (6,1).\n\nTherefore, option B is bad.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for it, I die.\n\nSo better to avoid (6,1) and let it expire.\n\nThen, option A: move U to (5,4) on turn 26, eat (5,4), then head at (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), as before, I can move U, L, or R.\n\nD to (5,3) is body, deadly.\n\nNow, possible: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nNow, (6,1) will expire soon, but I can't reach it safely, so ignore it.\n\nThen I can go for other foods or explore.\n\nBut there is (1,3) food.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,4), and (1,3) is at (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, after eating (5,4), positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTurn 27, from (5,4), let's say I move U to (5,5) for example.\n\nThen no eat, positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\n(5,6) is free, y=6 not wall.\n\n(4,5), (6,5) free.\n\nI can consider moving towards (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nFrom current, it's far.\n\nAlso, the body is on the bottom left, so moving up or right might be safer.\n\nAnother option: from turn 26, move L to (4,3).\n\nLet's evaluate that.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,3), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 27, from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3) but (3,3) is tail, so can move to it if no food.\n\n(3,3) has no food, so moving to (3,3) is safe because tail will move away.\n\nR to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, deadly.\n\nSo moves: U, D, or L to (3,3).\n\nNow, (3,3) is tail, so moving L to (3,3) is safe.\n\nThen after move, head to (3,3), tail moves to (3,2) or something.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nAfter move L to (3,3): since no eat, head to (3,3), then body: seg1 to (4,3), seg2 to (5,3), seg3 to (5,2), seg4 to (5,1), seg5 to (4,1), seg6 to (3,1), seg7 to (3,2), and old tail (3,3) is now head, but since moved to tail cell, and no food, tail moves to old second-last, which is (3,2)? Old positions: index 7 tail (3,3), index 6 (3,2), etc.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,3), then new seg1 at old head (4,3), new seg2 at old seg1 (5,3), new seg3 at old seg2 (5,2), new seg4 at old seg3 (5,1), new seg5 at old seg4 (4,1), new seg6 at old seg5 (3,1), new seg7 at old seg6 (3,2), and old tail (3,3) is now head, so tail is new seg7 at (3,2).\n\nPositions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nHead at (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen from here, I can move to (1,3) food.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), adjacent to (1,4), (1,2), (2,3), (0,3) wall.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (1,3), I need to move left twice.\n\nBut (3,3) to (2,3) to (1,3).\n\nNow, (2,3) is free? Currently not occupied.\n\nBut on turn 27, after moving to (3,3), positions as above.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,3), move L to (2,3), no eat (assuming no food), so new head (2,3), then body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nThen turn 29: from (2,3), move L to (1,3), which has food, value 1, life span on turn 29: at turn 26 ls=9, after 26:8, 27:7, 28:6, turn 29: ls=5? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 26: ls=9\n\nAfter turn 26: ls=8 (for turn 27)\n\nAfter turn 27: ls=7 (turn 28)\n\nAfter turn 28: ls=6 (turn 29)\n\nAfter turn 29: ls=5, etc.\n\nSo on turn 29, ls=6, can be eaten.\n\nMove to (1,3) eat food.\n\nBut is it safe? Head at (1,3), after eating.\n\nPositions after eat: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) and since ate, tail stays, so (3,2) is tail? Old tail was (3,2), and it remains.\n\nPositions: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nNow, from (1,3), adjacent cells: U (1,4), D (1,2), L (0,3) wall, R (2,3) body.\n\n(1,4) and (1,2) are free? Not occupied yet.\n\n(1,4) y=4, should be free, (1,2) y=2, free.\n\nSo I can move U or D.\n\nNo immediate trap.\n\nSo this seems possible.\n\nBut on turn 26, if I move L to (4,3), I can reach (1,3) by turn 29 and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I could have eaten (5,4) on turn 26, but I didn't.\n\nNow, compare to moving U on turn 26.\n\nIf move U on turn 26 to (5,4) eat, then I have score, but (6,1) expires, and (1,3) is far, but I can go to it.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), head at (5,4), then I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5), etc.\n\nTo go to (1,3), from (5,4) to (1,3) is |5-1| + |4-3| =4+1=5 moves, at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 26: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to say (4,4) or (5,5)\n\nSay move L to (4,4), no eat.\n\nThen head at (4,4), then I can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is tail or something, depending.\n\nPositions after turn 26 U move: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4) move L to (4,4), no eat, new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,4) move L to (3,4), but (3,4) is not occupied? In positions, (3,4) is not in the list; after turn 27, positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — so (3,4) is free.\n\n(3,4) is free, no food, so move L to (3,4), no eat.\n\nNew head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,4) move L to (2,4)? Or to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo go to (1,3), from (3,4) move to (2,4) or (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, so move to (2,4) or (3,5) or D to (3,3) occupied.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3) body deadly, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) body deadly.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nSay move L to (2,4), no eat.\n\nThen head (2,4), etc.\n\nThen turn 30 move to (2,3) or (1,4), then to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) can be eaten later, since life span long.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nWhereas if I move L on turn 26, I can eat (1,3) on turn 29.\n\nAlso, with move U on turn 26, I ate (5,4), so I have +1, but with move L, I didn't eat yet, but I can eat (1,3) later.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat food, but the timing.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) has life span 6, so if I don't eat on turn 26, I can eat it later, but the snake might block it.\n\nFor example, if I move L on turn 26 to (4,3), then (5,4) is still there, but I can go back to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) on turn 27, then to (5,4) on turn 28.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3) move U to (4,4), no eat ( (4,4) no food), new head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,4) move R to (5,4), which has food, life span at turn 28: turn 26 ls=6, after 26:5, 27:4, turn 28:4? After turn 27: ls=4 for turn 28.\n\nAt turn 28, ls=4>0, can eat.\n\nSo move to (5,4) eat, grow.\n\nNew head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) and since ate, tail stays, so (3,2) tail.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nThen from here, I can go to (1,3) as before.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), from (5,4) to (1,3) far.\n\nBut with life span 9, I have time.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) on turn 28, I can move towards (1,3).\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger for (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is near where the tail is, but tail moves.\n\nIn the state, tail is at (3,2), and (1,3) at (1,3), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nI think moving L on turn 26 is a good option, as it allows me to eat both (5,4) and (1,3) later.\n\nWith move U on turn 26, I eat (5,4) immediately, but then to eat (1,3), it takes more turns.\n\nAlso, with move L, I avoid the risk of (6,1).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to provide actions from turn 26 onwards for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince the state can change, I should plan a path.\n\nBut to start, let's choose turn 26 action.\n\nI think moving L to (4,3) is safer and allows flexibility.\n\nThen from there, I can go to eat (5,4) or to (1,3).\n\nBut (5,4) is above, (1,3) is left.\n\nSince (5,4) has shorter life than (1,3) but both long, I can eat (5,4) first.\n\nLife span (5,4) 6, (1,3) 9, so (5,4) disappears after turn 31, (1,3) after turn 34.\n\nTurn 26 to eat (5,4) by turn 31.\n\nWith move L on turn 26, I can eat (5,4) on turn 28 as above.\n\nThen eat (1,3) later.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U on turn 26, I eat (5,4) immediately, then go for (1,3).\n\nBut with move U, I have the food now, but the body might be more coiled.\n\nLet's compare the positions.\n\nAfter turn 26 move U: positions (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — so the snake is vertical on x=5 from y=1 to 4, then horizontal at y=1 from x=3 to 5, and up on x=3 from y=1 to 4.\n\nAfter move L to (4,3): positions (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — so head at (4,3), tail at (3,3), with body on bottom left.\n\nThen moving to (4,4) and (5,4) opens space.\n\nI think both are possible, but to avoid the short-life food and for long-term, moving L might be better.\n\nBut let's think about the grid size and survival.\n\nThe grid is 6x6 playable, minus obstacle, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 8, so 27 free cells.\n\nAfter growth, more occupied.\n\nTo survive long, I need to have space to move.\n\nCurrently, the bottom left is crowded, so moving right or up might be better.\n\nMove R on turn 26 to (6,3) but then I can't go to (6,1) safely, but I can go up.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2), but D to (6,2) might lead to dead end.\n\nFrom (6,3), move U to (6,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen to (6,5) etc.\n\nBut no food there, and I miss (5,4) and (1,3).\n\n(5,4) can be eaten from (6,4) or something.\n\nFor example, on turn 26 move R to (6,3), no eat.\n\nTurn 27 move U to (6,4), no eat.\n\nThen turn 28 move L to (5,4), eat (5,4).\n\nSimilarly possible.\n\nBut then (1,3) is far.\n\nI think the best is to move L on turn 26 to (4,3), then I can access both areas.\n\nSo for turn 26, action L.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nLet's plan 5 turns: turns 26 to 30.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,3)\n\nAfter move, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), or D to (4,2), or L to (3,3) which is tail, safe.\n\nTo eat (5,4), I should move U to (4,4).\n\nMove U to (4,4), no eat (no food at (4,4)), so new positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4), move R to (5,4), which has food, life span at turn 28: turn 26 ls=6, after 26:5, after 27:4, so turn 28 ls=4>0, eat it.\n\nSo move R to (5,4) eat.\n\nNew head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) and since ate, tail stays at (3,2), so positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, deadly, L to (4,4) body deadly, R to (6,4).\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(5,5) or (6,4).\n\nNow, to go to (1,3), I can move R to (6,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nSay move U to (5,5) for now.\n\nNo eat, new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail at (3,1)? Let's see: after move, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nBefore: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAfter move U to (5,5) no eat: head to (5,5), then seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (5,3), seg5 to (5,2), seg6 to (5,1), seg7 to (4,1), seg8 to (3,1), and old tail (3,2) free. New tail (3,1).\n\nPositions: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nTurn 30: from (5,5), move to (5,6) or (4,5) or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to head towards (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), so I should move left and down.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5) for example.\n\nBut let's not plan too far, as the state changes.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) is safe to eat later, and I have it in mind.\n\nBut for now, with this plan, I ate (5,4) on turn 28.\n\nIf I had moved U on turn 26, I ate on turn 26.\n\nBut in terms of score, same, but with move L, I ate later, but I have the option for (1,3).\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 29, I can start moving left.\n\nBut (3,1) is body, so I need to go around.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo prioritize long-term, moving L on turn 26 seems good.\n\nSo for turn 26: L\n\nThen for the next turns, I can define based on the plan.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the AI is playing, I can provide the sequence as per the plan.\n\nLet's outline:\n\nTurn 26: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 27: U (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 28: R (to (5,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4), only U or R possible, as D and L are body.\n\nI can move R to (6,4) to go right, or U to (5,5) to go up.\n\nMoving R to (6,4) might be better to avoid the left crowded area.\n\nTurn 29: R to (6,4)\n\nNo eat, positions: after turn 28 eat: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAfter move R to (6,4) no eat: head to (6,4), then seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (5,3), seg5 to (5,2), seg6 to (5,1), seg7 to (4,1), seg8 to (3,1), tail at (3,1), old tail (3,2) free.\n\nPositions: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nTurn 30: from (6,4), move U to (6,5), or D to (6,3), or L to (5,4) body, or R to (7,4) wall. So U or D.\n\nSay move U to (6,5) to explore top.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to think about (1,3) later.\n\nSince life span is long, I can do it.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide the first few actions.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nSo I can provide turns 26 to 30 or 31.\n\nLet's decide on turn 26 action.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,4) could be eaten later, but in the move L plan, I eat it on turn 28.\n\nIf I move U, I eat on turn 26.\n\nBut in both, I eat it.\n\nWith move U, I have the score earlier, but the position might be similar.\n\nBut with move L, I have more flexibility to go left for (1,3).\n\nI think L is fine.\n\nSo for turn 26, action L.\n\nThen turn 27: U (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 28: R (to (5,4) eat)\n\nThen for turn 29: from (5,4), after eating, I can move R to (6,4) as above.\n\nThen turn 30: from (6,4), move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nTo keep options open, move U to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 31: from (6,5), move to (6,6) or (5,5) or (7,5) wall, so U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nBut (6,6) y=6, not wall, but obstacle at (3,6), so (6,6) free.\n\nThen I can go down left later for (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) life span 9, so on turn 31, ls=9-5=4? Turn 26 ls=9, after 26:8, 27:7, 28:6, 29:5, 30:4, turn 31 ls=4>0, so still time.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: R\n\nTurn 29: R (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 30: U (to (6,5))\n\nBut on turn 29, from (5,4), after turn 28, head at (5,4), direction R (since moved right to it).\n\nThen move R to (6,4), possible.\n\nThen turn 30 from (6,4) move U to (6,5).\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nSince 5 turns, turns 26 to 30.\n\nBut turn 26 to 30 is 5 actions.\n\nTurns: 26,27,28,29,30 — 5 turns.\n\nActions: L, U, R, R, U\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 28 I ate food, good.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, on turn 27, when I move U to (4,4), is it safe? Yes, free cell.\n\nTurn 28 move R to (5,4), eat, safe.\n\nTurn 29 move R to (6,4), free.\n\nTurn 30 move U to (6,5), free.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I had moved U on turn 26, I could have similar later moves, but this is fine.\n\nSo I think this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the long-term score and ensure survival, the AI must prioritize eating positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The current state (turn 26) shows the snake at positions [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] with head direction Up. Food is available at (6,1) with life span 3 (expiring after turn 28), (5,4) with life span 6 (expiring after turn 31), and (1,3) with life span 9 (expiring after turn 34). The grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:\n- **Immediate Risks**: \n  - (6,1) is high-risk due to limited adjacent safe cells; eating it could trap the snake (e.g., moving to (6,1) on turn 28 leaves no safe exit).\n  - (5,4) is safe to eat and can be targeted soon, as it has a longer life span.\n  - (1,3) has a long life span and can be eaten later; moving left early provides access.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is Up, so Down is invalid on turn 26 (no instant reverse).\n  - Avoid body segments except the tail (if no food is present). Tail at (3,4) has no food, so moving to it is safe if needed.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - The bottom-left area (x=3-5, y=1-3) is crowded with snake body. Moving left on turn 26 opens space and allows access to (1,3) later.\n  - Eating (5,4) by turn 28 is efficient, as it avoids missing it due to life span or body blockage.\n  - After turn 28, moving right and up explores open areas, avoiding the crowded left and preparing for (1,3) consumption later.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - Skip (6,1) due to high risk; let it expire.\n  - Target (5,4) on turn 28 for +1 score and growth.\n  - Target (1,3) around turns 32-34 (not in this 5-turn plan but considered for long-term).\n- **5-Turn Path Safety**: \n  - Turns 26-28: Move left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then right to (5,4) to eat food safely.\n  - Turns 29-30: Move right to (6,4) and up to (6,5) to access open areas, avoiding body collisions and walls.\n  - All moves are validated for collision and wall safety at each step.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 26-30):\n- **Turn 26 (t=26)**: Move Left (L) to (4,3).  \n  - Why: Avoids (6,1) risk, accesses open space, and positions for (5,4). Direction becomes Left.\n- **Turn 27 (t=27)**: Move Up (U) to (4,4).  \n  - Why: Prepares to reach (5,4); no food here, so no growth. Direction becomes Up.\n- **Turn 28 (t=28)**: Move Right (R) to (5,4).  \n  - Why: Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1); life span 4 > 0. Direction becomes Right.\n- **Turn 29 (t=29)**: Move Right (R) to (6,4).  \n  - Why: Explores right side; no food, avoids body collisions. Direction becomes Right.\n- **Turn 30 (t=30)**: Move Up (U) to (6,5).  \n  - Why: Continues to open area; no food, but sets up for future movement toward (1,3) or other food. Direction becomes Up.\n\n### Path Visualization and Validation:\n- **After Turn 26 (L)**: Snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] (tail at (3,3)). (6,1) life span decreases to 2.\n- **After Turn 27 (U)**: Positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] (tail at (3,2)). (6,1) life span decreases to 1 (last chance on turn 28, but skipped).\n- **After Turn 28 (R)**: Positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] (length 9, tail at (3,2)). (5,4) eaten; (6,1) expires after turn.\n- **After Turn 29 (R)**: Positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] (tail at (3,1)).\n- **After Turn 30 (U)**: Positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] (tail at (4,1)).\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond 5 Turns):\n- **Target (1,3)**: From turn 30 position (6,5), move left/down (e.g., (5,5) → (4,5) → ...) to reach (1,3) by ~turn 33-34. Life span 9 ensures availability.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (1,3), avoid the top row near (3,6) obstacle. Prioritize open spaces to prevent trapping.\n- **Risks Mitigated**: (6,1) avoided; (5,4) eaten safely; no collisions in plan.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating one food (+1) and sets up for future food, while ensuring survival through open-area movement.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 27: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 28: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 29: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 30: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 28,
        "score": 8,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 28. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,5) from below, so previous position was (5,4), and direction U means it's facing up.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,1) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Since it's turn 28, and life span 1, it will disappear at the end of turn 28 if not eaten. But we're making a move for turn 28, so we can eat it this turn if we move to (6,1).\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 7. So it has 7 turns left including this one.\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 10. Value 1 for all, so all are positive food? Value is given as 1 for each, so all are positive food, no negative food here. Value 1 means +1, so positive.\n\nIn the food list, it says: (6,1,1,1), (1,3,7,1), (4,6,10,1). I think the format is (x, y, life_span, value). For (6,1): x=6, y=1, life_span=1, value=1. Similarly, (1,3,7,1) is x=1,y=3, life_span=7, value=1. (4,6,10,1) x=4,y=6, life_span=10, value=1. All value 1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, head is at (5,5), direction U (up). Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) immediately because that would be reverse. The rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since head direction is U, I cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions for turn 28: U (up to (5,6)), L (left to (4,5)), or R (right to (6,5)). D is not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid from (0,0) to (7,7), walls on borders and at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (5,5)\n\nBody: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nSo the snake occupies: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nFood at: (6,1), (1,3), (4,6)\n\n(6,1) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n\n(1,3) life span 7, (4,6) life span 10.\n\nNow, for turn 28, possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U: to (5,6)\n\n- L: to (4,5)\n\n- R: to (6,5)\n\nD is not possible due to reverse move.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each option for safety and potential to get food.\n\nFirst, let's check if moving to these cells is safe.\n\n(5,6): is this a wall? Walls are borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and (3,6). (5,6) is within bounds, x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. (3,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) is different, so no wall. Is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (5,6), so empty. So (5,6) is free.\n\n(4,5): not border, not (3,6), and snake positions: (4,1) is body, but (4,5) is not listed, so should be free. Snake has (4,1) but that's different cell. (4,5) is free.\n\n(6,5): not border, not obstacle, snake has (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (6,5), so free.\n\nAll three moves seem safe immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (6,1) can be eaten if we move to it, but head is at (5,5), not adjacent to (6,1). To eat (6,1), we need to move head there.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving R to (6,5) gets us closer to (6,1), but not directly.\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), head at (5,5). Distance: Δx=1, Δy=4, so not adjacent.\n\nSince (6,1) has life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so only this turn we can eat it. If we don't eat it now, it's gone.\n\nBut to eat it this turn, we need to be at (6,1) at the start of turn, but we're at (5,5), so we can't reach it in one move. From (5,5), moving to (6,5) is one step, but (6,5) to (6,1) is multiple steps. We can only move one cell per turn.\n\nSo we cannot eat (6,1) this turn because it's too far. (6,1) is at distance |5-6| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5 cells away, so min 5 moves, but since life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so impossible to eat it. Therefore, (6,1) will disappear and cannot be eaten. So we should ignore it for now.\n\nLife span 1 means it disappears after the current turn. Since we're on turn 28, and we make a move, after that move, the food life decreases. Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for (6,1), life_span=1 at turn 28. When we start turn 28, it's there. After we make the move for turn 28, the life span decreases to 0, and it disappears. So we can only eat it during turn 28 if we move onto it during this turn.\n\nBut head is at (5,5), and (6,1) is not adjacent, so we can't move to it directly. The only way to eat it is if we were adjacent and moved onto it, but we're not adjacent. So indeed, impossible to eat (6,1) this turn, so it will be gone after turn 28. So we don't need to consider it.\n\nNow, other food: (1,3) life span 7, (4,6) life span 10.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is above and left of head (5,5). (4,6) is x=4,y=6.\n\nHead at (5,5), so (4,6) is one left and one up, so adjacent? Δx=1, Δy=1, not adjacent horizontally or vertically; diagonal, so not directly adjacent for movement. To move to (4,6) from (5,5), we need to go to a neighbor first.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,5), moving L to (4,5) gets us closer, then from (4,5) to (4,6) is U, but we have to consider the path.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and down, but let's plot.\n\nFirst, let's think about the immediate move for turn 28.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move U to (5,6)\n\n2. Move L to (4,5)\n\n3. Move R to (6,5)\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will grow if it eats food, but there's no food at these cells, so moving to any of these won't eat food, so snake length remains the same, tail moves, etc.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves, so the body shifts.\n\nNow, I need to simulate a few moves ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,3). Head is at (5,5), not adjacent to (3,3). Distance |5-3| + |5-3| = 2+2=4, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n\nFood at (4,6) is close, but not on tail.\n\nNow, let's consider each move for turn 28.\n\nFirst, move U to (5,6):\n\n- New head position: (5,6)\n\n- Since no food eaten, tail moves from (3,3) to? The body: current positions: head to (5,6), then the body: since head moved to (5,6), the first body segment (5,4) becomes new neck, but the tail end (3,3) is removed, so new snake positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] \n\nOriginal: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving U to (5,6), head is now (5,6), and the body shifts: the segment that was (5,5) is now the first body part, so positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). The tail (3,3) is gone, and (3,2) is the new tail.\n\nNow, head direction is now U, since we moved up.\n\nFood: (4,6) is at (4,6), which is adjacent to new head (5,6)? (5,6) and (4,6) are left and same y, so adjacent horizontally. We can move to (4,6) next turn if we choose L.\n\nBut (4,6) has food, value 1.\n\nIf we move to (4,6) on next turn, we eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\nNow, second option: move L to (4,5) for turn 28.\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] and tail (3,3) gone, new tail (3,2)? Original positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving L to (4,5): head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). Tail (3,3) gone.\n\nNow, (4,6) is above (4,5), so if we move U next, we can go to (4,6) and eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, third option: move R to (6,5)\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Body: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] tail (3,3) gone.\n\nFrom (6,5), we can move to various places.\n\nBut (6,1) food is gone, so no food nearby except (4,6) and (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and down.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is a wall.\n\nAlso, borders are walls.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, we need to avoid dead ends and plan a path to food.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U to (5,6) on turn 28.\n\nThen, on turn 29, from (5,6), we can move U, D, L, R, but head direction U, so cannot move D (reverse).\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- U to (5,7): but y=7 is border wall, so cannot, it's a wall.\n\n- D to (5,5): but (5,5) is now body? After move to (5,6), body includes (5,5), so moving D to (5,5) would collide with body.\n\n- L to (4,6): (4,6) has food? Yes, (4,6) is a food position with value 1.\n\n- R to (6,6): (6,6) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied? Snake has (6,5)? After turn 28 move U to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (6,6), so free.\n\nSo from (5,6) on turn 29, possible: L to (4,6) or R to (6,6). U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body, so only L or R.\n\nIf we move L to (4,6), we eat the food at (4,6), since it's positive, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (4,6), and the tail does not move, so the body stays the same except head moves to (4,6).\n\nCurrent before move: head at (5,6), body: (5,5), (5,4), ..., down to (3,2)\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) and eating food: new head (4,6), and the body segments remain, so snake becomes: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] and since we ate, tail stays, so we have 10 segments now? Original 9, eat food, grow to 10.\n\nOriginal snake length 9 positions. After move without eating, it would be 9 with tail moving. But when eating, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: before move, 9 segments. After move to empty cell, new head, tail removed, still 9. After move to food, new head, tail not removed, so length 10.\n\nHere, moving to (4,6) which has food, so we eat it, grow to 10 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes first body, so: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] \n\n(3,2) is the tail, and (3,3) was removed earlier, but after growth, no removal.\n\nNow, head at (4,6), direction from (5,6) to (4,6) is left, so head direction L.\n\nFrom here, we can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), and there's a wall at (3,6), which is adjacent left? (3,6) is directly left of (4,6), but (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nAlso, U to (4,7): y=7 border wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,5): is it free? (4,5) is not in snake positions now? Current snake: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., (5,5) is body, so (4,5) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nR to (5,6): but (5,6) is body, cannot.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5), or R to (5,6) but occupied, no; adjacent cells: left (3,6) wall, up (4,7) wall, down (4,5), right (5,6) occupied by body.\n\n(5,6) is the first body segment, so head at (4,6), right is (5,6) which is body, so cannot move right.\n\nDown to (4,5): should be free.\n\nIs there any other? Diagonals not allowed, only U,D,L,R.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,6) is D to (4,5).\n\nThat seems dangerous because only one choice.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) on turn 29, we have to move to (4,5) on turn 30, but let's see.\n\nFirst, back to turn 28 choice.\n\nIf on turn 28 we move U to (5,6), then on turn 29 we have to move L or R.\n\nIf we move L to (4,6), we eat food, but then we are stuck at (4,6) with only one move down to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 30, from (4,6) move D to (4,5).\n\nNow, head to (4,5), and since we ate on turn 29, no growth, so tail moves? After eating on turn 29, snake grew to 10 segments.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) on turn 30: no food at (4,5), I assume, so we don't eat, so head moves to (4,5), and tail moves, which is (3,2) removed, so positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) and (3,2) gone? Tail was (3,2), but after growth, positions are: before move turn 30: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) — 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,5): new head (4,5), and since no food, tail (3,2) is removed, so new positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] 10 segments? Head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), ..., down to (3,1). (3,1) is the new tail.\n\nNow, head at (4,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move U (reverse) because direction is D.\n\nU would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nNow, (5,5) is occupied by body? Current positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., so (5,5) is body, so cannot move R to (5,5).\n\nL to (3,5): (3,5) not wall? Walls: (3,6) is wall, but (3,5) is not, and not border, so should be free.\n\nD to (4,4): free, probably.\n\n(4,4) not occupied.\n\nSo from (4,5), we can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\nThis seems manageable, but we are in a tight spot.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 29 at (5,6): instead of moving L to (4,6), we could move R to (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,6), move R to (6,6).\n\nThen no food eaten, so tail moves, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and (3,2) gone? After turn 28 U to (5,6), positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nMove R to (6,6): new head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), ..., (4,1), (3,1), tail (3,2) removed, so new tail (3,1).\n\nPositions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen we can move from there, but no food nearby, and we missed the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has life span 10, so it will be there for a while.\n\nBut by moving R, we didn't eat it.\n\nNow, let's consider other turn 28 moves.\n\nSecond option: move L to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nFrom (5,5) move L to (4,5).\n\nNew head (4,5), body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] tail (3,3) gone.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow, from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move R (reverse) because direction L, so R not allowed.\n\nU to (4,6): (4,6) has food, so we can eat it.\n\nD to (4,4): free\n\nL to (3,5): free? (3,5) not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo possible: U, D, or L.\n\nIf we move U to (4,6) on turn 29, we eat the food, grow to 10 segments.\n\nThen head at (4,6), same as before, and only can move D to (4,5) next, which is similar to previous scenario.\n\nIf we don't move U, we could move D or L.\n\nBut (4,6) food is there, and we want to eat it, so moving U might be good to get the food.\n\nBut then we get stuck at (4,6) with only one exit.\n\nThird option for turn 28: move R to (6,5)\n\nFrom (5,5) move R to (6,5).\n\nNew head (6,5), body: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] tail (3,3) gone.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), but L is reverse, not allowed since direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nR to (7,5): x=7 is border wall, cannot.\n\nSo possible: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,6) free, (6,4) free.\n\nNo food at these, so no eating.\n\nThen we can go to (6,6) or (6,4), but no immediate food.\n\n(1,3) food is available, life span 7, so we can go for it later.\n\n(4,6) is also available.\n\nBut with move R on turn 28, we are moving away from (4,6).\n\nNow, to maximize score, we should try to eat the foods.\n\n(4,6) is close, at (4,6), and we can reach it in one or two moves depending on path.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is farther.\n\nLife span of (4,6) is 10, (1,3) is 7, so both have time, but (1,3) might disappear sooner if we delay.\n\n7 turns left, including turn 28, so after turn 28, life span decreases to 6, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on turn 28 decision.\n\nPerhaps moving L to (4,5) is better because it directly allows us to move to (4,6) next turn to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if we move U to (5,6), we can move to (4,6) to eat.\n\nBut in both cases, after eating (4,6), we are at (4,6) with only one move down to (4,5).\n\nThen from there, we have to navigate.\n\nBut there's a risk if we get trapped.\n\nLet's map the area around (4,6).\n\n(4,6): left (3,6) wall, up (4,7) wall, right (5,6) might be occupied, down (4,5).\n\nSo only down is free when at (4,6).\n\nAfter moving down to (4,5), then from (4,5), we can move D to (4,4), L to (3,5), or if possible R but (5,5) is body.\n\nIn the case where we ate at (4,6), then moved to (4,5), positions include (5,5) as body, so from (4,5), moving R to (5,5) is body collision.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nL to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) is free, (4,4) is free.\n\nThen from there, we can explore.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (3,1) or something, but it moves.\n\nPerhaps we should consider not eating (4,6) immediately to avoid being trapped.\n\nBut it's a positive food, so we should eat it if possible.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to eat it without getting stuck.\n\nFor example, if we approach from below.\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, head at (5,5) y=5.\n\nIf we go to (5,6) first, then to (4,6), but same as before.\n\nOr directly to (4,5) then to (4,6).\n\nBut when we go to (4,6), we are at corner.\n\nUnless we can move away after.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), we can go to (3,5) or (4,4).\n\n(3,5) is near the wall at (3,6), but (3,5) is free.\n\nThen from (3,5), we can move U to (3,6), but (3,6) is wall, cannot; D to (3,4); L to (2,5); R to (4,5) but occupied.\n\nSo options.\n\nBut let's think about the other food at (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nCurrent head at (5,5), so we need to move left and down.\n\nAlso, there are walls and the snake body.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (3,3) now, but after moves, it changes.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but no food on tail now.\n\nBut in the future, if food spawns, but not now.\n\nFor long-term, we need to have space to move.\n\nLet's list all free cells or something.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nOccupied by snake: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nFood at (1,3), (4,6)\n\n(6,1) is gone after this turn.\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,1) to (0,7) but x=0 wall, so not free.\n\nCells not wall and not snake: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls only borders and (3,6), so free cells except snake and (3,6).\n\nSnake occupies 9 cells, wall at (3,6), so 64 - 16 border walls - 1 internal wall - 9 snake = 38 free cells? Total cells 8x8=64.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, but corners counted once, so number of border wall cells: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, 8 cells each, left and right columns x=0 and x=7, but corners shared, so 2*8 + 2*8 - 4 corners = 16+16-4=28? Better: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, number: for x=0, y=0 to 7: 8 cells, x=7, y=0 to 7: 8, y=0, x=1 to 6: 6 cells (since x=0 and x=7 already counted), similarly y=7, x=1 to 6: 6 cells. So total border walls: 8 (x=0) + 8 (x=7) + 6 (y=0) + 6 (y=7) = 28 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6), one cell.\n\nSo total wall cells: 28 + 1 = 29.\n\nSnake: 9 cells.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 - 9 = 26 cells? 64-29=35, minus 9 snake, 26 free cells.\n\nBut including food cells.\n\nFood at (1,3) and (4,6) are free but have food.\n\nNow, back to turn 28.\n\nPerhaps for turn 28, moving L to (4,5) is good because it sets us to eat (4,6) next turn.\n\nThen after eating, we move down to (4,5), but (4,5) will be occupied or not.\n\nIn the sequence: if turn 28 move L to (4,5), no eat, so positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,2), tail (3,3) gone.\n\nThen turn 29, move U to (4,6), eat food, grow to 10 segments: head (4,6), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,2), and tail not moved, so (3,2) is still there, positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nNow turn 30, from (4,6), only move D to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body, occupied! Oh no!\n\nProblem.\n\nHead at (4,6), down to (4,5), but (4,5) is the first body segment, so moving to (4,5) would collide with body, death.\n\nSo it's impossible to move down to (4,5) because it's occupied.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was free, but after eating, (4,5) is part of the body.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,6) on turn 29, the cell (4,5) is occupied by the second segment, so from (4,6), moving down to (4,5) is into the body, collision.\n\nAnd other directions are wall or occupied, so no move possible, snake dies.\n\nSimilarly, if we had moved U to (5,6) on turn 28, then L to (4,6) on turn 29, same thing: after eating, head at (4,6), body includes (5,6) and so on, down to (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nLet's check.\n\nTurn 28 move U to (5,6): positions [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 29 move L to (4,6): eat food, grow to 10: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves: left (3,6) wall, up (4,7) wall, right (5,6) body, down (4,5) — is (4,5) occupied? In the positions, (4,5) is not listed, so it should be free. Current positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., (3,2), no (4,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nSo we can move down to (4,5) on turn 30.\n\nThen no problem.\n\nIn the first case, when we moved L to (4,5) on turn 28, then U to (4,6) on turn 29, (4,5) became part of the body, so when at (4,6), down to (4,5) is body.\n\nBut in this case, with move U then L, (4,5) is not occupied, so we can move down.\n\nSo the sequence matters.\n\nTherefore, for eating (4,6), it's better to approach from the right or below, not from below if we just moved there.\n\nSpecifically, to eat (4,6) safely, we should not have the cell below occupied when we are at (4,6).\n\nIn the move U to (5,6) then L to (4,6), (4,5) is free, so we can move down after.\n\nIf we go directly to (4,5) then up, (4,5) is occupied when we are at (4,6).\n\nSo better to go via (5,6).\n\nFor turn 28, moving U to (5,6) allows us to eat (4,6) next turn and then move down safely.\n\nMoving L to (4,5) also allows us to eat (4,6) next turn, but then we are stuck with body below.\n\nSo moving U to (5,6) is better for (4,6).\n\nMoving R to (6,5) doesn't help with (4,6).\n\nNow, about the other food (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), life span 7.\n\nWe can go there after eating (4,6).\n\nAlso, after eating (4,6), snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but we need the score.\n\nNow, for turn 28, I think moving U to (5,6) is a good choice.\n\nThen turn 29, move L to (4,6) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 30, move D to (4,5).\n\nNow, after that, we need to plan.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 28: move U to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,6), move L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nHead direction after U is U, so moving L is allowed, not reverse.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (4,5), which is down, not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen at (4,5), direction D.\n\nNow, from (4,5), we can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, to reach (1,3), we need to go left and down.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), so from (4,5), we can go left to (3,5), then to (2,5), (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3), but need to see if path clear.\n\nAlso, life span of (1,3) is 7, so we have time.\n\nSince we are at turn 28, after eating (4,6) on turn 29, we have 6 turns left for (1,3) life span (after turn 29, life decreases to 6, then 5, etc.).\n\nTurn 28: current turn, food (1,3) life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 28 + 6 = turn 34? Countdown: at turn t, life span N, decreases each turn including t, so after N turns, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 28, life span 7, so it exists until after turn 28 + 6 = turn 34? Let's see: turn 28: life span 7, after turn 28, life span 6 (for turn 29), after turn 29, life span 5, ..., after turn 33, life span 1, after turn 34, life span 0, disappears. So last chance to eat is on turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 10 at turn 28, so disappears after turn 37.\n\nBut we eat (4,6) on turn 29.\n\nNow for (1,3), we need to eat by turn 34.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 30, we can head towards (1,3).\n\nFor example, move to (3,5) or (4,4), then to lower left.\n\nBut let's not plan all moves yet.\n\nFirst, for turn 28, move U to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 29, move L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 30, move D to (4,5).\n\nNow, at (4,5), we have options.\n\nTo go to (1,3), moving left might be better, to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is near (3,6) wall.\n\nMove to (3,5) on turn 31.\n\nThen from (3,5), we can move D to (3,4), L to (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) to (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), so from (1,4) or (1,2) or (2,3), etc.\n\nBut we need to ensure the path is safe.\n\nSince snake is long, we need to avoid boxing ourselves.\n\nAnother thing: after moving to (4,5) on turn 30, positions depend.\n\nLet's simulate the positions after turn 30.\n\nStart from turn 28 move U to (5,6):\n\n- Turn 28: head to (5,6), no eat, tail (3,3) gone, positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 29: move L to (4,6), eat food at (4,6), grow, no tail move, positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] 10 segments.\n\nTurn 30: move D to (4,5), no food, so tail moves, remove (3,2), new positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] head (4,5), tail (3,1)\n\nNow, head at (4,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot U (reverse).\n\nD to (4,4): free\n\nL to (3,5): free\n\nR to (5,5): but (5,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf we move L to (3,5) on turn 31.\n\nThen head to (3,5), no food, tail moves, remove (3,1), new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] tail (4,1)\n\nHead direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6): but (3,6) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (3,4): free\n\nL to (2,5): free\n\nR to (4,5): body, cannot.\n\nSo U wall, R body, so only D or L.\n\nMove to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nTo reach (1,3), moving left to (2,5) might be better.\n\nThen continue.\n\nWe have time, but I think for the answer, we need to specify actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is for actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since we need to think ahead, perhaps a few moves.\n\nIn this case, for turn 28, I think U is good.\n\nBut let's consider if moving R to (6,5) is better for long-term.\n\nMove R to (6,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (6,5), can move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nSay move U to (6,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen positions: after turn 28 move R to (6,5): head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,2), tail (3,3) gone.\n\nTurn 29 move U to (6,6): no eat, tail moves, remove (3,2), positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] tail (3,1)\n\nNow from (6,6), can move U, D, L, R, but U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, D to (6,5) body, L to (5,6) free? (5,6) not occupied, so L to (5,6).\n\nThen we can go to (5,6), and (4,6) is still there, but we missed the chance to eat it directly.\n\nFrom (5,6), we can move to (4,6) to eat, but then at (4,6), down to (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn this position, after turn 29, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), etc., (4,5) is free? Not occupied, so if we move to (4,6) later, (4,5) might be free.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 30 from (6,6) move L to (5,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 31, from (5,6) move L to (4,6), eat, grow.\n\nThen from (4,6), down to (4,5) should be free.\n\nBut we used more moves, and (1,3) might be time-sensitive.\n\nLife span 7, so we have until turn 34.\n\nBut moving to the right first might delay reaching (1,3).\n\nTherefore, moving U directly to (5,6) on turn 28 is better to get the food quickly.\n\nMoreover, after eating, we have a longer snake, but we can manage.\n\nSo for turn 28, move U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, we can plan to go to (1,3).\n\nBut for the answer, since we need to specify multiple actions, but the state is for turn t1=28, so we should give actions for turn 28,29,30,etc.\n\nBut how many? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format can have multiple lines.\n\nPerhaps give actions for the next few turns to show the plan.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output actions for immediate turns.\n\nI think for turn 28, move U.\n\nTurn 29, move L to eat (4,6)\n\nTurn 30, move D to (4,5)\n\nThen from there, say move L to (3,5) on turn 31, etc.\n\nBut let's see the path to (1,3).\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 30, move L to (3,5) on turn 31.\n\nThen turn 32, from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 33, from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 34, from (1,5) move D to (1,4)\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), so from (1,4) to (1,3) is down, but on turn 35? We need to eat by turn 34.\n\nTurn 34 is the last chance.\n\nCurrent turn 28.\n\nAfter turn 30: we are at (4,5) on turn 30.\n\nTurn 31: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 33: move to (1,5)\n\nTurn 34: from (1,5) move to (1,4)? But (1,4) is not (1,3).\n\nTo reach (1,3), from (1,5) we need to go down to (1,4) then (1,3).\n\nBut on turn 34, we can move to (1,4), but (1,3) is at (1,3), so we need to be at (1,4) or (2,3) or (1,2) to move to (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 34, we can move D to (1,4), then on turn 35 to (1,3), but turn 35 is too late, (1,3) disappears after turn 34.\n\nAfter turn 34, life span 0.\n\nSo to eat on turn 34, we need to move onto (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nSo we need to be at a cell adjacent to (1,3) on turn 33.\n\n(1,3) adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (0,3) but x=0 wall, so (1,2), (1,4), (2,3).\n\nSo on turn 33, we need to be at one of these to move to (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nNow, from our position on turn 30: at (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: we can move to (3,5) or (4,4)\n\nTo reach (1,3) by turn 34, we need to cover the distance.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,3): Δx=3, Δy=2, so min 5 moves, but we have turns 31,32,33 to position, then turn 34 to eat.\n\nTurn 31,32,33,34: 4 moves.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,3) is |4-1| + |5-3| = 3+2=5 cells, so min 5 moves needed.\n\nBut we start moving on turn 31 from (4,5).\n\nAfter turn 30, head at (4,5).\n\nTurn 31: move to, say, (3,5) or (4,4)\n\nIf move to (3,5) on turn 31.\n\nTurn 32: from (3,5) move to (2,5) or (3,4)\n\nIf move to (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33: from (2,5) move to (1,5) or (2,4)\n\nIf move to (1,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen on turn 33, at (1,5), which is adjacent to (1,4) but not directly to (1,3). From (1,5) to (1,3) is two steps: to (1,4) then (1,3).\n\nBut on turn 34, we can move to (1,4), not to (1,3) directly.\n\n(1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3), but turn 34 move to (1,4), then (1,3) on turn 35, too late.\n\nOn turn 33, if we are at (1,4), we can move to (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nBut from above, on turn 33 we are at (1,5), not (1,4).\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 33, we can move down to (2,4) or left to (1,5).\n\nIf on turn 32 at (2,5), we move down to (2,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen on turn 33 at (2,4), which is not adjacent to (1,3); adjacent are (2,3), (2,5), (1,4), (3,4).\n\n(2,4) to (1,3) not adjacent.\n\nThen on turn 34, from (2,4) move to (1,4) or (2,3), then to (1,3) on turn 35, late.\n\nTo be at a cell adjacent to (1,3) on turn 33.\n\nFor example, on turn 33 at (1,4) or (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,5) in 3 moves: turn 31,32,33.\n\nPossible: for example, turn 31: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: move to (3,4) or (2,5)\n\nIf move to (3,4) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,4) move to (2,4) or (3,3) or (3,5), but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\n(3,3) was tail earlier, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nIn current positions, after turn 30, at (4,5), positions include (3,1), etc., but (3,3) is free now? After turn 30, positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] so (3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) free.\n\nSo turn 31: from (4,5) move to (3,5) or (4,4)\n\nSay move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: from (3,5) move to (3,4) or (2,5)\n\nIf move to (3,4) on turn 32.\n\nThen turn 33: from (3,4) move to (2,4) or (3,3) or (3,5), etc.\n\nTo reach adjacent to (1,3), say (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent, diagonal.\n\nMove to (2,4) or (3,3).\n\nIf move to (2,4) on turn 33.\n\nThen (2,4) is not adjacent to (1,3); need to go to (1,4) or (2,3).\n\nThen turn 34 from (2,4) move to (2,3) or (1,4), then to (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nStill late.\n\nIf on turn 32 from (3,5) move to (2,5) instead.\n\nTurn 32 at (2,5)\n\nTurn 33 move to (1,5) or (2,4)\n\nIf to (1,5), not adjacent to (1,3).\n\nIf to (2,4), same as above.\n\nNot reaching adjacent on turn 33.\n\nFrom (4,5) directly down and left.\n\nTurn 31: move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 32: move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nTurn 32 at (3,4)\n\nThen turn 33 to (2,4) or (3,3)\n\nNot adjacent to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at y=3, so we need to be at y=3 or 2 or 4.\n\nBut min distance: from (4,5) to (1,3) is 5 steps, we have 4 moves: turn 31,32,33,34.\n\nTurn 34 we move to (1,3) to eat, so we need to be at a neighbor on turn 33.\n\nSo from turn 30 at (4,5), in 3 moves to a neighbor of (1,3).\n\nNeighbors: (1,2), (1,4), (2,3)\n\n(1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3)\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,3): |4-2| + |5-3| = 2+2=4 moves? (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,3) or something, 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (1,4): (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5) to (1,4), 4 moves.\n\nBut we only have 3 moves to reach on turn 33: from turn 31,32,33.\n\nAfter turn 30, we are at (4,5) at the end of turn 30.\n\nTurn 31: move to new cell\n\nTurn 32: move\n\nTurn 33: move to neighbor of (1,3)\n\nSo 3 moves to reach a cell adjacent to (1,3).\n\nDistance from (4,5) to (2,3) is |4-2| + |5-3| = 2+2=4, so min 4 moves, but we have only 3, so impossible to reach (2,3) in 3 moves from (4,5).\n\nSimilarly to (1,4): |4-1| + |5-4| =3+1=4 moves min.\n\nTo (1,2): |4-1| + |5-2| =3+3=6, worse.\n\nSo we cannot reach a neighbor of (1,3) by turn 33 from (4,5) in 3 moves because min distance 4 cells.\n\nTherefore, we cannot eat (1,3) by turn 34 if we go to (4,5) on turn 30.\n\nBut we have to eat (4,6) first, which delays us.\n\nIf we don't eat (4,6), we can go directly to (1,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 28, instead of moving U, move L to (4,5), but earlier we saw that moving to (4,5) then to (4,6) causes problem, but we don't have to go to (4,6).\n\nMove L to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (4,5), instead of U, we can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4) to head to (1,3).\n\nFor example, turn 28 move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29 move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30 move to (3,4) or (2,5)\n\nTurn 31 move to (2,4) or (2,5) etc.\n\nThen we can reach (1,3) in time.\n\nLife span 7, so we have until turn 34 to eat.\n\nFrom turn 28 at (5,5), move L to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nTurn 29 move L to (3,5) on turn 29.\n\nTurn 30 move L to (2,5) on turn 30.\n\nTurn 31 move L to (1,5) on turn 31.\n\nTurn 32 move D to (1,4) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33 move D to (1,3) on turn 33? But (1,3) is food, so eat on turn 33, which is within life span.\n\nLife span at turn 28:7, turn 29:6, turn 30:5, turn 31:4, turn 32:3, turn 33:2, so on turn 33, life span 2, we can eat.\n\nThen on turn 34 it decreases to 1, but we eat on turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, we can eat earlier.\n\nBut we missed (4,6) food.\n\n(4,6) has life span 10, so we can eat it later after (1,3).\n\nBut snake might be in different position.\n\nTo maximize score, eating both is better.\n\nBut with the delay from eating (4,6), we might not reach (1,3) in time.\n\nIn the first plan, with eating (4,6), we are at (4,5) on turn 30, and from there, in 3 moves (turn 31,32,33) we can reach only to, say, (1,5) or (2,4), not to (1,3) or adjacent by turn 33 to eat on turn 34.\n\nTurn 34 eat, so need to be adjacent on turn 33.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,3) is 4 moves, so on turn 33 we can be at (2,3) if we move directly.\n\nFor example, turn 31: from (4,5) move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nIf move D to (4,4) on turn 31.\n\nTurn 32: from (4,4) move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3)\n\nIf move L to (3,4) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,4) move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo (2,3), not directly.\n\nMove to (3,3) on turn 33.\n\nThen (3,3) is not adjacent to (1,3); adjacent are (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (1,3) not adjacent.\n\nThen turn 34 from (3,3) move to (2,3) or (3,2), then to (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nLate.\n\nIf from (3,4) move L to (2,4) on turn 33, then turn 34 to (2,3) or (1,4), not to (1,3).\n\nSo indeed, from (4,5) on turn 30, we cannot reach a position to eat (1,3) by turn 34.\n\nBut turn 34 is the last chance, so we must be on a neighbor on turn 33 to move to (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nSince we can't reach from (4,5) in 3 moves, we must not eat (4,6) first, or find a faster way.\n\nIf we don't eat (4,6) on turn 29, we can go directly to (1,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 28 move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29 move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30 move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31 move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 32 move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33 move D to (1,3) and eat.\n\nOn turn 33, we eat (1,3), which is fine.\n\nThen (4,6) is still there with life span 10, so we can go back to eat it later.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), snake grows, then we can head to (4,6).\n\nFor example, from (1,3), we can move to (1,2) or (2,3), then to right and up.\n\nBut there might be time.\n\nSo this way, we get both foods.\n\nIf we eat (4,6) first, we might miss (1,3), so better to go for (1,3) first since it has shorter life span.\n\nPrioritize food with shorter life span.\n\n(1,3) life span 7, (4,6) life span 10, so (1,3) should be eaten first.\n\nTherefore, for turn 28, move L to (4,5) to start heading left.\n\nThen subsequent moves to go to (1,3).\n\nBut on turn 28, moving L to (4,5) is good for that.\n\nMove U or R would take us away.\n\nMove R to (6,5) is worse for reaching (1,3).\n\nSo move L to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen turn 29, from (4,5) move L to (3,5) (since we want to go left, and U to (4,6) we avoid for now).\n\nFrom (4,5), we can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4), but to go to (1,3), moving L is better.\n\nMove L to (3,5) on turn 29.\n\nThen turn 30, from (3,5) move L to (2,5) or D to (3,4), but L to (2,5) is direct.\n\nMove L to (2,5) on turn 30.\n\nTurn 31, from (2,5) move L to (1,5) on turn 31.\n\nTurn 32, from (1,5) move D to (1,4) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33, from (1,4) move D to (1,3) and eat on turn 33.\n\nThen we have (4,6) with life span 10 at turn 28, after turn 33, it's turn 33, life span was 10, decreased by 5 turns (t28 to t32), so at turn 33, life span 10-5=5? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 28, (4,6) life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 28, life span 9 (for turn 29)\n\nAfter turn 29, life span 8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 32, life span 10 - 5 = 5? From turn 28 to turn 32: turn 28,29,30,31,32: 5 turns, life span decreases by 5, so at start of turn 33, life span is 10 - 5 = 5, so still 5 turns left, plenty of time.\n\nAfter eating (1,3) on turn 33, we can go to (4,6).\n\nBut snake is longer now, 10 segments after eating (1,3).\n\nBut we can navigate.\n\nSo for the actions, we can specify up to turn 33 or so.\n\nBut for the answer, since it starts from turn 28, we can give a sequence.\n\nNow, back to turn 28, move L to (4,5).\n\nBut we need to confirm if (4,5) is safe.\n\nOn turn 28, moving L to (4,5), from (5,5) with direction U, moving L is allowed.\n\n(4,5) is free, as established.\n\nThen turn 29, from (4,5) move L to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut on turn 29, from (4,5), we could move U to (4,6) to eat, but we decided not to, to prioritize (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, it's fine.\n\nFor the answer, I think:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nThen Turn 29: L (to (3,5))\n\nBut from (4,5), moving L to (3,5), head direction after turn 28 is L, so moving L again is forward, not reverse.\n\nThen Turn 30: L (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 31: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 33: D (to (1,3)) eat\n\nThen later to (4,6).\n\nBut for the boxed answer, perhaps we don't need all, but since the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" we can provide a sequence.\n\nTo be precise, for turn 28, move L.\n\nThen the next moves can be inferred or specified.\n\nBut I think for now, since the state is given, we can start.\n\nAlso, in the move to (1,5), (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, not wall, free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 28 is best to go for (1,3) first.\n\nThen after eating, we can plan for (4,6).\n\nBut for the answer, we can provide actions for turn 28 to, say, turn 31 or so.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for immediate.\n\nPerhaps for turn 28: L\n\nIn the initial consideration, moving U to eat (4,6) might risk missing (1,3), so better to go for the shorter life food.\n\nSo final decision: turn 28 move L.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the food at (1,3) due to its shorter remaining life span (7 turns, including turn 28). This food will disappear after turn 34, so it must be eaten by then. The food at (4,6) has a longer life span (10 turns) and can be targeted after securing (1,3). Moving left (L) on turn 28 positions the snake to efficiently reach (1,3) while avoiding the risk of getting trapped near (4,6) and missing the time-sensitive food.\n\n### Plan Details:\n- **Turn 28 (Current State)**: Move left (L) to (4,5). This avoids the reverse move (down is invalid) and starts the path toward (1,3). No food is eaten, so the snake length remains 9, and the tail moves.\n- **Turn 29**: Move left (L) to (3,5). This continues the leftward path. No food eaten; snake length 9, tail moves.\n- **Turn 30**: Move left (L) to (2,5). The snake is now closer to (1,3). No food eaten; snake length 9, tail moves.\n- **Turn 31**: Move left (L) to (1,5). This positions the snake to descend toward (1,3). No food eaten; snake length 9, tail moves.\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (1,4). This approaches (1,3) from above. No food eaten; snake length 9, tail moves.\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (1,3) and eat the food. Snake grows to length 10. The food at (1,3) is eaten just before its life span expires (life span 2 remaining at turn 33).\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving up (U) on turn 28 to eat (4,6) would risk trapping the snake near the wall at (3,6) and the border, potentially missing (1,3) due to insufficient time (from (4,5) on turn 30, it takes at least 4 moves to reach a cell adjacent to (1,3), but only 3 moves are available by turn 33). This sequence avoids that dead end.\n- **Efficiency**: The path to (1,3) is direct, using 5 moves (turns 28-32) to position and 1 move (turn 33) to eat, well within the 7-turn life span.\n- **Long-Term**: After eating (1,3), the snake can target (4,6) (life span 5+ turns remaining at turn 33) by heading right and up, with ample space to maneuver. Moving right (R) on turn 28 would delay both foods and increase risk near the border.\n\n### Actions for Turns 28 to 33:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 29: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 30: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 31: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 32: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 33: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 29, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) is probably the bottom-left or top-left? I should assume coordinates: let's say (0,0) is bottom-left, with x increasing right and y increasing up, based on the directions. Head direction is L, which is left, so decreasing x.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). So let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,2)\n\nTail is (3,2). Head direction is L, meaning it's moving left, so from (4,5) to... previous move was to (4,5) from where? Since direction is L, and positions show head at (4,5) with previous segment at (5,5), so yes, it was moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) on this turn or last turn? Current turn is 29, and we're about to make a move for turn 29? Let's see the input.\n\n\"Current Turn: t1 = 29\" and then we need to choose action for turn 29 and future turns. But in the state, it has snake positions including head at (4,5) with direction L, so on turn 29, the snake is at these positions, and we choose the next move.\n\nTypically, the positions are given for the start of turn 29, before any move. So head is at (4,5), direction L, meaning it just moved left to (4,5) or is about to move? I think it's the current position at the beginning of turn 29.\n\nThen, we choose an action for turn 29: move U, D, L, R from current head position.\n\nBut no instant reverse: since current direction is L, we cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5): U, D, L, R, but L is current direction, so moving L would continue left to (3,5)? Let's see the grid.\n\nGrid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nAlso, food: two pieces:\n\n- (1,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nLife span: for (1,3), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo on turn 29, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 29 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning:\n\n- After turn t, countdown is N\n\n- After turn t+1, countdown N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + N - 1, countdown 1\n\n- After turn t + N, it disappears, so on turn t + N, it's gone.\n\nFor food at (1,3) with life span 7 on turn 29:\n\n- Turn 29: life span 7\n\n- Turn 30: life span 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 35: life span 1\n\n- Turn 36: gone\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 9:\n\n- Turn 29: 9\n\n- Turn 30: 8\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 37: 1\n\n- Turn 38: gone\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), moving left.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: up to (4,6)\n\n- D: down to (4,4)\n\n- L: left to (3,5)\n\n- R: right to (5,5)\n\nBut R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, so moving R would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move R.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top. Assuming (0,0) bottom-left, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n\n(4,5) is x=4,y=5.\n\nU to (4,6): y=6, which is within bounds, not wall.\n\nD to (4,4): y=4, within bounds.\n\nL to (3,5): x=3,y=5, within bounds.\n\nR to (5,5): but cannot, instant reverse.\n\nAlso, need to check for collisions with body or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: no issue for (3,5), (4,6), (4,4) since all within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, so walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free, similarly y=1 to 6 free except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6.\n\nNow, (4,6) is a food position, but let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n(4,6) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is not occupied.\n\nBut food can be under body, but in this case, neither food is under snake.\n\n(4,6) is above head, (1,3) is elsewhere.\n\nNow, for each possible move, I need to think about safety and food access.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is at (3,2), and food is at (1,3) and (4,6), neither is on tail, so no issue now.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U to (4,6): this is a food position! (4,6) has food with value +1.\n\n- D to (4,4): empty? Let's see grid.\n\n- L to (3,5): empty? (3,5) not in snake positions.\n\n- R not possible.\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,6), and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nThen the food is consumed, so it disappears.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail moves, so the body changes.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (4,6) to eat the food.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6), head moves to (4,6), which has food, so I eat it, new head position (4,6), and the tail does not move? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail stays in place for this turn.\n\nSnake movement: normally, when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from its position.\n\nWhen eating food, head moves to food, new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no eat, head moves forward, tail moves forward, so the cell where tail was becomes empty.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to food, tail does not move, so snake grows by one; the new tail position is where the old tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the segment before tail becomes new something.\n\nPositions: let’s say snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eat: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where newH is new head position, and T is left, so tail was T, now new tail is the segment before T.\n\nAfter move with eat: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and T stays, so snake has one more segment; the tail remains in place.\n\nIn this case, positions: before move: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,2) tail.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6) and eat, new head (4,6), then previous head (4,5) becomes new body, and all segments shift, but tail stays? Let's index.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: tail (3,2)\n\nAfter moving U and eating: head moves to (4,6), so new position 0: (4,6), then position 1: (4,5) (previous head), position 2: (5,5) (previous 1), position 3: (5,4), ..., up to position 8: (3,2) (previous tail), and since ate, add a new segment at the end, so new position 9: (3,2), but (3,2) is already occupied by tail? No.\n\nWhen eating, the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added, but the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail stays, it's like the snake extends at the tail.\n\nStandard: after eating, the tail remains in place, so the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body..., old_tail] and old_tail is now part of body, with a new tail segment at old_tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think: the snake moves head to new cell. If it eats, the tail does not advance, so the cell that was tail remains occupied, and snake grows. If not eat, tail advances, so old tail cell is freed.\n\nPositions: let S be the list of positions.\n\nAfter move to new_head:\n\nIf no eat: S_new = [new_head] + S[:-1]  // head moves, each segment moves to previous position, last segment (tail) is removed from list? S[:-1] means all except the last, so new list is [new_head, S[0], S[1], ..., S[-2]] where S[-2] is the segment before tail.\n\nFor example, S = [A,B,C] A head, C tail.\n\nMove to new_head D, no eat: S_new = [D, A, B] so B is new tail, C is free.\n\nIf eat: S_new = [D, A, B, C] so C is still tail, and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, with eat, the tail position remains, and it becomes the new last segment.\n\nIn positions, when eat, we add the old tail position again or what?\n\nS = [A,B,C], eat: S_new = [D, A, B, C] so C is still there, but now it's not the tail? [D, A, B, C] with D head, C tail.\n\nYes, tail is C, same as before.\n\nThe cell C remains occupied.\n\nIf no eat, S_new = [D, A, B], tail B.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nCurrent S: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] so head (4,5), tail (3,2)\n\nIf move U to (4,6) and eat food there:\n\nNew head (4,6)\n\nThen new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]  // old tail (3,2) is still there, and it is now the tail? Positions: index 0: (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), ..., 8: (3,1), 9: (3,2) so tail is (3,2), same as before, but now it's part of a longer snake.\n\nThe snake has 10 segments now.\n\nIf I move to (4,6) and don't eat, but there is food, so I do eat.\n\n(4,6) has food, so moving there means I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for other moves.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U to eat the food at (4,6).\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), which is adjacent to (4,6)? (4,6) and (3,6) are different.\n\n(4,6) is food, (3,6) is obstacle, so not an issue for moving to (4,6).\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), head is at (4,6), and direction is U, since I moved up.\n\nThen for next turn, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move D.\n\nNow, the food at (4,6) is eaten, so it's gone.\n\nOther food at (1,3) with life span 7.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut first, let's see the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls on borders.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions after eating (4,6): head (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nTail is at (3,2).\n\nNow, from (4,6), possible moves:\n\nU: to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so collision, die. Cannot move U.\n\nD: to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body segment, since after move, (4,5) is the first body segment, so moving to (4,5) would collide with body. Dead.\n\nL: to (3,6), but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so collision, die.\n\nR: to (5,6), which is empty? Let's see, (5,6) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle.\n\n(5,6) x=5,y=6, within bounds, no wall, and not occupied by snake.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,6) is R to (5,6), but is that safe?\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), head at (4,6), body at (4,5), etc.\n\nIf I move R to (5,6), then new head (5,6), and since no food there (food was at (4,6) eaten), so no eat, so tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) ]\n\nAfter move R to (5,6) no eat: new positions [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ]  // tail (3,2) moved away, new tail is (3,1)? Positions: new head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), ..., up to (4,1) and (3,1), so last is (3,1), which was previously the segment before tail.\n\nOld tail was (3,2), which is now free.\n\nNew tail is (3,1).\n\nAnd head at (5,6).\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut if I go to (4,6) on turn 29, then on turn 30 I must move to (5,6) to survive, as other moves are death.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but U to (5,7) y=7 wall, die; D to (5,5) which is body, since (5,5) is in positions; L to (4,6) which is now body; R to (6,6) which might be free.\n\nPositions at turn 30 after move: [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ... ]\n\nSo (5,5) is body, (4,6) is body.\n\nFrom (5,6):\n\n- U: (5,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (5,5) is position 3 in the list? Index: head (5,6), then (4,6), then (4,5), then (5,5), so (5,5) is the fourth segment, so yes, occupied, collision if move there.\n\n- L: (4,6) is the second segment, occupied.\n\n- R: (6,6) x=6,y=6, not wall, not in positions? Positions: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (6,6), so free.\n\nSo only move R to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 31: head at (6,6), move to (6,6) no eat, positions update: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ... ] tail is (3,1) or something.\n\nBut (6,6) is on the edge, x=6, y=6.\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,7) wall, die\n\nD to (6,5) empty? (6,5) not in positions, probably free\n\nL to (5,6) which is now body, since previous head\n\nR to (7,6) but x=7 wall, die\n\nSo only D to (6,5) or L, but L to (5,6) is occupied.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), etc., so (5,6) is adjacent and occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,5), and so on.\n\nBut this seems like I'm being forced to move right and down, away from the other food at (1,3), and I might get trapped.\n\nMoreover, the snake is long, and the grid has limited space.\n\nIf I eat the food at (4,6) on turn 29, I go to (4,6), then must go to (5,6) on turn 30, then to (6,6) on turn 31, then to (6,5) on turn 32, etc.\n\nBut from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4) or R to (7,5) wall, or U to (6,6) body.\n\n(6,6) is previous head, so body.\n\nSo from (6,5), possible D to (6,4), L to (5,5), or U to (6,6) but occupied, so not U.\n\nR to (7,5) wall, no.\n\nSo D or L.\n\n(5,5) is occupied? At turn 32, after moving to (6,5), positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 29: move U to (4,6), eat, positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 30: move R to (5,6), no eat, positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] new tail (3,1), (3,2) free\n\nTurn 31: move R to (6,6), no eat, positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)? Last is (4,1)\n\nPositions: 0:(6,6), 1:(5,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(4,5), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,4), 6:(5,3), 7:(5,2), 8:(5,1), 9:(4,1) tail\n\nTurn 32: from (6,6), move D to (6,5), no eat, positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ] tail (5,1)? Last is (5,1), since (4,1) was tail, but moved away.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1)\n\n(4,1) is free now.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move:\n\n- U to (6,6) but (6,6) is now body (position 1), occupied, die\n\n- D to (6,4) empty? Not in positions, free\n\n- L to (5,5) but (5,5) is position 5 in the list? Index: 0:(6,5), 1:(6,6), 2:(5,6), 3:(4,6), 4:(4,5), 5:(5,5), so (5,5) is position 5, occupied\n\n- R to (7,5) wall, die\n\nSo only move D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 33: move to (6,4), no eat, positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] tail (5,2)\n\nAnd so on. I'm stuck in the bottom-right corner, with the body blocking, and I have to keep moving down or left, but left might be blocked by body.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), or U to (6,5) body, R wall.\n\n(5,4) is position 7? Positions: 0:(6,4), 1:(6,5), 2:(6,6), 3:(5,6), 4:(4,6), 5:(4,5), 6:(5,5), 7:(5,4), 8:(5,3), 9:(5,2) tail\n\nSo (5,4) is position 7, occupied.\n\nL to (5,4) is occupied, so only D to (6,3) or U but U to (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo D to (6,3).\n\nThen to (6,3), and so on to (6,2), (6,1), (6,0) wall, die at some point.\n\nWhen I reach y=1, I might have options, but it's messy, and I'm far from the other food at (1,3).\n\nEating the food at (4,6) leads to a dead end quickly.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (4,6) on turn 29 is bad because it forces me into a corner where I die in a few turns.\n\nSo I should not eat that food now.\n\nBut I have other options.\n\nBack to turn 29, head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L\n\nU to (4,6) with food, but as above, dangerous.\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nL to (3,5)\n\nR not possible.\n\nNow, move D to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is empty, no food, so no eat.\n\nThen after move, positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] and tail moves, old tail (3,2) is free, new tail is (3,1)? Positions: head to (4,4), then old head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) so tail (3,1)\n\n(3,2) was tail, now free.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nFood at (1,3) and (4,6), but (4,6) is still there.\n\n(4,6) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while.\n\nMove L to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is empty, no food, so no eat.\n\nAfter move: [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)? Last is (3,1), but (3,1) is occupied, and (3,2) free.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nNow, (3,5) is just below the obstacle at (3,6).\n\nFrom here, I can move to access the food at (1,3) or other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,6). If I don't eat it now, it might be available later, or I can avoid it.\n\nBut eating it is risky, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it later from a different approach.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,5), then I can move U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\nU: to (3,6) obstacle, invalid\n\nD: to (3,4) empty? Not in positions, free\n\nL: to (2,5) empty\n\nR: to (4,5) but (4,5) is now body, since it was previous head? Positions: head (3,5), then (4,5) is first body segment, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n\nAlso, current direction is L, so moving R is instant reverse? Current direction after move to (3,5) is L, so moving R to (4,5) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 29, if I move L to (3,5), direction becomes L.\n\nThen on turn 30, from (3,5), cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U invalid, D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R not allowed.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D on turn 29 to (4,4), then from there.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (1,3). It has life span 7, so it will disappear on turn 36 (since turn 29:7, 30:6, ..., 35:1, 36 gone).\n\nI need to reach it before turn 36.\n\nCurrent position (4,5) to (1,3) is distance |4-1| + |5-3| = 3+2=5, so at least 5 turns away, but with the snake body, it might take more.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (1,5), then down to (1,4), then to (1,3), that's 4 moves, but from (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3), but need to see if the path is clear.\n\nBut at (1,5), I might be able to go directly to (1,3) but not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\n(1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) has food.\n\nSimilarly, I could go through other paths.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nCurrent snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to see the free space.\n\nOccupied: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nWalls: borders and (3,6)\n\nFood: (1,3), (4,6)\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,0) to (7,7) except walls and occupied.\n\nBut walls are borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) except obstacles and snake.\n\nInternal obstacle only (3,6).\n\nSo free cells: all except snake positions and (3,6).\n\nFor instance, (1,3) is free, (4,6) free, etc.\n\nNow, to reach (1,3) from (4,5), I can go left and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5) on turn 29.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 30, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\nIf I want to go to (1,3), moving L to (2,5) is better.\n\nMove L to (2,5), no food, positions: [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) ] and tail (3,1) or something.\n\nPrevious positions before move turn 30: at start of turn 30, head at (3,5) after turn 29 move.\n\nAfter turn 29 move L to (3,5): positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nTurn 30 move L to (2,5): no eat, new positions [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) ] tail (4,1)? Last is (4,1), (3,1) free.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 31, move L to (1,5), no eat, positions [ (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ] tail (5,1)\n\nHead at (1,5), direction L.\n\nNow, from (1,5), I need to go down to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nBut (1,3) is two steps down.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n\nD to (1,4)\n\nU to (1,6) but y=6, not wall, y=7 is wall, y=6 ok.\n\nBut U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), or L to (0,5) x=0 wall, die, or R to (2,5) body.\n\nCurrent direction L, so moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), no food, positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] tail (5,2)\n\nThen turn 32, from (1,4), move D to (1,3), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew positions: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] tail (5,2) but since eat, tail doesn't move, so new tail is (5,2), and snake grows.\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen from here, I can move to other areas.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is still there, life span 9, so after turn 38 it disappears.\n\nBut I have time.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), I am at (1,3), with the snake extending to the left.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3): U, D, L, R, but L to (0,3) wall, die; R to (2,3) empty? Not in positions; D to (1,2) empty; U to (1,4) but (1,4) is now body, since after eating, positions include (1,4) as second segment.\n\nPositions: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ... ] so (1,4) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction D, so moving U is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) might be free.\n\nMove D to (1,2): no food, then to (1,1), etc., but y=0 wall.\n\nMove R to (2,3): better.\n\nThen I can explore the grid.\n\nBut let's see if this path is safe.\n\nOn turn 29, if I move L to (3,5), I can reach (1,3) by turn 32, as above: turn 29 L to (3,5), turn 30 L to (2,5), turn 31 L to (1,5), turn 32 D to (1,4)? In my earlier, turn 31 at (1,5), move D to (1,4) turn 32, then D to (1,3) turn 33.\n\nTurn 29: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move to (1,5)\n\nNow at (1,5), need to go down to (1,3).\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,4)  // no food\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,3)  // eat food\n\nYes.\n\nAnd (1,3) food has life span 7 on turn 29, so on turn 33, how many turns left?\n\nTurn 29: life span 7\n\nAfter turn 29, countdown 6? Let's clarify life span.\n\nFood at (1,3) on turn 29: life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns from now, so on turn 36 it disappears.\n\nTurn 29: present, life span 7\n\nAfter turn 29 executed, life span 6\n\nAfter turn 30, life span 5\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 35 executed, life span 1\n\nAfter turn 36 executed, it disappears, so on turn 36, it's not there.\n\nSo to eat it, I need to be on the cell on or before turn 35.\n\nOn turn 35, if I move to it, I eat it when life span is 1, before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 29, life span 7, I can eat on turn 29 to 35 inclusive? When I move to the cell on turn t, I eat it if present.\n\nIf I move to (1,3) on turn 33, life span at start of turn 33: turn 29:7, 30:6, 31:5, 32:4, turn 33:3, so yes, still there.\n\nIf I move on turn 35, life span 1, eat, then gone.\n\nIf on turn 36, gone, cannot eat.\n\nSo I can eat by turn 35.\n\nTurn 33 is fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 29, if I move L to (3,5), I can eat (1,3) on turn 33.\n\nWhat about the other food at (4,6)? I can get it later if possible.\n\nBut after eating (1,3), I am at (1,3), and the snake is long, so I need to find a way out.\n\nFrom (1,3), after eating, head at (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) and since ate, tail stays, so positions include (5,2) as tail.\n\nThen I can move, for example, R to (2,3) if possible.\n\n(2,3) should be free.\n\nMove R to (2,3), no food, then I can go up or down.\n\nBut the food at (4,6) is at (4,6), which is above.\n\nI can navigate towards it.\n\nBut life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nAnother option: on turn 29, I could move D to (4,4) instead.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go left or down to reach (1,3), but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), move L to (3,4), then to (2,4), etc., but to (1,3), need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (1,3): |4-1| + |4-3| = 3+1=4, similar distance.\n\nBut with the body, it might be blocked or not.\n\nMoving to (4,4) might not be efficient for reaching (1,3).\n\nMoreover, moving L directly seems better.\n\nBut let's consider if I can avoid the food at (4,6) or eat it safely.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (4,6) from below.\n\nFor example, if I move to (4,4) on turn 29, then to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, cannot.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ... ] so (4,5) occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) but body, die; D to (4,3); L to (3,4); R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body? Positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4) is later? Current positions after move to (4,4): [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nSo (5,4) is position 3, occupied.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,5) occupied, die\n\n- D to (4,3) free\n\n- L to (3,4) free\n\n- R to (5,4) occupied, die\n\nAnd current direction D, so moving U is instant reverse? After moving to (4,4), direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf move D to (4,3), or L to (3,4).\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), then I can go to (2,4), etc., towards (1,3).\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nMoving directly L from (4,5) to (3,5) seems more direct for (1,3).\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not an issue now.\n\nAnother thing: if I move to (3,5) on turn 29, and the obstacle at (3,6) is above, so I cannot go up from there, but I can go left or down.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4), for example.\n\nBut to reach (1,3), better to go left first.\n\nPerhaps I should plan the sequence.\n\nSince the snake is long, and the grid is small, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nThe area around (1,3) might have space.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3), I can move right or down.\n\n(1,2), (1,1), etc., but y=0 wall.\n\n(2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) might be free.\n\nIn current state, (3,3) is not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free.\n\nSo from (1,3), after eating, move R to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nThen I can go up to (3,4), (3,5) but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nBy turn 33, positions change.\n\nBut I think it's manageable.\n\nNow, the food at (4,6): I can try to eat it later, but need to approach from the side, not from below, because if I go to (4,5) and then U, but (4,5) might be body.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3), if I go to (2,3), (3,3), then to (3,4), (4,4), etc., then to (4,5) might be clear later.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nFor turn 29, moving L to (3,5) seems good to target (1,3).\n\nIf I move U to eat (4,6), it's dangerous as I saw earlier.\n\nSo I should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, for turn 29, action should be L.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn 29, 30, 31, etc., up to 5+ turns.\n\nBut I don't know how many; I think I need to simulate.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the sequence starting from turn 29.\n\nPerhaps I can output a few turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (3,5)  // from (4,5)\n\nThen turn 30: from (3,5), move L to (2,5)  // towards (1,5)\n\nTurn 31: from (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 32: from (1,5), move D to (1,4)  // down towards (1,3)\n\nTurn 33: from (1,4), move D to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nNow, on turn 33, I eat (1,3), head at (1,3), and snake grows.\n\nThen from there, I need to move, say, R to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to turn 29 to, say, turn 33 or so.\n\nSince the food at (4,6) is still there, I might go for it later, but not immediately.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 29 I move L, but what about the direction? Current direction was L, I move L, so direction remains L.\n\nThen turn 30 move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 31 move L to (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 32 move D to (1,4), now direction changes to D.\n\nThen turn 33 move D to (1,3), direction D.\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue, but for the answer, I can stop after a few turns.\n\nThe core is to maximize score and survive long-term.\n\nBy eating (1,3) I get +1, and avoid the risk of (4,6).\n\nIf I don't eat (1,3), it disappears on turn 36, so I should eat it.\n\n(4,6) I can eat later if possible.\n\nBut for now, the sequence above seems safe.\n\nAnother option: perhaps on turn 29, I move D to (4,4), then go left from there, but it might take longer to reach (1,3).\n\nFor example, turn 29 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 30 move L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31 move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32 move L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33 move D to (1,3) to eat, same as before, but I started from lower y.\n\nIn this case, from (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,3), that's 4 moves, turn 29 to 33, same as previous.\n\nBut in previous, from (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3), that's 5 moves? Turn 29 to (3,5), 30 to (2,5), 31 to (1,5), 32 to (1,4), 33 to (1,3), so turn 33 eat.\n\nSimilarly, if start from (4,4): turn 29 to (4,4), 30 to (3,4), 31 to (2,4), 32 to (1,4), 33 to (1,3), also turn 33 eat.\n\nBut in the first path, when I go to (1,5) on turn 31, then down, I might have more options, but both similar.\n\nHowever, in the first path, by moving L directly, I stay at y=5, which might be better for accessing other areas later.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nNow, about the food at (4,6): if I don't eat it on turn 29, it's still there, and I can eat it after going to (1,3).\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3) on turn 33, head at (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), then U to (2,4), etc., towards (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) life span 9, on turn 29, so on turn 33, life span: 29:9,30:8,31:7,32:6,33:5, so still 5 turns left, I can reach it.\n\nFor instance, from (1,3) to (4,6): |1-4| + |3-6| = 3+3=6, so about 6 turns, but with body, might take more, but life span 5 on turn 33, so on turn 38 it disappears, I need to eat by turn 38.\n\nTurn 33: life span 5, so after turn 33, 4 left, etc., disappear on turn 38.\n\nIf I start from (1,3) on turn 33, I can go to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), then to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but (4,5) might be occupied.\n\nIn turn 33, after eating (1,3), positions include (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc., so (4,5) is occupied at that time.\n\nIn the sequence: when I eat (1,3) on turn 33, positions: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) ] since grew, tail (5,2)\n\n(4,5) is occupied.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (4,5) from (4,4) or something.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) move R to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (4,4), but (4,4) might be free, then to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, so cannot.\n\n(4,5) is body, so I need to wait for it to move or go to (3,4) then (4,4), etc.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go up to (4,4), then if (4,5) is occupied, I can go to (5,4) or something, but messy.\n\nPerhaps I should not worry about (4,6) for now; focus on eating (1,3) safely.\n\nSince eating (4,6) is risky, and I can survive without it.\n\nBut it's positive food, so if possible, eat it.\n\nBut in the initial move to (4,6) is bad, so avoid.\n\nFor turn 29, best to move L to (3,5).\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nI think outputting up to turn 33 is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, need to consider if moving to (3,5) is safe.\n\nOn turn 29, move L to (3,5): (3,5) is free, not wall, not body, so safe.\n\nThen from there, as above.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: L (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 31: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 33: D (to (1,3) and eat)\n\nThen I can stop or continue, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 29 to 33 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 29,30,31,32,33: that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 32: move D to (1,4), which is empty, no issue.\n\nThen turn 33: move D to (1,3), eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nI could have gone directly from (1,5) to (1,3) but not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must avoid the immediate risk of moving up to (4,6) to eat the positive food there, as this leads to a dead end in the top-right corner within a few turns. Instead, the AI should prioritize eating the positive food at (1,3) first, as it has a shorter life span (disappears after turn 36) and is safer to reach. The path to (1,3) involves moving left from the current head position at (4,5) to (3,5), then continuing left to (2,5) and (1,5), then down to (1,4) and (1,3) to eat the food on turn 33. This sequence is safe, avoids collisions, and allows the snake to survive beyond the immediate turns. The food at (4,6) can be considered later if possible, but it is not urgent due to its longer life span (disappears after turn 38).\n\n**Planned Actions (5 turns ahead for turns 29 to 33):**\n- **Turn 29**: Move L (left) to (3,5). This avoids the risky move to (4,6) and starts the path toward (1,3). The current direction is L, so moving L is allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Turn 30**: Move L (left) to (2,5). This continues the path left toward (1,5), and the direction remains L.\n- **Turn 31**: Move L (left) to (1,5). This reaches the x=1 row, setting up the descent to (1,3). Direction remains L.\n- **Turn 32**: Move D (down) to (1,4). This moves down toward (1,3); (1,4) is free, and changing direction to D is allowed (no instant reverse from L, as the previous move was L).\n- **Turn 33**: Move D (down) to (1,3) to eat the positive food. The food is eaten, increasing the snake length by 1, and the direction is now D.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the +1 food at (1,3) before it disappears, with no collision risks. After turn 33, the snake can navigate to other areas (e.g., moving right to (2,3)) to potentially eat the food at (4,6) or explore safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: L \\\\\nTurn 30: L \\\\\nTurn 31: L \\\\\nTurn 32: D \\\\\nTurn 33: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 30. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (3,5) from (4,5), I assume.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- One at (1,3) with value 1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 30, this food will disappear after 6 turns, so at turn 36.\n\n- Another at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8, so disappears at turn 38.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. Also, avoid risks like collisions or getting trapped.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small map.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, but walls are at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? Let's clarify.\n\nCells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is a wall.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (3,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom and left, with a vertical part from (5,1) to (5,5), and head at (3,5) moving left.\n\nHead direction is L, so from (4,5) to (3,5), so it just moved left to (3,5).\n\nNow possible moves from current position (3,5):\n\n- Up: to (3,6) but (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Down: to (3,4)\n\n- Left: to (2,5)\n\n- Right: to (4,5) but (4,5) is the first body segment. But according to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed because the tail will move, but (4,5) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head. Let's see the positions: positions are [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ...] so (4,5) is the neck, part of the body.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but if it's a body segment that won't move, it's collision.\n\nIn this case, from (3,5), moving right to (4,5): (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake body, and since we move, the body will shift, but at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides unless it's the tail cell that is moving away.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. So if head moves to a cell that is part of the body except the tail, it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n\nSpecifically, after move, the new head position is set, then if no food, tail is removed. So during the move, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail (which will be removed), it's a collision.\n\nIn this case, positions: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: (4,5), index 2: (5,5), ..., index 8: tail (3,1)\n\nIf head moves to (4,5), which is index 1, that's a body segment not the tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any occupied cell except the tail is collision.\n\nTail is (3,1), far away.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,6) - wall, invalid.\n\n- Down: (3,4) - let's check if occupied. Current positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So (3,4) is not in this list, so empty? y=4, x=3, not listed, so free.\n\n- Left: (2,5) - x=2, y=5, not in positions, so free.\n\n- Right: (4,5) - occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n\nAlso, walls: (2,5) is x=2, y=5, x from 1 to 6 should be free, since walls only at borders and (3,6). Borders x=0,7 y=0,7. (2,5) x=2>0,<7, y=5>0,<7, not (3,6), so ok.\n\nSimilarly (3,4) ok.\n\nSo valid moves from current: Down to (3,4) or Left to (2,5).\n\nNow, food: (1,3) and (4,6)\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6. But y=6, and walls at y=7, but y=6 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. But (4,6) is food position.\n\nSimilarly (1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the current state clearly:\n\n- Head at (3,5), direction left.\n\n- Food: (1,3) with life span 6, so disappears at turn 36. Current turn 30, so 6 turns left including turn 30? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 30, life span 6, after turn 30, it becomes 5, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (4,6), life span 8, from turn 30 to turn 37? Let's calculate:\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for L more turns, including the current turn if we act on it.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" for turn t=30.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (1,3): life span 6 at turn 30, so at turn 31, life span 5, ..., at turn 35, life span 1, at turn 36, it disappears (life span 0).\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life span 8 at turn 30, disappears at turn 38.\n\nNow, both foods are +1, positive.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to food safely.\n\nAlso, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it might be dangerous if it causes collision.\n\nBut tail is at (3,1), head is at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) and (3,1) are 4 cells apart, not adjacent.\n\nNow, possible immediate moves: from (3,5), can go down to (3,4) or left to (2,5).\n\nI should consider the board layout.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\ny=7: wall\n\ny=6: cells (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) wall (4,6) food (5,6) (6,6)\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\ny=5: (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) head (4,5) body (5,5) body (6,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) body (6,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3) food (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) body (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2) body (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) tail (4,1) body (5,1) body (6,1)\n\ny=0: wall\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nSo playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (3,6) blocked.\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nSo the snake has a \"tail\" at (3,1), and it's like a U-shape or something.\n\nFrom head (3,5), if I go down to (3,4), that's free. Then from there, I can go down to (3,3), left to (2,4), or right to (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I go left to (2,5), free, then from (2,5) I can go up to (2,6), down to (2,4), left to (1,5), or right to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body? After move.\n\nI need to simulate moves.\n\nAlso, food at (1,3) and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which is top row, and (3,6) is wall, so (4,6) is accessible only from below or sides, but sides: (3,6) wall, (5,6) is free, I think.\n\n(4,6): adjacent cells: up (4,7) wall, down (4,5) which is occupied by snake body, left (3,6) wall, right (5,6).\n\nSo from (4,6), only accessible from (5,6) or from below if (4,5) is free.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied now.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3): adjacent cells: up (1,4), down (1,2), left (0,3) wall, right (2,3).\n\nAll free except walls.\n\nNow, to eat (1,3), I need to get to (1,3) with head.\n\nSimilarly for (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) has shorter life? No, (1,3) life 6, disappears turn 36; (4,6) life 8, disappears later.\n\nBut both are +1, so equally good, but I should go for the one that is safer or easier to get to.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need space to move without colliding.\n\nCurrent snake length 9, so after eating, length 10.\n\nNow, from current position, if I go left to (2,5), that gets me closer to (1,3).\n\nIf I go down to (3,4), that might lead to other areas.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThe board has the snake body blocking the bottom left area, so I might be able to go around.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,1), which might move when I don't eat food, so paths can open up.\n\nI need to plan a path to food or to safety.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,5) at turn 30.\n\nThen snake moves: head to (2,5), body follows, so new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) is removed since no food eaten? When no food, tail is removed.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), the snake positions become: head at (2,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes body, and so on, up to the segment before tail, and tail (3,1) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]  length 9, tail is (4,1).\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0:(3,5), 1:(4,5), 2:(5,5), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,3), 5:(5,2), 6:(5,1), 7:(4,1), 8:(3,1)\n\nAfter moving left to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body: previous head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) is removed. So positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]  tail at (4,1).\n\nNow, from (2,5), possible moves: up to (2,6), down to (2,4), left to (1,5), right to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, so cannot, collision.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body, so cannot move right.\n\nUp (2,6): is it free? (2,6) not occupied, and not wall, y=6<7, x=2>0, not obstacle, so free.\n\nDown (2,4): not occupied, free.\n\nLeft (1,5): not occupied, and x=1>0, not wall.\n\nSo from (2,5), can go U, D, or L.\n\nNow, food at (1,3), which is down and left.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down first to (3,4).\n\nBack to turn 30.\n\nAnother option: move down to (3,4) at turn 30.\n\nThen positions: head to (3,4), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) removed, so positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] tail at (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: up to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision; down to (3,3); left to (2,4); right to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) free? y=3,x=3, not occupied, free.\n\n(2,4) free.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nSo U invalid, D, L, R valid.\n\nNow, to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nI need to consider getting to food.\n\nFirst, let's consider going for (1,3) food.\n\n(1,3) is at left bottom, and tail is moving.\n\nFrom current (3,5), if I go left to (2,5), then I can go down or left or up.\n\nIf I go left to (1,5), then from (1,5) I can go down to (1,4), then to (1,3) to eat.\n\nBut need to see if it's safe.\n\nAlso, life span: (1,3) has 6 turns, so I can reach it in a few moves.\n\nDistance: from (3,5) to (1,3) is Δx=2 left, Δy=2 down, so Manhattan distance 4, but with body, might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is closer in some way? (4,6) from (3,5): Δx=1, Δy=1, but (4,5) is occupied, so cannot go directly.\n\nFrom (3,5), to (4,6) is not adjacent, since (3,6) wall.\n\nAccess to (4,6) is only from (4,5) or (5,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) wall, (4,5) occupied, so only from (5,6).\n\n(4,6) adjacent: (4,5), (5,6), (3,6) wall, (4,7) wall.\n\nSo only (4,5) and (5,6) are possible access points.\n\n(4,5) is occupied by snake, so currently not accessible.\n\n(5,6) is free, I think.\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6, not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo to get to (4,6), I need to go to (5,6) first, then left to (4,6).\n\nFrom current position, how to get to (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go down to (3,4), then I can go right to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, the board has the snake body in the bottom, so the upper part is more open.\n\nFor example, cells above y=4 are relatively free.\n\ny=6 has (4,6) food, and (5,6) free, (6,6) free, etc.\n\ny=5 has snake at (3,5),(4,5),(5,5), so blocked.\n\nAfter moving, things change.\n\nLet's simulate both options for a few turns.\n\nFirst, suppose at turn 30, I move left to (2,5).\n\nThen positions as above: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nFood: (1,3) life 5 now? Turn 30, after move, turn 31, food life decreases.\n\nAt the start of turn 30, state given, we choose action for turn 30.\n\nAfter action, turn advances to 31, food life decreases.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during move, it eats.\n\nSo for turn 30 action, if I move to food, I eat it.\n\nBut here, no food at (2,5) or (3,4), so not eating.\n\nAfter turn 30 action, turn 31 begins.\n\nNow, from (2,5) at turn 31, I can go to (1,5) to get closer to (1,3).\n\nMove left to (1,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) and tail removed? After moving to (1,5), new head (1,5), body: previous head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (4,1) is removed? Tail was (4,1), but when we add new head, the tail is removed if no food.\n\nPositions before move: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] so tail (4,1).\n\nAfter moving to (1,5): new positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and tail (4,1) removed, so positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), since up (1,6) is free, down (1,4) free, right (2,5) but occupied, left wall.\n\nSo U, D, L invalid? L to (0,5) wall, invalid. R to (2,5) body, collision. So only U or D.\n\nGo down to (1,4).\n\nThen at turn 32, move to (1,4).\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1) removed, so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] tail (5,2).\n\nFrom (1,4), I can go down to (1,3) to eat food.\n\n(1,3) is food, so if I go down, I move to (1,3), eat it, snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (1,3), body includes previous head and all, tail stays.\n\nSo positions: head to (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and since ate food, no tail removal, new segment added, so positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] length 10, tail at (5,2).\n\nNow, from here, head at (1,3), which is corner, possible moves: up to (1,4) but occupied, body; down to (1,2); left wall; right to (2,3).\n\n(1,2) free, (2,3) free? (2,3) not occupied, yes.\n\nBut (1,4) is body, so cannot go up.\n\nSo can go down to (1,2) or right to (2,3).\n\nIf I go down to (1,2), then I might get stuck in corner.\n\n(1,2) is free, then from there I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is free, I think.\n\nIn positions, (1,1) not occupied, yes.\n\nBut after growing, the snake is long, and in the bottom left, it might be cramped.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), if I go right to (2,3), then I can go up or down or right.\n\nBut let's see the board: the area around (2,3) is relatively free, but snake body is at (5,2), (5,3), etc., so bottom is occupied, but I can move up.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to think if this is safe long-term.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is still there, but I ate (1,3), so I got one food.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nIf at turn 32 I eat (1,3), that's turn 32, but life span was 6 at turn 30, so at turn 32, life span 4? Let's track food life.\n\nAt turn 30 start: (1,3) life 6\n\nAfter turn 30 action: turn 31, life decreases to 5\n\nAfter turn 31 action: turn 32, life decreases to 4\n\nIf I move to (1,3) at turn 32, I eat it, life was 4, but I eat before it decreases? When I move to it, I eat it during the move, so at the time of move, if life span >0, I eat.\n\nAt turn 32, before action, food has life span, say L, I move to it, eat, then after move, life decreases but food is gone.\n\nTypically, when head moves to food cell, it eats if food is there.\n\nIn this case, at turn 32, I move to (1,3), which has food with life span 4 (since decreased at turn 31), so I eat it.\n\nNow, back to after eating, head at (1,3), surrounded: up (1,4) body, left wall, down (1,2) free, right (2,3) free.\n\nIf I go down to (1,2), then from (1,2), I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is free, then from (1,1) I can go up to (1,2) but body, or right to (2,1), or down wall.\n\n(2,1) is free? In positions, after eating at turn 32, positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nSo (2,1) not occupied, free.\n\nBut (1,2) is not in positions, so free at that moment.\n\nAfter move to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nSo (1,2) is empty.\n\nFrom (1,3), if I go down to (1,2), then positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), and tail (5,2) removed? Since no food, tail removed.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), new head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), tail (5,2) removed, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] tail at (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2) (since left wall, up to (1,3) body).\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then from (1,1) only right to (2,1) or up to (1,2) body.\n\n(2,1) free.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, if I go there, I might get trapped if the body blocks the way.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,1), then from there only (2,1), then to (2,2), etc., but the body is at (5,3), etc., so I have space, but the snake is long, and I need to avoid colliding.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go right to (2,2), then I can go to (2,3), (3,2), etc., and the upper area is free.\n\nBut let's not get too deep; this is for the left move path.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, I have another food at (4,6) with longer life.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (1,3) at turn 32, so I have one food.\n\nNow, the other option: at turn 30, move down to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go for (4,6) or other.\n\nLet's see that path.\n\nAt turn 30, move down to (3,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), left to (2,4), or right to (4,4).\n\nSuppose I go right to (4,4) to get closer to (4,6).\n\nMove right to (4,4) at turn 31.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1) removed, so [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail (5,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: up to (4,5) but occupied, body; down to (4,3); left to (3,4) occupied; right to (5,4) but (5,4) is body? Positions: (5,4) is in body, yes, occupied.\n\n(4,5) occupied, (3,4) occupied, (5,4) occupied, so only down to (4,3) free? (4,3) not occupied, yes.\n\nSo only down move valid? That seems bad.\n\nFrom (4,4), after move, positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n\nSo cells around: up (4,5) occupied, down (4,3) free, left (3,4) occupied, right (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo only down to (4,3) is possible.\n\nMust go down to (4,3).\n\nAt turn 32, move to (4,3).\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1) removed, so [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] tail (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: up to (4,4) occupied, down to (4,2), left to (3,3), right to (5,3) but (5,3) is body.\n\n(4,4) occupied, (3,3) free? (3,3) not in positions, free.\n\n(4,2) free, (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo can go down to (4,2) or left to (3,3).\n\nSay go left to (3,3) to avoid bottom.\n\nMove to (3,3) at turn 33.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), tail (5,2) removed, so [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] tail (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moves: up to (3,4) occupied, down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo down to (3,2) or left to (2,3).\n\nBoth free.\n\nBut I'm moving away from (4,6) food.\n\nTo get to (4,6), I need to go up, but the way is blocked by snake body.\n\nFor example, (4,5) is occupied, and (3,6) wall, so to reach (4,6), I need to go to (5,6) first.\n\n(5,6) is free.\n\nBut from current positions, how to get to (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,3), if I go to (2,3), etc., it might take time.\n\nBut (4,6) has life span 8, so at turn 30, life 8, decreases to 7 at turn 31, 6 at 32, 5 at 33, etc., so by turn 37 it disappears.\n\nAt turn 33, life span 5, so I have time.\n\nBut in this path, I'm at (3,3) at turn 33, and (5,6) is far.\n\nManhattan distance from (3,3) to (5,6) is |3-5| + |3-6| = 2+3=5, but with body, it might take more turns.\n\nMoreover, the snake body is in the way.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) I can go to (4,3) but occupied, or to (3,4) occupied, so I have to go to (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nSay go to (2,3) at turn 34, then to (2,4) or (1,3), but (1,3) food might be gone or not.\n\n(1,3) life: at turn 30 life 6, turn 31:5, turn32:4, turn33:3, turn34:2, turn35:1, turn36:0 disappear.\n\nAt turn 34, if I go to (1,3), I can eat if life>0.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) if I want.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nThe point is that by moving down first, I ended up in a position where I have only one move option at some point, which is risky, and it might be harder to reach the other food.\n\nWhereas in the first path, by going left, I was able to eat (1,3) quickly at turn 32.\n\nNow, after eating (1,3), I have a long snake, but I can move to the right and up to open space.\n\nFor example, from head at (1,3) after eating, I can go right to (2,3) at turn 33.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nThe upper area like (2,6), (3,4), etc., is free.\n\n(4,6) food is still there, life span 8 at turn 30, so at turn 32, after eating, turn 33, life span 7? Turn 30:8, turn31:7, turn32:6, turn33:5, etc.\n\nSo at turn 33, head at (2,3), I can go up to (2,4), then to (2,5) but (2,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating at turn 32, positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nAt turn 33, from (1,3), I go right to (2,3), so positions: head to (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), tail (5,2) removed, so [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] tail (5,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go up to (2,4), down to (2,2), left to (1,3) occupied, right to (3,3).\n\n(2,4) free, (2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nSay go up to (2,4) at turn 34.\n\nThen to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied? Positions: (2,5) is in body, so cannot go up to (2,5)? (2,4) to (2,5) is up, but (2,5) is occupied.\n\nAfter move to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail (5,3) removed? Since no food, tail removed.\n\nPositions before move: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] so tail (5,3).\n\nAfter moving to (2,4): new head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (5,3) removed, so positions: [(2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] tail (5,4).\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves: up to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, occupied; down to (2,3) occupied; left to (1,4) occupied; right to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nSo only right to (3,4).\n\nMove to (3,4) at turn 35.\n\nThen from (3,4), and so on.\n\nI can eventually reach (4,6) by going to (3,4), then to (3,3) or (4,4), etc., but need to go up.\n\n(3,4) to (4,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nIt might be possible but takes time.\n\nNow, back to the food (4,6).\n\nTo eat (4,6), I need to be at (5,6) or (4,5) when it's free.\n\nCurrently (4,5) is occupied.\n\nIn the first move, if I go down at turn 30, it was hard to reach up.\n\nBut at turn 30, if I go left, I can eat (1,3) and then have time for (4,6).\n\nSince (4,6) has longer life, I can go for it first if possible.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), from current position (3,5), I can only go down or left, not directly.\n\nIf I go down to (3,4), then I can go right to (4,4), but from (4,4), as before, I could only go down, which led to problems.\n\nAt (3,4), after moving down at turn 30, I have options.\n\nAt (3,4), I can go left to (2,4) or down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n\nIf I go right to (4,4), then as before, only down to (4,3), then I can go left to (3,3) or down to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut to go up, it's blocked.\n\nPerhaps from (3,4), I should go left to (2,4) instead.\n\nAt turn 30, move down to (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 31, from (3,4), go left to (2,4).\n\nPositions: head to (2,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1) removed, so [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail (5,1).\n\nFrom (2,4), moves: up to (2,5), down to (2,3), left to (1,4), right to (3,4) occupied.\n\nAll except right should be free.\n\n(2,5) free, (2,3) free, (1,4) free.\n\nThen I can go up to (2,5) or down to (2,3) or left to (1,4).\n\nThen I can reach (1,3) from here or go to other areas.\n\nFor (4,6), it's still far.\n\nThe quickest way to (4,6) might be to free up (4,5) by moving the snake away.\n\nFor example, if I go left at turn 30 to (2,5), then at turn 31 go up to (2,6), for example.\n\nFrom (2,5), after moving left at turn 30, at turn 31 head at (2,5), I can go up to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, as established.\n\nMove to (2,6) at turn 31.\n\nPositions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1) removed, so [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail (5,1).\n\nFrom (2,6), moves: down to (2,5) occupied, left to (1,6), right to (3,6) wall, up to (2,7) wall.\n\nSo only left to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) free.\n\nMove to (1,6) at turn 32.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1) removed, so [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] tail (5,2).\n\nFrom (1,6), moves: down to (1,5), right to (2,6) occupied, left wall, up wall.\n\nSo only down to (1,5).\n\nMove to (1,5) at turn 33.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), tail (5,2) removed, so [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] tail (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,5), moves: down to (1,4), up to (1,6) occupied, left wall, right to (2,5) occupied.\n\nSo only down to (1,4).\n\nMove to (1,4) at turn 34.\n\nThen to (1,3) at turn 35, but (1,3) food life: at turn 30:6, t31:5, t32:4, t33:3, t34:2, t35:1, so at turn 35 I can eat it if I move to (1,3).\n\nBut from (1,4), at turn 34, move to (1,4), positions: from above, after move to (1,4), head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail (5,3) removed, so [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] tail (5,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), I can go down to (1,3) to eat, or right to (2,4), but (2,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nBut if I go down to (1,3), I eat at turn 34.\n\nLife span at turn 34:2, so I can eat.\n\nBut this takes longer than the first path where I ate at turn 32.\n\nIn this up move, I reached (1,4) at turn 34, then eat at turn 35.\n\nBut in the first direct left-down, I ate at turn 32.\n\nSo better to go directly for the food.\n\nFor (4,6), it might be safer to go for it later since it has longer life.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), I need to have access to (5,6) or (4,5) free.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied, and it will be freed when the snake moves away.\n\nIn the snake body, (4,5) is a segment, so when the tail moves, it might be freed, but tail is at bottom.\n\nIn the initial positions, tail is at (3,1), and it moves when we don't eat food.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat for a few turns, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nBut in this case, with food available, I should eat to grow, but carefully.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nNow, another thing: the head is at (3,5), and if I go down to (3,4), I might be able to go to the right and up later.\n\nBut from (3,4), if I go to (4,4), then only down, which is bad.\n\nAt (3,4), I can go down to (3,3) instead.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn 30, move down to (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 31, from (3,4), go down to (3,3).\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1) removed, so [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail (5,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), moves: up to (3,4) occupied, down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) free, (2,3) free, (4,3) free.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) or (4,3) or (3,2).\n\nFrom here, I can reach (1,3) in a few moves, but (4,6) is still there.\n\nBut (1,3) has short life, so I might miss it if I don't go soon.\n\nAt turn 31, (1,3) life span 5, so I have until turn 35 to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 31, I can go left to (2,3) at turn 32, then to (1,3) at turn 33 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I went left at turn 30, I could eat at turn 32.\n\nSo both ways I can eat (1,3) by turn 33 or earlier.\n\nBut with left move, I can eat at turn 32, with down move, at turn 33.\n\nSo left is faster for (1,3).\n\nFor (4,6), after eating (1,3), I can circle around to get it.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might make it tricky, but (4,6) can be accessed from (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free.\n\nFrom the snake positions after eating (1,3), I can move right and up.\n\nFor example, from head at (1,3) after eating, go right to (2,3), then to (3,3), (4,3), but (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the first path, after eating at turn 32, positions at (1,3), I go right to (2,3) at turn 33, then to (3,3) at turn 34, then to (4,3) at turn 35, then to (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go to (4,4), but (4,4) might be free, then to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, but it might move.\n\nIn the sequence, the body is moving.\n\nAt turn 35, if I'm at (4,3), positions depend on previous.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied until the tail passes.\n\nTail is at (5,3) or something.\n\nIt might take time to free (4,5).\n\nTo reach (5,6), from (4,3) I can go to (5,3) but occupied, or to (4,2), etc.\n\nIt might be messy.\n\nSince (4,6) has life 8, I can go for it after eating (1,3), and I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nNow, the risk in the left move: when I go to (1,3), I am in the corner, but as long as I don't go down to (1,2) or (1,1), I can go right to open space.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) after eating, go right to (2,3), then up to (2,4), etc., as before.\n\nFrom (2,4), I had to go right to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can go up to (3,5) but occupied, or down to (3,3), or left to (2,4) occupied, or right to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) free, so go to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), at that point, (4,5) might still be occupied, but I can go to (4,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nEventually, the tail will move, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, the tail is moving down, so (5,1), (4,1), etc., will be freed.\n\nThen I can go to (5,6) by going to (6,4) or something.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think going for (1,3) first is better because it has shorter life, and I can eat it quickly with the left move.\n\nThen for (4,6), I can approach from the right.\n\nMoreover, the head direction: current direction is L, so moving left is consistent, no instant reverse issue.\n\nMoving down is also ok, since not reverse (reverse would be right, but right is invalid).\n\nFrom L, moving D or L or U, but U invalid, so D or L.\n\nBoth valid.\n\nBut moving L gets me closer to (1,3).\n\nAlso, in the down move, I had a risk of being forced down with limited options.\n\nSo I think moving left at turn 30 is better.\n\nThen at turn 31, from (2,5), I can go down to (2,4) or left to (1,5) or up to (2,6).\n\nTo eat (1,3) fast, I should go left to (1,5) at turn 31, then down to (1,4) at turn 32, then down to (1,3) at turn 32? At turn 32 move to (1,3).\n\nAt turn 31, from (2,5) go left to (1,5), then at turn 32 from (1,5) go down to (1,4), then at turn 33 from (1,4) go down to (1,3) to eat.\n\nBut earlier I thought from (1,5) I can go down to (1,4) at turn 32, then to (1,3) at turn 33.\n\nBut from (1,5), at turn 32, I can go directly down to (1,4), not to (1,3) in one step.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) is down, then from (1,4) to (1,3) is down again.\n\nSo eat at turn 33.\n\nIf at turn 31, from (2,5) I go down to (2,4), then to (2,3), then to (1,3) at turn 33 or 34.\n\nFrom (2,5) go down to (2,4) at turn 31, then from (2,4) go down to (2,3) at turn 32, then from (2,3) go left to (1,3) at turn 33 to eat.\n\nSame turn 33.\n\nBut if I go left from (2,5) to (1,5) at turn 31, then down to (1,4) at turn 32, then down to (1,3) at turn 33.\n\nSame.\n\nAt turn 30 move left to (2,5), then at turn 31 move left to (1,5), at turn 32 move down to (1,4), at turn 33 move down to (1,3) to eat.\n\nThen I have actions for turn 30,31,32,33.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but I need to specify actions starting from turn 30.\n\nThe format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., as many as I can, but probably a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of 5 actions or so.\n\nBut let's see the immediate.\n\nI think moving left at turn 30 is good.\n\nThen for turn 31, from (2,5), I can go left to (1,5) to continue to food.\n\nOr I could go down to (2,4), but that might be slower.\n\nGoing left is direct.\n\nThen turn 32 down to (1,4), turn 33 down to (1,3) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 33 or so.\n\nNow, about the other food, but since it's later, I can decide then.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but tail is far, no issue.\n\nSo for turn 30: move L (left)\n\nThen turn 31: from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 32: from (1,5) move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33: from (1,4) move D to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 34, from (1,3), I should move right to (2,3) to avoid corner.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the sequence.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can provide 4 turns: turn 30 to 33.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (1,3) at turn 33, food life: at turn 30:6, t31:5, t32:4, t33:3, so life 3, I eat, ok.\n\nIf I had moved directly, but I can't.\n\nIn the first quick path, if at turn 30 move L to (2,5), turn 31 move D to (2,4), then turn 32 move L to (2,3)? From (2,4) to (2,3) is down, then to (1,3) left.\n\nFrom (2,4) go down to (2,3) at turn 32, then from (2,3) go left to (1,3) at turn 33 same.\n\nOr from (2,4) go left to (1,4) at turn 32, then down to (1,3) at turn 33.\n\nSame.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 30: L\n\nThen for turn 31, from (2,5), I need to choose.\n\nTo be consistent, I'll go left.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 30: L\n\nTurn 31: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 33: D (to (1,3) eat)\n\nBut I should think one more turn.\n\nAt turn 34, from (1,3), move R to (2,3)\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 33 or 34.\n\nSince the food at (4,6) is available, after eating (1,3), I can head towards it.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) at turn 34, move R to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify.\n\nNow, for the initial move, I think L is better.\n\nBut let's consider if moving down could lead to eating both, but it seems slower and riskier.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with moving left at turn 30.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: The food at (1,3) has a shorter life span (disappears at turn 36) and is closer to the snake's current position, making it the immediate target. The food at (4,6) has a longer life span (disappears at turn 38) and can be pursued later after eating (1,3). Both are positive food (+1, length increase).\n- **Movement Safety**: The snake must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body. The internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks direct access to (4,6), requiring a path via (5,6). After eating (1,3), the snake should move away from the corner to avoid traps.\n- **Path to (1,3)**: From the head at (3,5), moving left to (2,5) is efficient. Then, continuing left to (1,5) and down to (1,4) positions the snake to eat (1,3) by turn 33. This path minimizes turns to reach the food before it expires.\n- **Post-Eating Strategy**: After eating at (1,3), the snake grows to length 10. Moving right to (2,3) opens up space to navigate toward the upper area for (4,6). The tail is moving, freeing cells over time, allowing access to (4,6) via (5,6) later.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving down from (3,5) was considered but leads to limited options (e.g., at (4,4), only down is valid), increasing collision risk. The left path is safer and faster for the critical food. No tail reward danger exists, as the tail is distant.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 30-34)\n- **Turn 30**: Move left (L) to (2,5). This starts the path toward (1,3) and avoids immediate risks.\n- **Turn 31**: Move left (L) to (1,5). Continues the efficient path to the food, with (1,5) free.\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (1,4). Positions for the final move to the food.\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (1,3) to eat the food. This consumes the food before it expires (life span 3 at turn 33).\n- **Turn 34**: Move right (R) to (2,3). After eating, this exits the corner, providing access to open areas for future moves toward (4,6).\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 34)\n- With (1,3) eaten, focus shifts to (4,6). From (2,3), move to (3,3), then (4,3), and up to (5,6) to access (4,6) safely. The life span of (4,6) allows time (disappears at turn 38).\n- Survival is prioritized; if the path to (4,6) becomes risky, alternative routes can be taken to avoid body collisions, leveraging the freeing tail.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the time-sensitive food, grows, and maintains maneuverability for future rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: L (left)  \nTurn 31: L (left)  \nTurn 32: D (down)  \nTurn 33: D (down)  \nTurn 34: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 31. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then body segments at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and tail at (4,1). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,5) from (3,5).\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (1,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- At (4,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,5). Head direction is L, so last move was left. Therefore, I cannot move right instantly because of no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (2,5) are up, down, or left. But left to where? (2,5) moving left would be to (1,5), but I need to check if that's safe.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo cells: let's list available cells.\n\nFor example, row y=0: all x from 0 to 7 are walls except where? No, y=0 is a border wall, so all cells with y=0 are walls. Similarly, y=7 walls, x=0 walls, x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is the tail.\n\nNow, from head at (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (2,6)  (since y increases up)\n\n- Down: to (2,4)\n\n- Left: to (1,5)\n\n- Right: to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Also, head direction is L, so moving right would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So right is invalid.\n\nCannot move right because:\n\n1. Instant reverse: current head direction is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\n2. Even if it were allowed, (3,5) is occupied by body segment.\n\nSo only possible: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n- U: (2,6) – is this free? Let's see what's at (2,6).\n\nWalls: y=7 is top wall, but (2,6) is y=6, x=2. y=6 is not wall, x=2 not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (2,6). Snake positions: (2,6) is not listed, so should be free? But food might be there? Food is at (1,3), (4,6), (4,4). No food at (2,6), so (2,6) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, D: (2,4) – empty? Food at (4,4), not (2,4). Snake not there, walls not there.\n\nL: (1,5) – empty? x=1,y=5. Walls: x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not border. y=5 not border. Internal obstacle (3,6), not here. Food? (1,3) is below, not here. So (1,5) should be empty.\n\nBut (1,5) is a cell, I need to confirm if it's within bounds. x=1, y=5, x from 0 to 7, but x=0 is wall, so x=1 to x=6 are possible? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\ny=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. So for y, 1 to 6 are free, except walls.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=7 wall, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nIn the snake positions, we have (5,1) and (4,1), y=1 which is above y=0, so y=1 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, x=2,3,4,5 at y=5, all valid.\n\nSo for (2,6): y=6, which is below y=7, so valid. x=2 valid.\n\n(2,4): y=4 valid, x=2 valid.\n\n(1,5): x=1 valid, y=5 valid.\n\nNow, are there any obstacles? Internal obstacle at (3,6), not affecting these.\n\nSo all three moves seem possible without immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food positions:\n\n- (1,3): value 1, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 31, so food at (1,3) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 35? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L turns, disappearing at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before turn when it would be 0? Or at turn when countdown reaches 0?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nTo be safe, I think we can assume that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for this turn, and for L-1 more turns? Let's think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so on turn t, for a food with life span L, after processing turn t, the life span becomes L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves there.\n\nFor example, if life span is 1 on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and after that, it disappears.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn t, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, life span 2: present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nIn this case, turn 31.\n\nFood at (1,3): life span 5, so present until turn 35? Life span 5 on turn 31: after turn 31, life span 4, so present on turn 32, and so on, until after turn 35, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 31 to 35 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life span 7, so present turns 31 to 37.\n\n(4,4): life span 10, present turns 31 to 40.\n\nAll positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nCurrent head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each option with future turns in mind.\n\nFirst, move left to (1,5).\n\nThen head at (1,5). From there, possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, so L invalid. R to (2,5), but (2,5) is now the second segment? After moving to (1,5), the snake body: new head at (1,5), then (2,5) which was head, now body, then (3,5), etc., and tail moves? When not eating, tail moves away, so the cell (4,1) is freed if not eaten.\n\nBut in this move, since no food at (1,5), not eating, so length same, tail moves. Tail is at (4,1), so it moves to where? The snake moves, so the tail segment is removed.\n\nAfter moving left to (1,5):\n\n- New positions: head (1,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes segment 2, then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and (4,1) is removed since tail moves. So snake now: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] — 9 segments, but (5,1) was there, and (4,1) removed, so segments: from head to tail: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Tail is (5,1).\n\nNow, from (1,5), possible moves:\n\nU: (1,6) — free? y=6, x=1, no wall, no snake? Snake has (1,5) head, (2,5), etc., not at (1,6). Food? No, so free.\n\nD: (1,4) — free.\n\nR: (2,5) — but (2,5) is now body segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nL: (0,5) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (1,5), can go U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then head at (1,6). Then possible moves from there.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (1,3) is below, at (1,3).\n\nIf I go to (1,5), then I can go down to (1,4), then to (1,3) to eat.\n\n(1,3) has food, life span 5, so I can eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks, like collisions.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (5,1), far away, so no issue.\n\nNow, another move: up from current to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, no food.\n\nThen head at (2,6). From there, possible moves: U to (2,7), but y=7 wall, invalid. D to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body? After moving to (2,6), new head (2,6), then (2,5) becomes body, so (2,5) occupied. L to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) has internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (1,6) — free? x=1,y=6, no wall, no snake, no food.\n\nD to (2,5) — occupied, invalid.\n\nSo from (2,6), can only go L to (1,6) or possibly U but U invalid, so only L.\n\nU invalid, D invalid, R invalid (wall), so only possible move is L to (1,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), similar to above.\n\nBut this seems limiting.\n\nDown from current to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) free, no food.\n\nThen head at (2,4). From there, possible moves: U to (2,5) — but (2,5) is now body, occupied, invalid. D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) free? y=3, x=2, no wall, no snake? Snake is at (5,3), but not (2,3). Food at (1,3), not here. So (2,3) free.\n\n(1,4) free, (3,4) free? (3,4) no wall, snake? Snake has (3,5), (4,5), etc., not (3,4). Food at (4,4), not (3,4). So free.\n\nAlso, head direction: after moving down to (2,4), direction is D, so cannot move up instantly.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4): D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4). U invalid because of body and instant reverse? Instant reverse: current direction after move is D, so moving U would be opposite, not allowed. Also, (2,5) occupied.\n\nSo can go D, L, or R.\n\nNow, food at (1,3) is close, and (4,4) is at (4,4), which is near.\n\n(4,4) has food, life span 10, plenty of time.\n\n(1,3) life span 5, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) at (4,6), which is above.\n\nBut (4,6) has internal obstacle? No, internal obstacle at (3,6), which is adjacent, but (4,6) is free.\n\n(4,6) is a food position.\n\nNow, let's think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, to eat (1,3): from current (2,5), I can go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), then down to (1,3) to eat on turn 33 or something.\n\nTurn 31: move to (1,5)\n\nTurn 32: move to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33: move to (1,3) and eat, length increases.\n\nBut after eating, tail grows, so positions change.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,5) down to (2,4), then left to (1,4), then down to (1,3), same thing but one turn later? Let's see turns.\n\nFrom (2,5):\n\nOption A: L to (1,5) on turn 31\n\nThen on turn 32, from (1,5) to (1,4) (D)\n\nThen on turn 33, from (1,4) to (1,3) (D) and eat.\n\nSo eat on turn 33.\n\nOption B: from (2,5) D to (2,4) on turn 31\n\nThen on turn 32, from (2,4) to (1,4) (L)\n\nThen on turn 33, from (1,4) to (1,3) (D) and eat.\n\nSame, eat on turn 33.\n\nBut in option A, after turn 31 at (1,5), I could go down or up, but going down directly to food is better.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,4) food.\n\n(4,4) is at x=4,y=4.\n\nFrom current (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then down to (4,4)? (3,4) to (4,4) is right? (3,4) to (4,4) is east, R.\n\nBut (4,4) has food.\n\nPath: from (2,5) D to (2,4) turn 31\n\nThen from (2,4) R to (3,4) turn 32\n\nThen from (3,4) R to (4,4) turn 33 and eat.\n\nEat on turn 33.\n\nBut (1,3) is also eatable on turn 33 if I go left first.\n\nI can only do one.\n\n(4,6) food at (4,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go up to (2,6), then only left to (1,6), then from (1,6) I can go down to (1,5), but (1,5) might be occupied later.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), then to (1,4), etc., but to get to (4,6) is hard from there.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is near the obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is east of it.\n\nFrom current position, to reach (4,6), I need to go via (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, so I cannot go directly.\n\nAvailable cells around (4,6): (4,6) itself, but to access it, I can come from (4,5), (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, (5,6) x=5,y=6, or (3,6) wall, so only from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by snake body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is free? x=5,y=6, no wall, no snake? Snake is at (5,5), (5,4), etc., not (5,6). Food? No, so free.\n\nSo to eat (4,6), I need to move to (5,6) or (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied now.\n\nAfter some moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, the body moves, so (4,5) might be freed when the snake moves away.\n\nBut (4,5) is a body segment now, and when the snake moves, if not eating, the tail moves, so positions shift.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAlso, life span: (4,6) life span 7, so until turn 37, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) until turn 40.\n\n(1,3) until turn 35, so I have until turn 35 to eat it.\n\nBut turn 35 is soon, only 4 turns from now (turns 31,32,33,34,35: 5 turns including 31, so eat by 35).\n\nSince life span 5 on turn 31, can be eaten on turn 31 to 35.\n\nTurn 31: if I move to (1,3) directly? But from (2,5) to (1,3) is not adjacent, must move one step at a time.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4) or left to (1,5), but not directly to (1,3).\n\nSo minimum two moves to reach (1,3): e.g., (2,5) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) or (2,5) to (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,3), both take three actions to eat: on turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,4): from (2,5) to (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) on turn 33.\n\nBut (4,4) has life span 10, no rush.\n\n(4,6) is trickier because of the obstacle.\n\nNow, I need to consider the board and snake body for collisions.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nMoreover, the tail position: tail is at (4,1), which is near the bottom.\n\nNow, let's think about long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is currently in the top-left area, but body goes down to (5,1).\n\nIf I eat (1,3), I grow to 10 segments, and I'm near the left wall.\n\nThen I need to find other food.\n\n(4,4) is available, but I need to move right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is there.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (3,6), the area around (4,6) might be risky.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,4) is on a cell that might be under the snake body? (4,4) is not currently occupied, snake is at (4,5), (5,5), etc., not (4,4). (4,4) is free.\n\nBut it can be eaten when head moves there.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let's consider if I can eat multiple foods.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3), I can go to (4,4) or (4,6).\n\nBut from (1,3), I need to move to the right.\n\nBut the snake body might block.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, I should prioritize eating (1,3) since it has shorter life span, only until turn 35, and I can eat it on turn 33 if I start moving towards it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat it, I miss +1 score.\n\n(4,6) has longer life, (4,4) even longer.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (1,5), then I'm near the left wall, and if I go down to (1,4) and (1,3), I might be trapped if not careful.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3), the snake head at (1,3), length 10.\n\nThen from there, I can move right to (2,3) or up to (1,4), but (1,4) might be body or free.\n\nLet's simulate the moves.\n\nAssume I go for (1,3) via left first.\n\nTurn 31: move L to (1,5)\n\nSnake now: head (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,4)\n\nNow head (1,4), body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and tail (5,1) moves? Since not eating, tail moves away, so (5,1) removed, new tail is (5,2)? Positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — tail (5,2)\n\n(5,2) was previously there, now tail.\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,3) and eat, since food there.\n\nNow, eating, so length increases, tail does not move.\n\nHead to (1,3), new segment, so body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — and since ate, add a segment, so tail stays, positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — 10 segments, tail at (5,2)\n\nNow, from head (1,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,4) but (1,4) is body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (1,2) — y=2, x=1, free? Walls: y=0 wall, but y=2 ok. Snake? Not there. Food? No. But y=2 is above y=0, ok.\n\nL to (0,3) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,3) — free? (2,3) no snake, no wall.\n\nSo can go D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (1,2), then I'm going down, near bottom wall.\n\nThen from there, I might go right to (2,2), etc., but I need to get to other food.\n\nIf I go R to (2,3), then I can go to (3,3), etc., towards (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is free now.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), then to (4,3) or (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at y=4,x=4.\n\nFrom (2,3), to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (4,4) to eat.\n\nOr directly if possible.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 31 decision.\n\nIf I go down to (2,4) instead.\n\nTurn 31: D to (2,4)\n\nSnake: head (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1)? After move, not eating, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: before move, head (2,5), body (3,5) to (4,1)\n\nAfter move down to (2,4), new head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and (4,1) removed, so tail is (5,1)\n\nSegments: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\nNow from (2,4), I can go to (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (1,4), then to (1,3) to eat.\n\nTurn 32: L to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 33: D to (1,3) eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from (2,4) I go to (3,4), then to (4,4) to eat on turn 33.\n\nTurn 31: at (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 33: R to (4,4) and eat (4,4) food.\n\nThen I eat (4,4) instead of (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) has shorter life, only until turn 35, so if I don't eat it soon, I might lose it.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) on turn 33, I can still go to (1,3) later.\n\nFrom after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), I can go left to (3,4), but (3,4) might be body, or down to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and down.\n\nThe snake body is between, might be blocked.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4) on turn 33:\n\nAssume turn 31: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 33: R to (4,4) eat\n\nNow, head (4,4), ate, so length increases, tail does not move.\n\nPrevious body: before move, head was at (3,4)? Turn 32 head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), etc.\n\nAfter turn 33 move to (4,4) and eat, so new head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and (5,1) is tail, but since ate, tail stays, so positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and (5,1) — 11 segments? Original was 9, ate one, so 10 segments.\n\nList: head (4,4), then the previous head (3,4), then (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and tail (5,1) remains since ate. (5,1) was tail before, but when not eating, it moves, but when eating, it stays.\n\nAfter move to (4,4) and eat, the new body includes all previous positions plus the new head, but the tail does not advance, so the segment that was tail remains.\n\nBefore turn 33 move, snake positions: head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1)\n\nAfter move to (4,4) and eat: new head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and since ate, add a segment, so tail is still (5,2)? No.\n\nThe positions: the body segments remain, and head moves to new position, so the list becomes [new head, old head, old body except tail if not eating, but when eating, the tail is not removed, so all old positions are kept, and new head is added.\n\nSo before move: positions P = [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ] head at (3,4), tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) and eating: new positions [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) ] since ate, tail not removed, so length 11, tail at (5,1)\n\n(5,1) is still there.\n\nNow, from head (4,4), direction R (since moved right to (4,4)? From (3,4) to (4,4) is right, so head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body segment, occupied.\n\nD to (4,3) — free? (4,3) no snake, no wall.\n\nL to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,4) is in the body list.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (4,3), since U,L,R all occupied or invalid.\n\nU occupied, L occupied, R occupied, only D free.\n\nSo must go down to (4,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut now to reach (1,3), it's at (1,3), which is left and up, but the body is blocking the way directly. I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) has life span until turn 35, so by turn 35 I need to be there.\n\nCurrent turn 33, so on turn 34 and 35 I can move.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 33, after eating.\n\nTurn 33: head at (4,4) after eating, then move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 34: from (4,3) to (3,3) L\n\nTurn 35: from (3,3) to (2,3) L or something.\n\n(2,3) to (1,3) on turn 36? But turn 35 is the last chance to eat (1,3).\n\nLife span: on turn 31, life span 5, so present on turn 31,32,33,34,35. Disappears after turn 35.\n\nCan be eaten on turn 35.\n\nTurn 35 is ok.\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 33:\n\n- Turn 34: move to (3,3) (L)\n\n- Turn 35: move to (2,3) (L) or to (3,2) but need to go to (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), to (2,3), then on turn 36 to (1,3) but turn 36 is too late, (1,3) disappears after turn 35.\n\nSo on turn 35, I need to be at (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 34, I can go to (2,3) on turn 34 or to (3,2), but (2,3) is not (1,3).\n\nOn turn 35, from (2,3) I can go to (1,3) directly if I move left.\n\nLet's timeline:\n\nTurn 33: head at (4,4) after eating (4,4), then move D to (4,3) — now turn 33 ends, head at (4,3)\n\nTurn 34: from (4,3), I can move to (3,3) (L) or (4,2) (D) or (5,3) but (5,3) is body? Body includes (5,3), so occupied, so only L or D or U? U to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, occupied. So only L to (3,3) or D to (4,2)\n\nSay move L to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3)\n\nTurn 35: from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) but (3,4) body, occupied; D to (3,2); L to (2,3); R to (4,3) but (4,3) is now body? After moving to (3,3), the previous position (4,3) is body.\n\nAfter turn 34 move to (3,3), new head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), etc. from previous.\n\nPositions: before turn 34, head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\nAfter move to (3,3) not eating, so tail moves, new positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — tail (5,2), (5,1) removed.\n\nFrom head (3,3), direction L (moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4) — but (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (3,2)\n\nL to (2,3) — (2,3) free? No snake, no wall.\n\nR to (4,3) — (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nSo can go D or L.\n\nTo reach (1,3) on turn 35, I need to be at (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 34, I can go to (2,3) on turn 34 or to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 35, from (2,3) I can go L to (1,3) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo turn 34: from (3,3) to (2,3) L\n\nTurn 35: from (2,3) to (1,3) L and eat.\n\nSo it is possible to eat (1,3) on turn 35 if I go for (4,4) first.\n\nBut I have to move carefully.\n\nIf I go for (1,3) first, I eat it on turn 33, then I can go for (4,4) later.\n\nBut (4,4) has long life, no rush.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is available.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nAnother option: going up to (2,6) on turn 31.\n\nBut from (2,6), I can only go left to (1,6), then from (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), then to (1,4), etc., but to eat (1,3), it takes more turns.\n\nTurn 31: U to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 32: only possible move L to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 33: from (1,6) to (1,5) D\n\nThen turn 34: to (1,4) D\n\nThen turn 35: to (1,3) D and eat.\n\nEat on turn 35, same as above.\n\nBut in this case, I don't eat any food until turn 35, and I might miss if something happens.\n\nWhereas if I go down or left first, I can eat on turn 33.\n\nGoing to (2,6) seems inefficient for eating soon.\n\nMoreover, after that, I'm at (1,6), which is corner, might be trapped.\n\nSo probably not good.\n\nTherefore, better to go for immediate food.\n\nNow, between (1,3) and (4,4), (1,3) has shorter life, so I should eat it first to not miss it.\n\n(4,4) has life 10, so after turn 31, 10 turns, until turn 40, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) until turn 37.\n\nSo priority: eat (1,3) by turn 35.\n\nTo eat it on turn 33, I can go directly towards it.\n\nFrom current, go left to (1,5) or down to (2,4), both can lead to eating on turn 33.\n\nBut if I go down to (2,4), I have the option to go to (4,4) instead, but I should go for (1,3) to secure it.\n\nIf I go left to (1,5), I am committed to going down to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (2,4), I can choose to go left to (1,4) then (1,3), or right to (3,4) then (4,4).\n\nBut to avoid risk of missing (1,3), I should go left.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,3), I can go to (4,4) or (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) might be harder due to obstacle.\n\nLet's think about the area around (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food, but to access it, I need to approach from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by snake body, and it might free up when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, (4,5) could be freed.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is free.\n\nSo I can go to (5,6) then to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), and from (5,6), moving left to (4,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, from current position, how to get there.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but tail is far, no food on tail.\n\nNow, another thing: if I eat (1,3) on turn 33, then head at (1,3), I can move right to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (4,4) to eat on turn 37 or so.\n\nBut (4,4) can be eaten earlier if I go directly.\n\nBut since life long, ok.\n\nI could eat (4,4) first if I go down then right.\n\nBut (1,3) might be missed if I delay.\n\nFor example, if I eat (4,4) on turn 33, then as before, I can still eat (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nBut in that case, I eat two foods: (4,4) on 33 and (1,3) on 35.\n\nIf I eat (1,3) on 33, then (4,4) on say 37, I eat both, but later for (4,4).\n\nBut score same, +1 each.\n\nBut I might eat more.\n\n(4,6) is also there.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupation.\n\nAfter eating (4,4) on turn 33 and then (1,3) on turn 35, the snake is longer, and I can go for (4,6).\n\nFor example, from (1,3) after eating on turn 35, head at (1,3), then I can go to (2,3), etc., to (4,3), then to (4,4) but (4,4) food is eaten, so empty, then to (4,5), but (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn the sequence where I ate (4,4) first, (4,4) is gone.\n\nSo after turn 35, I can go to (4,5) or (5,6) to access (4,6).\n\nBut (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nTo minimize risk, since (1,3) has shorter life, I should eat it first.\n\nBut in the other sequence, I can eat both by turn 35.\n\nLet's compare the two options for turn 31.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,5) on turn 31, then D to (1,4) turn 32, D to (1,3) eat turn 33.\n\nThen on turn 33, head at (1,3), I can move R to (2,3) turn 34, then to (3,3) turn 35, etc. towards (4,4).\n\nEat (4,4) later.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (2,4) on turn 31, then R to (3,4) turn 32, R to (4,4) eat turn 33.\n\nThen on turn 33, head at (4,4), move D to (4,3) turn 33 (since only choice), then L to (3,3) turn 34, then L to (2,3) turn 35? On turn 34 at (3,3), I can go L to (2,3) on turn 34, then on turn 35 from (2,3) to (1,3) L and eat.\n\nSo in option 2, I eat (4,4) on turn 33 and (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nIn option 1, I eat (1,3) on turn 33 and (4,4) later, say on turn 36 or 37.\n\nSo option 2 gives me two foods by turn 35, while option 1 gives one by turn 33 and one later.\n\nBut score is the same, but in option 2, I secure both sooner, and (1,3) is eaten on time.\n\nMoreover, in option 2, after eating (4,4), I have to move down, but it's ok.\n\nNow, what about the food at (4,6)? I can go for it after.\n\nIn both cases, I can.\n\nBut in option 2, on turn 31 I move down to (2,4), which is closer to (4,4) and (4,6) potentially.\n\nWhereas in option 1, I go left to corner.\n\nAlso, in option 2, when I move to (2,4), I have more choices: I can go to (1,4) or (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nSo more flexible.\n\nMoreover, if I go to (2,4), I can still go to (1,4) and (1,3) as above.\n\nSo option 2 seems better.\n\nNow, about the move to (2,6): not good, as it wastes time.\n\nSo for turn 31, move down to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 32, move right to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 33, move right to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 34, from (4,4) only down to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 35, from (4,3) I need to go to (3,3) or (4,2), but to reach (1,3) on turn 35, from (4,3) on turn 33? After turn 33, head at (4,4), move to (4,3) on turn 34.\n\nTurn 34: head at (4,3)\n\nThen to reach (1,3) on turn 35, I need to be at (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 34, I can move to (3,3) on turn 34, then to (2,3) on turn 35, but (2,3) to (1,3) on turn 36, too late.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 34, I can only move to (3,3) or (4,2) or (5,3) but (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo say move to (3,3) on turn 34.\n\nThen on turn 35, from (3,3) to (2,3) or (3,2), not to (1,3) directly.\n\n(1,3) is two steps away from (3,3), so I cannot reach on turn 35 from turn 34 position.\n\nOn turn 34, I am at (4,3) or (3,3), both not adjacent to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3; (3,3) is at x=3,y=3, so not adjacent; (4,3) farther.\n\nSo on turn 35, the closest I can be is (2,3) if I move from (3,3) on turn 35, but (2,3) to (1,3) is move on turn 36.\n\nBut (1,3) must be eaten on turn 35, so if I am not at (1,3) on turn 35, I miss it.\n\nTherefore, if I go for (4,4) first, I cannot eat (1,3) on turn 35 because I can't reach it in time from there.\n\nTurn 31: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 33: R to (4,4) eat — now turn 33 ends\n\nTurn 34: from (4,4) move D to (4,3) — turn 34 ends, head at (4,3)\n\nTurn 35: from (4,3), move to (3,3) or (4,2)\n\nBut (3,3) is not (1,3), and I have no move to (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nThe only way to eat (1,3) on turn 35 is to be at (1,4) or (2,3) or (1,2) on turn 34, then move to (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nBut in this sequence, on turn 34, I am at (4,3), far away.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (4,4) first, I cannot reach (1,3) by turn 35; I miss it.\n\nWhereas if I go to (1,3) first, I eat it on turn 33.\n\nSo for (1,3), to eat it by turn 35, I must start moving towards it by turn 31 or 32 at latest.\n\nSpecifically, to be at (1,3) on turn 35, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 34: (1,4), (1,2), or (2,3).\n\n(1,2) might be near wall.\n\nBut from current, if I go to (1,5) on turn 31, then to (1,4) on turn 32, then on turn 33 to (1,3) eat, or if I delay, on turn 34 at (1,4), turn 35 to (1,3) eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4) on turn 31, to (1,4) on turn 32, then to (1,3) on turn 33 or 35.\n\nBut to secure it, I should go directly.\n\nTherefore, to not miss (1,3), I should move towards it on turn 31.\n\nSo move left to (1,5) or down to (2,4) and then left.\n\nBut moving left directly is fine.\n\nThen for turn 32, move down to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33, move down to (1,3) eat.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (4,4).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but I need to output the sequence.\n\nThe current turn is t1=31, so I need to output for turn 31, 32, 33, etc., but how many?\n\nIt says \"...\" so probably a few turns, but since think ahead, I should output at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I don't have to, but to demonstrate the plan.\n\nPerhaps output the actions for the next 5 turns or until a key point.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I can output for turns 31 to 35 or so.\n\nBut let's decide the moves.\n\nBased on above, to eat (1,3) safely, I should move left on turn 31.\n\nThen down on 32, down on 33 to eat.\n\nThen after that, on turn 34, from (1,3), I can move right to (2,3), then on turn 35 to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) and (4,4) are still there.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), head at (1,3), I can move right to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (4,4) to eat.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), so from (4,3) to (4,4) up? (4,3) to (4,4) is north, U.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) can be accessed from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nBut (4,5) might be free by then.\n\nSince I need to output actions, let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 31: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,3) and eat\n\nNow, after that, on turn 34, from (1,3), direction D, so can move R to (2,3) or D to (1,2) (since U to (1,4) occupied, L invalid)\n\nSay move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 35: from (2,3), can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3) occupied or invalid, R to (3,3)\n\nNow, to go to (4,4), I can go to (3,3) then to (4,3) then to (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) has food, so I can eat it when I reach.\n\nSimilarly, I can plan.\n\nBut for the answer, I think outputting up to turn 35 is fine.\n\nSince the life span of (1,3) is covered.\n\nNow, about the initial head direction: current head direction is L, so moving L is allowed, not reverse.\n\nMoving D is also allowed, since not opposite to L.\n\nL is left, D is down, not opposite.\n\nOpposite would be R.\n\nSo L and D are both fine.\n\nBut to be safe for (1,3), move L on turn 31.\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the plan is to first secure the positive food at (1,3) due to its short life span (5 turns, disappearing after turn 35). Eating this food on turn 33 avoids missing it and provides an immediate score increase. After that, the snake will navigate toward the food at (4,4), which has a longer life span (10 turns), ensuring it can be eaten later without risk. The food at (4,6) is less urgent (life span 7 turns) and will be considered after securing (4,4). The sequence avoids collisions and dead ends by steering clear of walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Turn 31-33: Secure (1,3) food**  \n  Move left to (1,5) on turn 31, then down to (1,4) on turn 32, and down to (1,3) to eat on turn 33. This path is safe and efficient, using the minimum moves to reach the food before it expires.\n  \n- **Turn 34-35 and beyond: Navigate toward (4,4)**  \n  After eating at (1,3), move right to (2,3) on turn 34 to avoid the left wall and open paths. On turn 35, move right to (3,3) to position for accessing (4,4) in subsequent turns. This avoids the body and obstacle at (3,6), ensuring flexibility for future moves.\n\n- **Risks Mitigated**:\n  - No instant reverse: Current head direction is left, so moving left on turn 31 is allowed. Down on turn 32 and 33 is perpendicular, not reverse.\n  - Collision avoidance: All moves avoid walls, the obstacle at (3,6), and body segments. For example, moving to (1,5) is safe as it is unoccupied.\n  - Tail reward danger: The tail is at (5,1) or similar, far from (1,3), so no risk when eating.\n  - Long-term survival: After eating (1,3), the snake grows but has ample space to maneuver toward (4,4) without trapping itself. The food at (4,6) can be accessed later via (5,6) if (4,5) is freed.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 31-35):\n- **Turn 31**: Move left (L) to (1,5) – Positions snake for direct path to (1,3).\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (1,4) – Advances toward (1,3) safely.\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (1,3) – Eats food, increasing length to 10.\n- **Turn 34**: Move right (R) to (2,3) – Exits the left wall area and avoids body collisions.\n- **Turn 35**: Move right (R) to (3,3) – Positions for future move to (4,4), keeping (1,3) food accessible until its expiration.\n\nBeyond turn 35, the snake can move to (4,3) then (4,4) to eat the next food, leveraging the open path. This plan scores +1 by turn 33 and sets up for additional gains while minimizing risk over 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: L (left)  \nTurn 32: D (down)  \nTurn 33: D (down)  \nTurn 34: R (right)  \nTurn 35: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 32, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,5), then body segments: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So the snake is 9 cells long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (1,3) with value 1, life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it'll be gone by turn 36 if not eaten.\n\n- At (4,6) with value 1, life span 6. Disappears after turn 38.\n\n- At (4,4) with value 1, life span 9. Disappears after turn 41.\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a simple map.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake: head at (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So it's like the snake is mostly horizontal from (1,5) to (5,5), then down to (5,1).\n\nHead direction L, so last move was left to (1,5) from (2,5)? Positions are given head first: (1,5) is head, then (2,5) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n\nSince head direction is L, it was moving left, so from (2,5) to (1,5) last turn.\n\nNow, possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since last direction was L, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So allowed moves are U, D, L. Not R.\n\nCurrent head position (1,5). From here:\n\n- Up (U): (1,6) — y increases, so (1,5+1) = (1,6)\n\n- Down (D): (1,4) — (1,5-1) = (1,4)\n\n- Left (L): (0,5) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right (R): (2,5) — but (2,5) is the first body segment, and also, since no reverse, I can't go right anyway.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied by the body, so moving right would collide with body. Also, since head direction was L, moving R is opposite, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves are U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\n(1,6): is this within bounds? y=6 is not y=7, so y=6 is ok, x=1 ok. But walls: border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) is not a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (1,6). So (1,6) is empty, I think? Need to check if occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So (1,6) not occupied.\n\nFood: (1,3), (4,6), (4,4) — not at (1,6).\n\nSo (1,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake has (5,4), but that's different cell. (1,4) is free.\n\nFood at (1,3) is below, but (1,4) is empty.\n\nSo possible actions: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns to decide which is better.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (1,3) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns including this turn 32. So after turn 32, it has 3 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life_span is given as L at turn t, it means it will disappear after L turns, counting from turn t.\n\nSo for (1,3): life_span 4 at turn 32, so it exists on turns 32,33,34,35, and disappears before turn 36? \"Disappears after N turns\" — after N turns from now.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, countdown = N, after turn t, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn.\n\nStandard way: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nBut to be precise for planning.\n\nSince we move and eat on the same turn, I think we can assume that at the beginning of turn t, food is present if life_span >0.\n\nFor (1,3): life_span 4 at turn 32, so present on turns 32,33,34,35. After turn 35, it disappears, so not on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life_span 6, present turns 32 to 37.\n\n(4,4): life_span 9, present turns 32 to 40.\n\nNow, back to current move: from (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then head is at (1,6), and since I moved up, direction becomes U.\n\nThen next turn, I can go U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse would be down, but since I moved up, reverse is down, so I cannot move down on next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (1,4), direction becomes D, then I cannot move up next turn.\n\nNow, I need to consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, let's list the food positions:\n\n- (1,3): value +1, life_span 4 (turns 32-35)\n\n- (4,6): value +1, life_span 6 (turns 32-37)\n\n- (4,4): value +1, life_span 9 (turns 32-40)\n\n(4,4) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\n(1,3) has short life, only 4 turns including this one, so I might want to eat it soon if possible.\n\nBut to eat (1,3), I need to get the head to (1,3).\n\nCurrently at (1,5), so (1,3) is two cells down.\n\nBut (1,4) is directly above it? (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3).\n\nIf I go down to (1,4) this turn, then on turn 33, I can go down to (1,3) to eat it, since life_span 4, it will be there on turn 33? Turn 32: present, after turn 32, life_span decreases to 3, still present on turn 33, etc.\n\nIf I move to (1,3) on turn 33, it should be fine.\n\nBut is (1,3) safe to eat? I need to check if it's under the body or something.\n\nSnake positions: no one at (1,3), so it's free.\n\nBut there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, when I eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut here, (1,3) is not the tail; tail is at (5,1).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nFirst option: Go down to (1,4) on turn 32.\n\nThen on turn 33, go down to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nBut let's see the state after that.\n\nAfter turn 32 move to (1,4): new positions: head to (1,4), then body: previous head (1,5) becomes new segment 1, then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Tail is still (5,1).\n\nNow, direction is down.\n\nThen turn 33: move to (1,3), eat food. Now head at (1,3), new segment added, so positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Tail is (5,1), which will move when we move next, but since we ate, tail stays until next move without eating.\n\nWhen we eat, on that turn, after moving to food, we grow, so the tail doesn't move; we add a new segment at the head position after move, but since head moves to food, we add a segment there, and tail remains.\n\nSo after eating at (1,3), the snake has head at (1,3), and the tail is still at (5,1). When we move next turn, the tail will move only if we don't eat.\n\nBut after eating, the length increases, so the tail stays for one more turn before moving.\n\nIn terms of positions: after move to food, head is at food, and we add a new segment, so the previous tail remains.\n\nFor example, before move to (1,3), positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (5,1) — after move down to (1,3), head to (1,3), and since we eat, we add a segment, so the body becomes (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., and tail (5,1) is still there. So positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So 11 segments? No.\n\nBefore move: at turn 33 start, after turn 32 move, positions are: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — 10 positions? Let's count.\n\nAfter turn 32: moved to (1,4), so snake: head (1,4), then the previous positions except tail might move, but in snake, when moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was head becomes the neck, and so on, tail moves away from its position if no growth.\n\nBut when we eat, we don't remove the tail; we keep it and add a new head, so length increases.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt start of turn 32: snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — 9 segments.\n\nAfter move to (1,4) on turn 32: head moves to (1,4), and since we didn't eat (no food there), the tail (5,1) is removed? No.\n\nWhen moving without eating: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nWith eating: head moves to new position (with food), food is eaten, new segment is added, so tail stays, length increases.\n\nBut at (1,4), is there food? Food is at (1,3), (4,6), (4,4), not at (1,4), so moving to (1,4) does not eat food, so no growth.\n\nSo after move to (1,4) on turn 32: head is at (1,4), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (1,5), second to (2,5), and so on, up to the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (5,1), and the tail at (5,1) is removed? Positions: the body segments shift.\n\nLet's list indices.\n\nAt turn 32 start: positions index 0: head (1,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: tail (5,1)\n\nAfter moving down to (1,4): new head at (1,4). Segment 0 was head, now it becomes body at (1,5). Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, (2,5) to (1,5)? No.\n\nStandard: new head position is (1,4). Then the previous head (1,5) becomes the new segment 1. Then segment 1 (was (2,5)) moves to the old position of segment 0, which is (1,5)? Confusion.\n\nBetter to think: the head moves to the new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it from the previous state.\n\nAfter move, the new position of segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>0, and new head is the move cell.\n\nFor i from 0: new pos[0] = (1,4)  // new head\n\nnew pos[1] = old pos[0] = (1,5)\n\nnew pos[2] = old pos[1] = (2,5)\n\nnew pos[3] = old pos[2] = (3,5)\n\nnew pos[4] = old pos[3] = (4,5)\n\nnew pos[5] = old pos[4] = (5,5)\n\nnew pos[6] = old pos[5] = (5,4)\n\nnew pos[7] = old pos[6] = (5,3)\n\nnew pos[8] = old pos[7] = (5,2)  // new tail, and old tail (5,1) is removed since no growth.\n\nOld pos[8] was (5,1), which is not occupied anymore.\n\nSo after turn 32 move to (1,4): positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)  -- 9 segments, tail at (5,2)\n\nDirection is down.\n\nNow turn 33: move to (1,3), which has food. So we eat, grow.\n\nNew head at (1,3), add new segment, so positions: head (1,3), then new segment at old head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)  -- and the tail (5,2) remains, so 10 segments. Tail is still (5,2), but it will move next time if no eat.\n\nPositions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I go down to (1,4) on turn 32, I can eat (1,3) on turn 33.\n\nBut on turn 32, when I move to (1,4), no food, so no issue.\n\nThen on turn 33, eat (1,3), get +1 score.\n\nBut after that, I'm at (1,3) with direction down.\n\nThen I need to see where to go from there.\n\nThe other food is at (4,6) and (4,4), which are on the right side.\n\nBut let's see the other option: go up to (1,6) on turn 32.\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction up.\n\nThen on turn 33, I can move U, L, R (not D, since reverse).\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves:\n\nU to (1,7) -- but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nL to (0,6) -- x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) -- possible? (2,6) is not wall, not occupied? Snake positions after move: after moving to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) -- tail at (5,1)? After move to (1,6) without eating.\n\nSimilar to before: new head (1,6), then body: (1,5) from old head, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and new tail at (5,1)? Old tail (5,1) is removed.\n\nAt start turn 32: positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n\nAfter move U to (1,6): new head (1,6), new pos[1] = old pos[0] = (1,5), new pos[2] = old pos[1] = (2,5), ..., new pos[8] = old pos[7] = (5,2), and old pos[8] (5,1) removed.\n\nSo positions: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) -- tail at (5,2)\n\nNow, from (1,6), on turn 33, possible moves: U (1,7) wall, invalid; L (0,6) wall, invalid; R (2,6); D (1,5) but (1,5) is occupied by the body, so collision if I go down.\n\n(1,5) is the first body segment, so moving to it would be collision.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is not wall, not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen on turn 33, move to (2,6), no food there, so positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), etc., tail moves to (5,3) or something.\n\nBut I'm moving away from the food at (1,3), which has short life.\n\nIf I go up on turn 32, I can't reach (1,3) in time because from (1,6), I have to go right to (2,6), then I might go down or something, but (1,3) is at y=3, I'm at y=6, so at least 3 moves down, but by turn 35, it might be gone.\n\nTurn 32: I move to (1,6)\n\nTurn 33: move to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 34: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied? After turn 33 positions: let's not get bogged down.\n\nIf I go up on turn 32, I likely miss the food at (1,3) because by the time I get down, it might be gone or I have to rush.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) on turn 33, I could move down to (2,5), but (2,5) is part of the body? After turn 33, positions depend.\n\nAssume turn 33 move to (2,6): head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) -- tail at (5,3)? After move: new head (2,6), new body: (1,6) from old head, (1,5) from old pos[1], (2,5) from old pos[2], etc., up to new tail from old pos[7] or something.\n\nEasier to simulate.\n\nBut point is, (2,5) is occupied by body after turn 33, so if I move to (2,5) on turn 34, collision.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 34, possible moves: U (2,7) wall, D (2,5) occupied, L (1,6) occupied (body), R (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is where the internal obstacle is? Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is a wall, so invalid.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6), so (3,6) is wall.\n\nSo from (2,6), moves: U wall, D to (2,5) occupied, L to (1,6) occupied, R to (3,6) wall. All invalid? That can't be right.\n\n(2,6) to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied? After turn 33 positions: head at (2,6), then body segments: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo (2,5) is the third segment, so occupied, yes.\n\n(1,6) is first body segment, occupied.\n\n(3,6) is wall.\n\nSo indeed, from (2,6) on turn 34, no possible moves? But that would be death, which is bad.\n\nIf I go up on turn 32 to (1,6), then on turn 33 only move is to (2,6), then on turn 34, I'm stuck, no moves, collision or wall.\n\nSo going up leads to death on turn 34.\n\nTherefore, going up is not viable; it's a dead end.\n\nSo I must go down to (1,4) on turn 32.\n\nThen, as before, on turn 33, I can go down to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nBut let's confirm the moves.\n\nTurn 32: move down to (1,4)\n\nAfter move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) -- tail at (5,2)\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow turn 33: move down to (1,3), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (1,3), add new segment, so positions: head (1,3), then (1,4) (new segment), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) -- and tail remains? Length increases.\n\nPrevious positions: after turn 32, 9 segments: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,3) and eat: new head (1,3), then new body segment at previous head (1,4), then the rest: (1,5), (2,5), ..., (5,2), so positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) -- 10 segments, tail at (5,2)\n\nDirection is down.\n\nNow, from here, I need to plan ahead.\n\nFood left: (4,6) life until turn 37, and (4,4) until turn 40.\n\nI am at (1,3), need to go to (4,6) or (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is closer, but let's see the path.\n\nFirst, from (1,3), with direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R except reverse. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up? Direction is down, so reverse is up, so I cannot move up on next turn.\n\nBut moving up to (1,4) is occupied by body, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,2), L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3).\n\n(1,2) and (2,3) are possible? (1,2): y=2, not wall, not occupied? Positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., so (1,2) free? (1,2) not in positions, and not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is within bounds.\n\nBut y=0 is wall, so (1,2) is ok.\n\nNow, if I go down to (1,2), that might lead to bottom, which has the tail or something.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nI need to get to the right side.\n\nPerhaps go right to (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go up or right, etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is at y=6, x=4, I'm at y=3, x=1.\n\nAlso, (4,4) at y=4,x=4.\n\nNow, the snake body is from (1,3) to (1,5) to (2,5) to (5,5) down to (5,2).\n\nSo the area around (1,3) to (5,2) is partially occupied.\n\nSpecifically, row y=5 has (1,5) to (5,5), so occupied from x=1 to 5 at y=5.\n\ny=4 has (1,4) and (5,4), but (2,4),(3,4),(4,4) might be free, but (4,4) has food.\n\n(4,4) has food, but let's see if I can go there.\n\nFirst, from (1,3), after eating, direction down.\n\nI can move:\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Right to (2,3)\n\n- Left to (0,3) wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (1,4) occupied, invalid\n\nSo only down or right.\n\nNow, if I go down to (1,2), then head to (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen next turn, from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), or left to (0,2) wall, or right to (2,2).\n\nBut (1,1) might be ok, but then I'm going down, away from the food which is at higher y.\n\nFood at y=6 and y=4, I'm at y=2, so going down might not be good.\n\nBetter to go right to (2,3) on turn 34? Turn 33 I just ate, now turn 34.\n\nCurrent turn: turn 33 after eating, now turn 34.\n\nLet's keep track of turns.\n\nTurn 32: move to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33: move to (1,3), eat food\n\nNow, start of turn 34: positions as above, head at (1,3), direction down (since moved down to (1,3))\n\nOn turn 34, I need to move.\n\nOptions: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3)\n\nIf I go R to (2,3), then head to (2,3), direction right (since moved right).\n\nThen positions: new head (2,3), then body: (1,3) becomes neck, then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., tail at (5,2) but shifts.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) without eating (no food there), so positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) -- tail at (5,3)? Let's not list all.\n\nNow, from (2,3), direction right, I can move U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\nPossible: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3)\n\n(2,4): is it free? Positions: body has (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., not (2,4), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nNow, I need to go towards (4,6) or (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is close.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go right to (3,3), then to (4,3), then up to (4,4) to eat.\n\n(4,4) has food.\n\nLife span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is at y=6.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is wall.\n\nSo to reach (4,6), I need to go to (4,5) or (4,7), but y=7 wall, so from (4,5) or (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by the snake body currently? In the positions, (4,5) is a body segment.\n\nAfter turn 34 move to (2,3), positions include (4,5) as body.\n\nBut as I move, the body moves, so it might free up.\n\nI should plan a path to (4,4) since it's closer and has long life.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), I am at (2,3) after moving.\n\nPath: from (2,3) to (4,4): I can go right to (3,3), then up to (3,4), then right to (4,4)? (3,4) to (4,4).\n\n(3,4) is free? Currently, after turn 34, positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) -- so (3,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has food.\n\nSo possible.\n\nOn turn 34, if I go right to (2,3), then turn 35: from (2,3) direction right, move to (3,3) (right).\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) -- tail at (5,4)? Approximately.\n\nNow, direction right.\n\nThen turn 36: move to (4,3)? Or up to (3,4), etc.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), so from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), then right to (4,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, as above.\n\nThen turn 36: move to (3,4), direction up.\n\nThen turn 37: move to (4,4), eat food.\n\n(4,4) life span until turn 40, so on turn 37 it's still there.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly, but (3,3) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nNow, what about the other food (4,6)? It has life until turn 37, so on turn 37 it might be eaten if I go there.\n\nBut if I eat (4,4) on turn 37, (4,6) might disappear after turn 37? Life span 6 from turn 32, so present turns 32 to 37, disappears before turn 38.\n\nSo on turn 37, it is still present, but after turn 37, gone.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) on turn 37, I can't eat (4,6) on the same turn, so I might miss it.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), which is above, and obstacle at (3,6).\n\nTo reach (4,6) from current position.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), I am at (1,3) on turn 34.\n\nInstead of going right, I could go up or something, but I have to go down or right from (1,3).\n\nSuppose on turn 34, I go down to (1,2) instead of right.\n\nThen head to (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 35: from (1,2), move to (1,1) or right to (2,2), etc., but then I'm going away, and it might take longer to reach the food, and I might miss (4,6) which has shorter life.\n\n(4,6) life until turn 37, so I need to eat by turn 37.\n\nIf I go down to (1,2) on turn 34, then I need to go right and up, but it might be tight.\n\nFor example, turn 34: move to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 35: move to (2,2) or (1,1)\n\nSay go right to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 36: to (3,2) or (2,3), etc.\n\nThen to (4,6) I need to go up to y=6.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied? Not necessarily, but (3,6) is wall, so to (4,6), I need to go to (4,5) or (5,6), but (4,5) might be occupied initially.\n\nBut as I move, it might free.\n\nBut it seems longer path.\n\nFor instance, from (2,2) on turn 36, go to (3,2), then turn 37 to (4,2), but (4,2) is far from (4,6).\n\nNot reaching by turn 37.\n\nFrom (2,2) go up to (2,3), then turn 37 to (3,3), still not at (4,6).\n\nTo reach (4,6) from (1,3) by turn 37.\n\nTurn 34: at (1,3)\n\nTurn 35: need to be closer\n\nTurn 36: closer\n\nTurn 37: eat at (4,6)\n\nSo in 3 moves from (1,3) to (4,6).\n\nDistance: dx=3, dy=3, but Manhattan distance |4-1| + |6-3| = 3+3=6, so minimum 6 moves? No, Manhattan distance is the number of moves, but I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves.\n\nEach move changes x or y by 1, so from (1,3) to (4,6) requires at least |4-1| + |6-3| = 3+3=6 moves.\n\nBut I have only from turn 34 to 37, that's 4 moves: turn 34,35,36,37.\n\nTurn 34,35,36,37: 4 moves.\n\nBut min distance is 6 moves, impossible to reach by turn 37.\n\n|4-1| =3, |6-3|=3, total 6 moves.\n\nTurns: on turn 34 I move, to some position, then 35, 36, 37.\n\nAfter 4 moves, I can be at most 4 steps closer, but since min steps are 6, I cannot reach (4,6) from (1,3) in 4 moves; I need 6 moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 34: move to (2,3)  // dy=0, dx=+1\n\nTurn 35: to (3,3)     // dx+1\n\nTurn 36: to (3,4)     // dy+1\n\nTurn 37: to (4,4)     // dx+1, but (4,6) is at y=6, I'm at y=4, still need 2 more moves up.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, I am at (4,4), but (4,6) is at (4,6), not reached.\n\nTo reach (4,6) on turn 37, I need to be adjacent on turn 36.\n\nBut from (1,3), even in best case, after 3 moves (turn 34,35,36), I can be at, say, (4,3) or (3,6) but (3,6) wall, or (4,4), etc., but (4,6) is not reachable in 3 moves.\n\nAfter 3 moves: max dx+dy=3, from (1,3) to (4,6) dx+dy=6>3, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, in 4 moves, max dx+dy=4, but 6>4, still impossible.\n\ndx+dy= |Δx| + |Δy| =3+3=6, so min moves required 6.\n\nBut from turn 34 to turn 37, I have 4 moves: at turn 34 start, I move to new position on turn 34, then turn 35, 36, 37.\n\nSo positions after moves: after turn 34 move, at new cell; after turn 35, at new; turn 36; turn 37.\n\nSo I can reach a cell in 4 moves, but (4,6) requires 6 moves, so I cannot reach it by turn 37.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (4,6) from this position; it will disappear after turn 37.\n\nSo I should not worry about (4,6); focus on (4,4) which has longer life.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (1,3), I can go for (4,4).\n\nNow back to turn 34 decision.\n\nAt turn 34 start: head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nOptions: move down to (1,2) or right to (2,3)\n\nIf I move down to (1,2), I might get stuck in the bottom or something, but let's see.\n\n(1,2) is free, then I can go to (1,1), etc., but the food is at (4,4), which is up and right.\n\nGoing down might not be efficient.\n\nBetter to go right to (2,3) to head towards (4,4).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), then to (3,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nTo eat (4,4), I need to be adjacent.\n\nAlso, check if (4,4) is under body or something, but it's food, so should be free, but when I move, I need to ensure I can reach it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to output actions for turn 32, 33, etc., but I need to specify for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions starting from turn t1=32.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 32: I must go down to (1,4), as going up is deadly.\n\nThen turn 33: go down to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nNow turn 34: from (1,3), go right to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 35: from (2,3), direction right (since moved right), so can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nNow, to reach (4,4), I can move up to (2,4) or right to (3,3) or down to (2,2).\n\n(2,4) is at y=4, which is closer to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at x=4,y=4.\n\n(2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go right to (3,4), then to (4,4).\n\n(3,4) should be free.\n\nAfter turn 34: positions: head at (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) -- let's list y=4: (1,4) and (5,4), so (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) are free except (4,4) has food.\n\n(4,4) has food, so not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, on turn 35, from (2,3), if I move up to (2,4), that is possible.\n\nThen direction up.\n\nThen turn 36: from (2,4), can move U, L, R (not D, reverse).\n\nU to (2,5), but (2,5) is body? After turn 35 move to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) -- so (2,5) is occupied.\n\nSo move U to (2,5) invalid.\n\nL to (1,4), occupied by body.\n\nR to (3,4), which is free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 36, move to (3,4), direction right.\n\nThen turn 37: from (3,4), can move U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\nU to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? After turn 36: positions head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) -- tail? (5,4) might be gone.\n\nAfter turn 36 move to (3,4): new head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) -- 10 segments, tail at (5,5)? Old positions: after turn 35, head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,4) without eating: new head (3,4), new body: (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) -- and (5,4) removed, tail at (5,5)\n\nNow, from (3,4), move to (4,4) on turn 37: (4,4) has food, so eat it.\n\nMove right to (4,4), eat, grow.\n\nThen done.\n\n(4,4) life until turn 40, so on turn 37 it's fine.\n\nNow, what about (4,6)? It disappears after turn 37, so I can't eat it.\n\nBut I have another food at (4,4), so it's ok.\n\nNow, back to turn 34, if I had gone down to (1,2), it might be worse.\n\nFor example, turn 34: move to (1,2)\n\nThen positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), etc., tail shifts.\n\nThen from (1,2), direction down, can move to (1,1) or (2,2) or left wall.\n\nSay go to (2,2) on turn 35.\n\nThen to (3,2) turn 36, then to (4,2) turn 37, but (4,2) is not food, and (4,4) is above, so I need to go up later, but I can still reach (4,4) since long life.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and I might have risks, like near walls.\n\nBut since no other food, and (4,4) is safe, but going right first is shorter path.\n\nSo better to go right on turn 34.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 32: move down to (1,4)\n\nTurn 33: move down to (1,3) and eat\n\nTurn 34: move right to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 35: from (2,3), move up to (2,4)? Earlier I said move up to (2,4) on turn 35.\n\nFrom (2,3) after turn 34, direction is right (since moved right on turn 34).\n\nOn turn 35, possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3)\n\nI said U to (2,4), which is valid.\n\nThen turn 36: from (2,4), only possible move R to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 37: from (3,4), move R to (4,4) and eat.\n\nIn turn 35, I could go directly to (3,3) instead of (2,4).\n\n(3,3) is at (3,3), then to (3,4) or (4,3), then to (4,4).\n\nFor example, turn 35: from (2,3) move right to (3,3)\n\nThen direction right.\n\nTurn 36: from (3,3), can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3)\n\nThen to (4,4), I can go U from (3,4) on turn 37, or from (4,3) go up.\n\nBut (3,4) to (4,4) is not adjacent directly; from (3,4) I can go right to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if I go to (3,3) on turn 35, then turn 36 to (3,4), turn 37 to (4,4).\n\nSame as before.\n\nGoing to (2,4) first might be similar.\n\nBut in the first path: turn 35 to (2,4), then turn 36 to (3,4), turn 37 to (4,4)\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 35, then turn 36 to (3,4), turn 37 to (4,4), same number of moves.\n\nBut from (2,3), going to (2,4) is up, which might be better if I want to avoid the bottom, but (2,4) is fine.\n\nI think both are ok.\n\nTo minimize moves or something, but since I need to output actions, I can choose one.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify actions for several turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the box, it should be like Turn 32: action, Turn 33: action, etc.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but I think for the immediate actions to reach a state.\n\nSince I planned to turn 37, I can output up to there.\n\nBut turn 37 is eating (4,4), which is good.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move safely.\n\nBut the grid might have space.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4), I am at (4,4), with direction right or something.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut since no food, score doesn't increase, so survival is key.\n\nBut for now, I think outputting until I eat the second food is fine.\n\nThe current turn is 32, I need to start from there.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 35, I have options, but I need to commit.\n\nLet's write the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 32: move down (D)\n\nTurn 33: move down (D) to eat (1,3)\n\nThen turn 34: move right (R) to (2,3)\n\nNow turn 35: I need to move. I can move up to (2,4) or right to (3,3)\n\nSay I move up to (2,4) for variety or to stay higher.\n\nMove up to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 36: from (2,4), must move right to (3,4) as only choice.\n\nThen turn 37: move right to (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut move right to (4,4) from (3,4), yes.\n\n(3,4) to (4,4) is right.\n\nNow, what about the direction: after turn 36 to (3,4), direction right.\n\nThen turn 37 move right to (4,4), direction right.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIf on turn 35 I move right to (3,3), then turn 36 move up to (3,4), then turn 37 move right to (4,4).\n\nAlso fine.\n\nI think either is ok.\n\nBut in the first choice, when I move to (2,4) on turn 35, from (2,3) to (2,4), I move up, which changes direction.\n\nThen to (3,4) right.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for the box, I need to list the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=32.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D  (to eat (1,3))\n\nTurn 34: R  (to (2,3))\n\nNow for turn 35: let's say U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 36: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 37: R to (4,4) and eat.\n\nBut turn 37 is the move to (4,4), eat.\n\nNow, I should include a few more turns for safety, but after that, no food, so I can stop or something.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is not eaten, but it expires soon.\n\nAfter turn 37, I can move around.\n\nBut since the instruction is to maximize score, and I ate two foods, from length 9 to 11, score +2.\n\nInitially length 9, eat (1,3) to 10, eat (4,4) to 11.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: (3,6), I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: not triggered, since I didn't eat near tail.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nBut I need to output for the current turn and subsequent, but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list multiple.\n\nSince t1=32, so up to turn 37 is 5 turns ahead? From 32 to 37 is 5 moves: 32,33,34,35,36,37? Turns: turn 32 action, then turn 33,34,35,36,37: that's 6 actions.\n\nBut thinking 5+ turns ahead, I have planned.\n\nTo be concise, I can output until turn 36 or so.\n\nBut in the box, I think list the actions.\n\nNow, for turn 35, I said U, but I could do R directly to (3,3).\n\nBut moving to (2,4) might be better because it gets to y=4, which is the row of the food.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo final sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 32) presents immediate risks and opportunities:\n\n- The snake head is at (1,5) with direction left (L), so reverse move (right) is invalid. Only up (U) or down (D) are possible.\n- Moving up to (1,6) leads to a dead end by turn 34 due to walls and body collisions, so it must be avoided.\n- Moving down to (1,4) is safe and allows eating the positive food at (1,3) on turn 33, which has a short life span (disappears after turn 35).\n- After eating (1,3), the snake should navigate toward (4,4) (life span 9, disappears after turn 40), as (4,6) (life span 6, disappears after turn 37) is unreachable within its life span from the post-eating position.\n- The path to (4,4) is planned via (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4), ensuring no collisions and efficient movement.\n\n### Key Risks Avoided:\n- **Turn 32 Up Move**: Leads to unavoidable death by turn 34.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not triggered, as no food is eaten adjacent to the tail.\n- **Collisions**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (3,6)), and body segments.\n- **Food Life Spans**: (1,3) is eaten just in time (turn 33); (4,4) is targeted with ample time.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 32-37):\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (1,4) – avoids death and positions to eat (1,3).\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (1,3) – eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 10).\n- **Turn 34**: Move right (R) to (2,3) – begins path to (4,4), direction now right.\n- **Turn 35**: Move up (U) to (2,4) – avoids bottom area and aligns for efficient movement to (4,4), direction now up.\n- **Turn 36**: Move right (R) to (3,4) – approaches (4,4), direction now right.\n- **Turn 37**: Move right (R) to (4,4) – eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 11).\n\nThis sequence eats both accessible positive foods, increasing the score by 2, and ensures survival by avoiding all risks. Beyond turn 37, the snake should navigate safely in the open area (e.g., toward (0-3,0-7) avoiding walls/body), but no further food is present.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: D \\\\\nTurn 33: D \\\\\nTurn 34: R \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: R \\\\\nTurn 37: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6), which I must avoid.\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (1,4), then body segments at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So the snake is 9 segments long. The head is facing down, which is direction D. Since it's moving down, the previous move was downward.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,3) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 5 and value +1\n\n- (4,4) with life span 8 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so they all increase length by 1 when eaten.\n\nLife span: for (1,3), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 33, it has 3 turns left; on turn 34, it has 2; turn 35, 1; and gone by turn 36. Similarly, (4,6) has life span 5, so lasts until turn 37, and (4,4) has life span 8, lasts until turn 40.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are all walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (1,4)\n\n- Body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with a bend. From (1,4) down to (1,5), then right to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So the tail is at (5,2).\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,3) – above the head, since head is at (1,4), so (1,3) is directly above.\n\n- (4,6) – which is above the body segment at (4,5), but (4,6) might be accessible.\n\n- (4,4) – which is left of (5,4), but (4,4) has food, and (5,4) is a body segment? Let's see: snake has (5,5), (5,4), so (5,4) is occupied. But food at (4,4), which is adjacent.\n\n(4,4) is not occupied by snake currently? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So (4,4) is free, but has food with life span 8.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is free, above (4,5), and (1,3) is free above head.\n\nHead direction is down, meaning last move was down to (1,4) from (1,5)? Positions: head at (1,4), then (1,5). Since head is first, and it was moving down to (1,4), so from previous position, it came from (1,5) to (1,4), so it moved down. But now head is at (1,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: I can move up, down, left, right, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: since current direction is down, I cannot move up immediately, because that would be reverse. So I cannot move U (up) on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: L (left to (0,4)? But x=0 is wall, so left is invalid. Let's see adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Up: (1,3) – y=3, which is within 1 to 6? Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No:\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? For example, (1,1) is valid if not wall, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nLet's read: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall. Internal obstacle (3,6).\n\nSo for (1,4): x=1, y=4.\n\n- Up: (1,3) – x=1,y=3, not border, not obstacle, so valid? But (1,3) has food, but we need to check if it's safe.\n\n- Down: (1,5) – but (1,5) is occupied by the body, the second segment. So if I move down to (1,5), I collide with body, die. So invalid.\n\n- Left: (0,4) – x=0, which is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right: (2,4) – x=2,y=4, not border, not obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all listed, (2,4) not in list, so free? Snake: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc. (2,4) is not occupied, so right is possible.\n\nSo from (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,3) – valid and has food\n\n- R: to (2,4) – valid, no food\n\nD and L invalid as above.\n\nBut I cannot move U because of no instant reverse? Current head direction is D, down. Moving up would be opposite direction, so I cannot move up on the next turn.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U this turn.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is R (right) to (2,4).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nAvailable moves from (1,4):\n\n- U: (1,3) – but reverse move, not allowed because current direction D.\n\n- D: (1,5) – occupied by body, invalid.\n\n- L: (0,4) – wall, invalid.\n\n- R: (2,4) – free and valid.\n\nSo only R is possible? But that seems restrictive.\n\nPerhaps I misremembered the direction.\n\nSnake head direction is given as D, meaning it is facing down, so last move was down. Therefore, moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nBut let's double-check the positions: snake positions [(1,4), (1,5), ...] so head at (1,4), and it came from (1,5) by moving down to (1,4). So yes, moving down.\n\nSo for turn 33, I can only move right to (2,4). No other choice.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead. Maybe I can plan a path.\n\nFirst, for turn 33, action must be R, since only choice.\n\nThen, after moving to (2,4), what can I do next?\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 33: move R to (2,4). Now head at (2,4), direction R (since I moved right).\n\nSnake positions: after move, the head moves to (2,4), and the tail moves forward? When I move, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment to previous position, tail is removed unless I eat food.\n\nSince I didn't eat food ( (2,4) has no food, I assume), so snake length remains 9, tail at (5,2) is removed, so new positions: head (2,4), then body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). Tail was (5,2), gone.\n\nOriginal positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,4), and not eating, so new body: the first body segment goes to where head was, (1,4), then next to (1,5), then (2,5), and so on, up to (5,4), and the tail (5,2) is gone, so (5,3) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: old head (1,4)\n\n- Segment 2: old segment 1 (1,5)\n\n- Segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4: old segment 3 (3,5)\n\n- Segment 5: old segment 4 (4,5)\n\n- Segment 6: old segment 5 (5,5)\n\n- Segment 7: old segment 6 (5,4)\n\n- Segment 8: old segment 7 (5,3)  // since (5,3) was segment 8, now segment 8\n\nOld segments: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2)\n\nAfter move to (2,4) without eating:\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (1,4)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (1,5)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 (3,5)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 (5,3)  // (5,2) is removed\n\nSo positions now: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nNow, head at (2,4), direction R.\n\nNow for turn 34, possible moves.\n\nCurrent head direction R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- U: (2,3) – y=3, not border, not obstacle, not occupied? Snake: (2,4) head, (1,4), (1,5), etc. (2,3) not in list, so free.\n\n- D: (2,5) – but (2,5) is occupied by body, segment 4? New positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), so (2,5) is segment 3, occupied. So moving down to (2,5) collides with body, invalid.\n\n- L: (1,4) – but (1,4) is occupied by segment 1, body, invalid. Also, left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, moving left would be opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\n- R: (3,4) – x=3,y=4, not border, not obstacle (obstacle at (3,6), different), not occupied? Snake positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\nNow, food: (1,3) is at (1,3), which is above the old head position, but now (1,4) is body, so (1,3) might be accessible later.\n\nAlso (4,6) and (4,4).\n\n(4,4) has food, life span 8.\n\nI need to think about eating food.\n\nBut first, let's plan the path.\n\nSince I have to move on turn 33 to (2,4), then on turn 34, I can go U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,3), or R to (3,4).\n\nNow, (2,3) has no food, (3,4) has no food.\n\nBut I can head towards food.\n\nFor example, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is adjacent to (1,4), but (1,4) is now body segment.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need the head to move to (1,3), but that requires the body to move away from (1,3) first, but (1,3) is not occupied by body, it's free with food.\n\n(1,3) is a cell with food, and currently not occupied by snake.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I move U to (2,3), I'm at (2,3), then I could move left to (1,3) to eat the food, but need to see if that's possible.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFood at (1,3) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 35? Let's see life span.\n\nLife span given at turn 33: for (1,3) life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, meaning on turn 36 it's gone. So available on turn 33,34,35.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 5, available turns 33 to 37.\n\n(4,4) life span 8, available turns 33 to 40.\n\nNow, back to turn 34 options.\n\nAfter turn 33, head at (2,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 34:\n\nOption A: Move U to (2,3)\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction U.\n\nNow positions: head (2,3), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail (5,3) removed? After move to (2,3) without eating.\n\nOriginal after turn 33: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nMove U to (2,3): not eating, so new head (2,3), new segment 1: old head (2,4), segment 2: old seg1 (1,4), segment 3: old seg2 (1,5), segment 4: old seg3 (2,5), segment 5: old seg4 (3,5), segment 6: old seg5 (4,5), segment 7: old seg6 (5,5), segment 8: old seg7 (5,4)  // (5,3) removed\n\nSo positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nNow from (2,3), possible moves: direction U.\n\nCannot move down (opposite).\n\n- U: (2,2) – y=2, not wall, not occupied? Free.\n\n- D: (2,4) – occupied by body segment 1, invalid.\n\n- L: (1,3) – not occupied, has food? (1,3) has food, and not occupied now.\n\n- R: (3,3) – free, I assume.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), I eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n\nThen snake grows: after eating, tail doesn't move, so new length 10.\n\nBut check tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (1,3). (1,3) and (5,4) are far, so no danger.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3), head at (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc., with tail at (5,4) or something.\n\nBut life span of (1,3) is 3, so on turn 34, if I eat it, it's turn 34, life span was 3 at turn 33, so on turn 34 it has 2 left, but when I eat, it's consumed.\n\nNow, back to turn 34 choice.\n\nIf on turn 34 I move U to (2,3), then on turn 35 I can move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nBut turn 35 is within life span.\n\nOption B: on turn 34, move R to (3,4) instead.\n\nFrom (2,4), move R to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // (5,3) removed\n\n(3,5) is body, so from (3,4), possible moves.\n\nDirection R, cannot move left.\n\n- U: (3,3) – free\n\n- D: (3,5) – occupied, invalid\n\n- L: (2,4) – occupied, invalid, and opposite? Current direction R, left is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- R: (4,4) – (4,4) has food, and not occupied? Snake has (4,5), (5,5), etc., not (4,4), so free.\n\nSo I can move R to (4,4) and eat the food there.\n\n(4,4) has value +1, life span 8.\n\nSo on turn 34, if I move R to (3,4), then I can go to (4,4) on turn 35? Not immediately.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move U to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), I eat the food at (4,4).\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nFirst, for turn 33, I must move R to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 34, I have two choices: U to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I go U to (2,3), I can then go to (1,3) on turn 35 to eat that food.\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), I can then go to (4,4) on turn 35 to eat that food, or to (3,3) etc.\n\n(1,3) food has shorter life span, only available for 3 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\n(4,4) has longer life span, so less urgent.\n\n(4,6) is also there.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4), the snake body is around.\n\nI need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, there's an obstacle at (3,6).\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0-7, y 0-7, walls at borders, so playable area x1-6, y1-6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls.\n\nFor example, (1,1) to (6,6) playable? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,1) is not wall, yes.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions turn 33: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nAfter move to (2,4) on turn 33: positions as above [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] tail at (5,3)\n\nNow, food: (1,3) at (1,3), (4,6) at (4,6), (4,4) at (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is free.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 34, then to (1,3) on turn 35 to eat.\n\nBut when I eat at (1,3), I grow, so the tail doesn't move, and I have a longer body.\n\nBut the area around (1,3) might be tight.\n\n(1,3) is at top-left, with walls at x=0 and y=0 nearby.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3), head at (1,3), body at (2,3), (2,4), etc.\n\nThen from (1,3), possible moves: direction L (since I moved left to (1,3)? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (1,3):\n\n- U: (1,2) - free? y=2, not wall\n\n- D: (1,4) - but (1,4) is body, occupied\n\n- L: (0,3) - wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,3) - occupied by body\n\nCannot move down or right, both occupied; left wall; so only up to (1,2).\n\nSo I must move U to (1,2).\n\nThen at (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,1), D to (1,3) occupied, L wall, R to (2,2).\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (1,1), then from (1,1): U to (1,0) wall, D to (1,2) occupied, L wall, R to (2,1). So only R to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nBut this might lead to a dead end if not careful.\n\nThe tail is at (5,4) or moving, but it's far, so I have space.\n\nBut in the top-left, with walls, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,1), then to (2,1), then I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nBut let's see the body: the body is from (1,3) down to (1,4), (2,4), etc., so (1,3) is head, (2,3) body, so (1,2) is head after move, (1,3) body, so I cannot go down to (1,3).\n\nBut I can go right to (2,2) or up to (1,1), but (1,1) is corner, dangerous.\n\nBetter to go right from (1,2) to (2,2), then down or right.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nIf I eat (1,3) on turn 35, I might be stuck in the corner for a bit.\n\nNow, alternative: on turn 34, from (2,4) move R to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), direction R.\n\nThen I can move U to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) on turn 35, I eat the food at (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is more central, less risky.\n\nAlso, (4,6) is above, which I might go for later.\n\nMoreover, (1,3) food will disappear soon, but if I don't eat it, no big deal, since it's only +1, and I can eat others.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nEating (1,3) might lead me to a tight spot, while eating (4,4) is safer.\n\nBut let's see the path to (4,4).\n\nFrom (2,4) turn 34 move R to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 35, I can move R to (4,4) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // no tail removal, so positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // since ate, tail stays, so (5,4) is still there, length 10.\n\nOriginal after turn 33: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nAfter move to (3,4) on turn 34 without eating: new head (3,4), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // (5,3) removed\n\nThen on turn 35, move R to (4,4), which has food, so eat. Then new head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail (5,4) not removed, so segments: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (1,4), seg4 (1,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (3,5), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4)\n\nNow from (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move left (opposite).\n\n- U: (4,3) - free?\n\n- D: (4,5) - occupied by body, seg7, invalid\n\n- L: (3,4) - occupied, invalid\n\n- R: (5,4) - occupied by tail, seg9? (5,4) is tail, but I can move there? Rule: I can move to tail cell because tail will move away, but only if I don't eat or something.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nHere, (5,4) is the tail, so if I move to (5,4), since tail will move, it might be ok, but I need to see the next move.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), which is currently tail, but after move, if I don't eat, tail moves away, so head to (5,4), which was tail, but now it's head, and tail moves from (5,4) to... but in this case, if I move to (5,4), and (5,4) has no food, so I move to (5,4), tail is removed, so no collision.\n\nBut (5,4) is occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move there.\n\nRule: \"the snake can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut here, (5,4) has no food, so if I move to (5,4), I don't eat, so tail is removed, and head at (5,4), body shifts.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,4), moving R to (5,4) is possible since it's tail.\n\nBut (5,4) is the current tail position, and I can move there.\n\nMoreover, (4,3) up is free.\n\nBut direction R, so from (4,4), I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,5) down is occupied, L is occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI also have (4,6) food to consider.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is above (4,5), but (4,5) is body segment.\n\nTo eat (4,6), I need to move to (4,6) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), I can go up to (4,3) or right to (5,4), then to (5,3) or (6,4), etc.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), y=6, which is not wall? y=7 wall, y=6 is playable, but there is obstacle at (3,6), but (4,6) is different cell.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, (4,6) is free with food.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), from say (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by body, so I need to move away and come back.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I can go up to (4,3), then left or right, then later to (4,4) or (5,4), but (4,4) is now body if I moved away.\n\nLet's think long-term.\n\nPerhaps for now, on turn 34, it's better to move R to (3,4) to set up for eating (4,4) on turn 35.\n\nThen (1,3) food will disappear soon, but since I might not be able to eat it safely, better to ignore it and go for the safer food.\n\nMoreover, (1,3) has low life span, so if I don't eat it by turn 35, it's gone.\n\nBut on turn 35, if I'm at (3,4), I can go to (4,4) to eat, not to (1,3).\n\nIf I had gone to (2,3) on turn 34, I could eat (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), I'm at (1,3), then must go up to (1,2), then to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go to (2,2), then I can go down to (2,3) or right to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) might be body or not.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3) on turn 35, positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // since grew, tail at (5,4)\n\nThen move U to (1,2), head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc.\n\nThen from (1,2), move R to (2,2), for example.\n\nThen at (2,2), I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (2,3) but (2,3) occupied.\n\n(2,3) is body, so not.\n\nSo U to (2,1), D to (2,3) occupied, L to (1,2) occupied, R to (3,2).\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf U to (2,1), then similar corner issue.\n\nBetter to go R to (3,2), then down to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it takes time to get out, and I might be wasting moves.\n\nWhereas if I eat (4,4), I'm in the center, can go to (4,3) or (5,4), then to (5,3), (5,2) is free? (5,2) was tail earlier, but now it's free.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4) on turn 35, head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nNow (4,3) is free, (5,4) is tail, can move there.\n\n(3,4) is body, (4,5) body.\n\nSo I can go U to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf go U to (4,3), then from there, I can go to (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3), etc.\n\nOr go to (4,6) later.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), life span 5, so available until turn 37.\n\nOn turn 35, it has life span 5 - (35-33) = 3? Turn 33 life span 5, so available turns 33,34,35,36,37. Gone turn 38.\n\nTurn 35 is ok.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), I need to be at (4,5) or adjacent, but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nSo I need to move the snake so that (4,5) is vacated.\n\nFor example, if I go from (4,4) to (4,3) on turn 36, then I'm at (4,3), body shifts, so (4,4) becomes body, (3,4) body, etc.\n\nThen (4,5) is still occupied? Positions after move to (4,3) without eating: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail (5,4) removed? After eating at (4,4), length 10, tail at (5,4).\n\nAfter turn 35: positions with head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nOn turn 36, move U to (4,3), no food, so head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail (5,4) removed\n\nNow (4,5) is still body, (4,6) is above, but to eat (4,6), I need head at (4,6), which requires moving to it.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc., not directly to (4,6).\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, go right to (5,3), then down to (5,4), but (5,4) might be free or not.\n\nAfter above, (5,4) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nBut (5,4) has no food.\n\nThen to (5,5), which is body? Positions: (4,3) head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail.\n\nSo from (4,3), move R to (5,3)? (5,3) is free? Not occupied, so yes.\n\nThen at (5,3), then to (5,4) or (6,3), etc.\n\nBut to get to (4,6), I could go to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo (4,6) can be accessed from (4,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) blocked, or (5,6), or (4,7) but y=7 wall, so only from left, right, or below.\n\nFrom below: (4,5) or from sides (3,6) blocked, (5,6) possible.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by body.\n\nIn the positions above, (4,5) is occupied until I move the snake.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,3) to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (5,5), but (5,5) is tail, can move there.\n\nMove to (5,5), then head at (5,5), body (5,3)? After move to (5,3) from (4,3): head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed? No.\n\nAfter turn 36: positions [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nMove to (5,3) on turn 37: not eating, so head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed\n\nThen from (5,3), move to (5,4), head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nThen to (5,5), but (5,5) is free now? After removing tail, (5,5) is free, so move to (5,5), then at (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) is free, then to (4,6) from (5,6) or from (5,5) to (4,5) but (4,5) might be body.\n\nBut it's messy, and (4,6) life span only until turn 37, so on turn 37, if I'm at (5,4), I can go to (5,5) or (5,3), not directly to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go up to (5,3), down to (5,5), left to (4,4) occupied, right to (6,4).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to (5,4), so I need to be at (4,5) or (3,6) blocked or (5,6) or (4,7) invalid.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can go to (5,5), then to (5,6) or (4,5) if free, but (4,5) is body.\n\nOn turn 37, positions: let's say on turn 37 I'm at (5,4), then move to (5,5), which is free, head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), since y=6 is not wall.\n\n(5,6) free, then to (5,6), then I can move left to (4,6) to eat, if life span allows.\n\nOn turn 37, (4,6) life span: at turn 33 life span 5, so available turn 33 to 37, so on turn 37 it is available, turn 38 gone.\n\nTurn 37 move to (5,6), then turn 38 move to (4,6) to eat, but on turn 38 it might be gone? Life span 5, disappears after 5 turns, so on turn 33,34,35,36,37 it exists, gone on turn 38.\n\nSo on turn 38, it is not there.\n\nTurn 37 is the last chance to eat (4,6).\n\nIf on turn 37 I move to (5,6), I can eat on turn 38? No, on turn 37 I can move to (4,6) from somewhere.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 37, if I move directly to (4,6)? (4,6) is adjacent to (5,5)? (5,5) to (4,6) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent are up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), D to (5,4), R to (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (5,5); to reach (4,6), I need to be at (4,5), (5,6), or (3,6) blocked, or (4,7) invalid.\n\nSo from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), then from (5,6) move L to (4,6).\n\nBut on turn 37, I move to (5,6), then on turn 38 to (4,6), but on turn 38, (4,6) is gone, since life span ended after turn 37.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,6) on turn 38; last chance turn 37.\n\nTherefore, to eat (4,6), I must be on a cell adjacent to it on turn 37 and move to it on turn 37.\n\nPossible adjacent cells: (4,5), (3,6) blocked, (5,6), (4,7) invalid. So only (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is usually occupied by body, so difficult to reach, or (5,6) might be free.\n\nBut to be at (5,6) on turn 37, I need to plan.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,3), last chance turn 35.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 33.\n\nFor turn 33, I must move R to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 34, I need to decide between U to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3) on turn 34, I can eat (1,3) on turn 35.\n\nBut after that, I might be in a corner.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4) on turn 34, I can eat (4,4) on turn 35.\n\nThen from there, I can try to eat (4,6) but it's tight.\n\n(4,6) life span until turn 37, so I have turns 36 and 37 to position for it.\n\nOn turn 35, after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move U to (4,3) on turn 36, then on turn 36, head at (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,6) by turn 37, for example.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 36, move to (5,3) for example, then on turn 37 to (5,4) or (5,2), not to (5,6) directly.\n\nFrom (4,3) I can move to (4,4) but occupied, or to (3,3), then to (3,4) occupied, etc.\n\nIt's difficult to reach a position to eat (4,6) on turn 37.\n\nPerhaps it's not worth it for one food, especially since I have (4,4) which is easier.\n\nMoreover, long-term survival: the snake is long, 9 segments, so I need space to move.\n\nThe top-left corner is risky, while the center is better.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,4) with long life span, so I can eat it later, but on turn 35 I can eat it if I go that way.\n\nBut if I don't go for (1,3), I can avoid the corner.\n\nSo for turn 34, I should move R to (3,4) to set up for (4,4).\n\nThen for turn 35, move R to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,3) to explore the bottom area, or R to (5,4) to go right.\n\nSince the grid has walls, I should avoid the top for now.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (4,4), I can go down or left, but left is occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), move U to (4,3), then to (4,2), (5,3), etc., or move R to (5,4), then to (5,3) or (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is free, (5,2) free, etc.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so space opens up.\n\nFor example, the body at (1,4), (1,5) etc. will move as the snake moves.\n\nSo over time, the left side will be free.\n\nSo I can go to the right or down.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the actions.\n\nTurn 33: only choice, move R to (2,4)\n\nTurn 34: I think move R to (3,4) is better than U to (2,3), to avoid the corner and go for central food.\n\nThen turn 35: move R to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nNow, for turn 36, from (4,4), direction R, I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is free, (5,4) is tail, can move there.\n\nMoving to (5,4) is safe since it's tail.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), then head at (5,4), body shifts, and since I didn't eat, tail is removed, so positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed? After turn 35: positions with head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nMove to (5,4) on turn 36: (5,4) is current tail, so move to it, no food, so head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)  // but (5,5) is still there, and tail is removed? When I move head to (5,4), which was tail, the tail segment is removed, and body shifts.\n\nNew head (5,4), new segment 1: old head (4,4), segment 2: old seg1 (3,4), ..., segment 9: old seg8 (4,5), and old seg9 (5,5) is removed since no eat.\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]  // length 9, tail at (4,5)\n\n(5,5) removed.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,3), (5,5), (6,4), etc.\n\n(5,5) is now free, so I can go there.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (4,3) from (4,4) on turn 36.\n\nThen at (4,3), I can go to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nFor long-term, I should think about the available space.\n\nSince I need to output multiple turns, but I don't have to specify all, but at least 5 turns ahead in thinking, but output for a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut for output, I can do for, say, 5 turns or as needed.\n\nSince the state might change after each move, I should output actions step by step, but for the plan, I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps for now, output the actions for the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nTurn 33: move R (only choice)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (3,4)  // to go towards (4,4)\n\nThen turn 35: move R to (4,4) to eat\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nLet's choose U to (4,3) to go down, away from the obstacle.\n\n(4,3) is down, y=3.\n\nGrid y=0 bottom, y=7 top? In the positions, y=5,4,3 decreasing, so y=3 is below.\n\nIn coordinates, usually y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in movement, U is y+1, so up.\n\nIn the state, head direction D, down, so y decreasing? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., and head at (1,4) moving to (1,5)? No, head at (1,4), direction D, so moving down, to lower y.\n\nIn the list, (1,4) to (1,5), y from 4 to 5, which is up if y increases up.\n\nIn the input: \"U(x,y+1)\", so y+1 is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn positions, (1,4) to (1,5) is moving to higher y, which is up, but direction is D? Contradiction.\n\nHead direction D, down.\n\nPositions: [(1,4), (1,5), ...] so from (1,5) to (1,4), y from 5 to 4, decrease, so down to lower y.\n\nYes, so y=4 to y=3 is down, y=5 to y=6 is up.\n\nFood at (1,3), y=3, which is below (1,4).\n\n(4,6) y=6, high, (4,4) y=4.\n\nInternal obstacle (3,6), y=6.\n\nFor turn 36, from (4,4), moving U to (4,3) is down to y=3.\n\nThen to (4,2), etc.\n\nMoving R to (5,4) to the right.\n\nSince the left side has the body, moving right might open space.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nTo be safe, move U to (4,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen for turn 37, from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nI think for the output, I can specify up to turn 35 or 36.\n\nBut let's see the thinking ahead.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,3) will disappear after turn 35, so if I don't eat it, it's gone.\n\nBut with the move to (3,4) on turn 34, I'm not going for it, so I miss it.\n\nBut it's only one point, and I can eat (4,4) instead.\n\nPrioritize survival, so avoiding corner is better.\n\nSo decision: turn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R to eat (4,4)\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), move U to (4,3)\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=33.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nThen turn 36: U or something.\n\nBut I can stop at turn 35, but the thinking should be 5+ turns, so for turn 36 and 37.\n\nSince after turn 35, the state changes, I can just plan the initial moves.\n\nBut to be complete, let's output for 3 turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do for as many as I want, but at least the immediate.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns.\n\nPerhaps output actions for t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 36, I have options.\n\nTo make it simple, for now, I'll output up to turn 35.\n\nBut let's include turn 36.\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (4,4), I move U to (4,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut no food urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) might be missed, but life span short, and hard to reach, so not worth the risk.\n\nSo I think the plan is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nFor turn 36, I can say U, but let's confirm if it's necessary.\n\nSince the user might expect multiple turns, I'll do up to turn 36 or 37.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can do:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 33: R  \nTurn 34: R  \nTurn 35: R  \n}  \n\nAnd that's the immediate plan.\n\nBut thinking ahead, after that, I would go down to (4,3), then to (4,2) or (5,3), to explore lower areas.\n\nBut for the output, this should be fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if I could have eaten (1,3).\n\nIf on turn 34 I move U to (2,3), then turn 35 move L to (1,3) to eat.\n\nThen turn 36 from (1,3) move U to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 37 from (1,2) move R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 35 I eat (1,3), but I'm at (1,3), and must go up, while in the other case, I eat (4,4) on turn 35, which is better position.\n\nAlso, (4,4) has same value, so no loss.\n\nMoreover, by going right, I avoid the corner.\n\nSo I think R,R,R is better.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 33 and Beyond\n\n**Current State Summary (Turn 33):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 due to border walls; internal obstacle at (3,6)).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Head at (1,4), direction down (D).\n  - Body segments: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] (length 9).\n  - After any move without eating, the tail (currently (5,2)) will be removed, and segments shift.\n- **Food** (all positive, value +1, length +1 if eaten):\n  - (1,3): Life span 3 (disappears after Turn 35; last chance to eat on Turn 35).\n  - (4,6): Life span 5 (disappears after Turn 37; last chance to eat on Turn 37).\n  - (4,4): Life span 8 (disappears after Turn 40; less urgent).\n- **Immediate Constraints**:\n  - Current head direction is down (D), so reverse move up (U) is not allowed on Turn 33.\n  - From head position (1,4):\n    - Up (U) to (1,3): Valid cell with food, but reverse move prohibited.\n    - Down (D) to (1,5): Occupied by body segment (1,5), collision risk, invalid.\n    - Left (L) to (0,4): Wall (x=0), invalid.\n    - Right (R) to (2,4): Valid, no food, safe.\n\n**Turn 33 Action: Only Possible Move is R (Right)**\n- Move R to (2,4) is forced due to constraints. No other options without collision or wall violation.\n- After move: Head at (2,4), direction R. New positions: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] (tail (5,2) removed, length 9).\n\n**5+ Turn Ahead Planning (Prioritizing Long-Term Survival and Score Maximization):**\n- **Key Risks and Opportunities**:\n  - **(1,3) Food**: Short life span (gone after Turn 35), but eating it requires moving into top-left corner, which risks trapping the snake due to walls and limited space. With a long snake (length 9), corner moves are dangerous. Sacrificing this +1 food is better for survival.\n  - **(4,6) Food**: Life span until Turn 37, but access is difficult—(4,5) is occupied, and (3,6) is an obstacle. Reaching it by Turn 37 requires a convoluted path with collision risks. Low priority due to high risk for +1 reward.\n  - **(4,4) Food**: Central location, long life span (until Turn 40), easy access from current path. Eating it adds length safely and keeps the snake in open areas for better maneuverability.\n- **Path Selection**:\n  - Turn 33: Move R to (2,4) (forced).\n  - Turn 34: From (2,4), possible moves are U to (2,3) or R to (3,4). Moving R to (3,4) is chosen to:\n    - Avoid the risky top-left corner (which would occur if moving toward (1,3)).\n    - Set up for eating (4,4) on Turn 35.\n    - Keep the snake centered for future flexibility.\n  - Turn 35: From (3,4), move R to (4,4) to eat the food. This gains +1 score and increases length to 10. Position is safe and central.\n  - Beyond Turn 35: After eating (4,4), move down (U, which decreases y to open space) to avoid body collisions and explore safer areas. (4,6) is not pursued due to access difficulty and low reward vs. risk.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: After Turn 35, the snake should move downward (e.g., to (4,3) or (5,4)) to navigate toward open cells (e.g., (4,2), (5,3)) as the tail moves, creating space. Avoid areas near walls or obstacles unless necessary. The grid has ample space in the bottom and right, so prioritize moves that maintain options for 5+ turns.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 33-36):**\n- **Turn 33**: Move R (right) to (2,4) – only safe option.\n- **Turn 34**: Move R (right) to (3,4) – avoids corner, sets up for (4,4).\n- **Turn 35**: Move R (right) to (4,4) – eat (4,4) food for +1 score and growth.\n- **Turn 36**: Move U (up, which decreases y) to (4,3) – moves downward to open space, away from body clusters. From here, future moves can explore (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3) safely.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by securing the high-value (4,4) food with minimal risk, avoids short-lived or dangerous foods, and ensures long-term survival by keeping the snake in central, navigable areas. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms that corner avoidance and central positioning provide more options for future food collection without traps.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: R  \nTurn 34: R  \nTurn 35: R  \nTurn 36: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments at (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is R (right), meaning it was moving right to get to (2,4).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 34, life span 2 means it will be gone after turn 35? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for food at (1,3) with life span 2 at turn 34:\n\n- Turn 34: life span 2 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 35: life span 1 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 36: gone? After N turns, so if spawned at turn T, it lasts from T to T+N-1? I need to be careful.\n\nThe state says \"life_span\" at current turn. So at turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will last, including current turn? The description says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo if life_span is L at turn t, it means:\n\n- At turn t: available, life_span = L\n\n- After turn t, life_span becomes L-1 for turn t+1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn T with life_span N. Then:\n\n- Turn T: life_span N\n\n- Turn T+1: life_span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn T + N - 1: life_span 1\n\n- After turn T + N - 1, it's gone, so not available on turn T + N.\n\nIn this case, for (1,3): at turn 34, life_span 2, so it will be available on turn 34 and 35, gone on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly for others:\n\n- (4,6): value 1, life_span 4, so available turns 34,35,36,37, gone turn 38.\n\n- (4,4): value 1, life_span 7, available turns 34 to 40.\n\n- (6,5): value 1, life_span 10, available turns 34 to 43.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food? No, the value is given as 1 for all, but it says \"value and life span\", and for negative food it would be -1. Here all are 1, so all positive food.\n\nBut let's confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\": (1,3,2,1) — I think the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? No, looking back: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it's (x,y), value, life_span.\n\nIn the input: \"(1, 3, 2, 1)\" — that might be a typo? It says: \"(1, 3, 2, 1)\" but should be ( (1,3), 1, 2 )? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 3, 2, 1) - (4, 6, 4, 1) - (4, 4, 7, 1) - (6, 5, 10, 1)\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Probably it's (x, y, life_span, value). For (1,3,2,1): x=1, y=3, life_span=2, value=1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6,4,1): x=4,y=6, life_span=4, value=1.\n\nAll value=1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,4), direction R. So it just moved right to (2,4). Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because L would be opposite to R? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) because that's opposite. I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right).\n\nNow, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo let's list the snake cells:\n\n- (2,4) head\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,3) tail\n\nNow, from head to tail: (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3)\n\nThe snake is moving, so when head moves, the body follows.\n\nHead direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (2,4). From previous position, it must have been at (1,4) or something? Positions: before moving to (2,4), head was at (1,4) at turn 33? But at turn 33, head was at (1,4), and it moved right to (2,4) for turn 34.\n\nSnake positions are given as of current turn, turn 34.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,3) - value 1, life 2\n\n- (4,6) - value 1, life 4\n\n- (4,4) - value 1, life 7\n\n- (6,5) - value 1, life 10\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, what are possible moves from current position (2,4) with direction R.\n\nPossible actions: U (up to (2,5)? y+1, so from (2,4) U to (2,5)\n\nD (down to (2,3))\n\nR (right to (3,4))\n\nL (left to (1,4)) but L is opposite to R, so cannot move L. No instant reverse.\n\nSo options: U, D, R.\n\nNow, check for collisions or dangers.\n\nFirst, U to (2,5): what is at (2,5)? From snake positions, (2,5) is a body segment. Is it occupied?\n\nSnake positions: (2,5) is the fourth segment, but when we move, the snake moves, so if head moves to a cell, it might collide if it's not the tail.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it collides and dies.\n\nIf it moves to the tail cell, it's ok, because tail moves, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, for move U to (2,5): (2,5) is currently occupied by a body segment. Which one? Snake: positions list: index 0: head (2,4), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is at index 3, which is not the tail. Tail is (5,3) at index 8.\n\nSo (2,5) is a body segment, not tail. If head moves to (2,5), it will collide with body and die. So U is invalid, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,3): is (2,3) occupied? Look at snake positions: no (2,3), so not occupied by body. Also, walls: y=0 to 7, but (2,3) is within bounds, not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,3). So (2,3) is empty? But there might be food, but that's fine.\n\n(2,3) is not listed in snake positions, so it should be free, unless it's a wall, but walls are borders and (3,6), so (2,3) should be free.\n\nR to (3,4): (3,4) is not in snake positions. Walls: x=3, y=4, not border, not (3,6), so should be free.\n\nBut (3,4) might have food, but we'll see.\n\nFirst, possible safe moves: D to (2,3) or R to (3,4). U is deadly.\n\nNow, food considerations.\n\nFood at (1,3), which is close. (1,3) is one cell left and down from head? Head at (2,4), (1,3) is left and down? x=1<2, y=3<4, so southwest, but we can only move orthogonally.\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (1,3), we need to go left then down, or down then left, but left is not possible now.\n\n(1,3) has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 35, meaning available only on turn 34 and 35.\n\nTurn 34: we are at turn 34, so we can eat it now or next turn.\n\nBut to eat it, we need to move head to (1,3).\n\nCurrently at (2,4), we can move D to (2,3), then from there, to (1,3) would require moving left to (1,3), but from (2,3), moving left to (1,3) is possible, but we need to consider the direction.\n\nFirst, if we move D to (2,3) now, turn 34.\n\nThen at turn 35, from (2,3), we can move L to (1,3) to eat the food.\n\nBut life span: at turn 34, food at (1,3) has life span 2, so on turn 35, it will have life span 1, still available, and after that gone.\n\nTurn 35: if we eat it on turn 35, it's ok.\n\nBut we need to check if moving to (1,3) is safe.\n\n(1,3) is not currently occupied, but let's see the snake body.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's plan moves.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,3) on turn 34.\n\nThen from (2,3), on turn 35, we can move to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nBut we need to see what happens.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), the snake body: head moves to (2,3), then body follows: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where head was, (2,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 34, positions: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nIf we move D to (2,3):\n\nNew head position: (2,3)\n\nThen body segments move: the first body segment (1,4) moves to previous head position (2,4)? No, in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nStandard snake: head moves to new position, then each segment takes the position of the previous one, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nBut when we eat food, we don't remove tail, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,3), which has no food (assuming), so we don't eat, so tail is removed.\n\nAfter move: head at (2,3), then body: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where? The positions shift: the new position list: head at (2,3), then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3) and no food eaten, the new positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] and tail (5,3) is removed.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0:(2,4), 1:(1,4), 2:(1,5), 3:(2,5), 4:(3,5), 5:(4,5), 6:(5,5), 7:(5,4), 8:(5,3)\n\nAfter move D to (2,3), no food, so new head: (2,3), then body: position 0 becomes new head position, and segments 1 to 8 become the new body, but since no food, we remove the last one, so new body from index 1 to 7, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,3), then the first body segment is the previous head (2,4), then (1,4), then (1,5), then (2,5), then (3,5), then (4,5), then (5,5), and (5,4) becomes the new tail? Since we removed the last one.\n\nList: new snake: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] and the (5,3) is gone.\n\nNumber of segments: original 9, after move no food, so 8 segments? Positions: 9 positions, after move, head new position, and body takes first 8 of previous, but including the previous head as first body.\n\nTypically: new head position, then the previous positions from index 0 to len-2, so excluding the tail.\n\nPrevious positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P8 (P0 head, P8 tail)\n\nAfter move to new head position H_new, no food eaten: new positions: [H_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P7] so length decreases by one? No.\n\nP0 to P8 are 9 positions.\n\nAfter move: new head H_new, then the body segments are P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7. P8 is discarded since no food.\n\nSo new positions: [H_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7] which is 9 positions? H_new and P0 to P7 is 1 + 8 = 9 positions, but P0 to P7 are 8 positions, plus H_new is 9, but P8 is discarded, so length same? No.\n\nP0 to P7 are positions 0 to 7, that's 8 segments including the old head? I'm confusing indices.\n\nBetter to think: the snake has segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S8 (tail).\n\nAfter moving to new position for head, if no food, S1 becomes new S1, but all shift.\n\nNew head position: new_S0 = H_new\n\nThen new_S1 = old_S0\n\nnew_S2 = old_S1\n\n...\n\nnew_S8 = old_S7? But if no food, the tail is removed, so we don't have new_S8.\n\nOriginal: 9 segments, indices 0 to 8.\n\nAfter move no food: new head at H_new, then segments new_i for i=1 to 8: new_i = old_{i-1} for i=1 to 8? Standard: new positions: [H_new, old_S0, old_S1, old_S2, ..., old_S7] so that's 9 positions, but old_S0 to old_S7 are 8 positions, plus H_new is 9, and old_S8 is discarded, so length decreases by one only if no food eaten. But in terms of positions, the number of cells occupied decreases only if no food, but when no food, the tail moves away, so the cell is free.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (2,3) no food, new positions: head (2,3), then (2,4) (which was old head), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and (5,3) is no longer occupied.\n\nSo new tail is (5,4).\n\nLength is now 9? Positions: 9 positions listed, but we discarded old tail, so it should be 8 segments.\n\nCount: new_S0: (2,3)\n\nnew_S1: (2,4)  // old S0\n\nnew_S2: (1,4)  // old S1\n\nnew_S3: (1,5)  // old S2\n\nnew_S4: (2,5)  // old S3\n\nnew_S5: (3,5)  // old S4\n\nnew_S6: (4,5)  // old S5\n\nnew_S7: (5,5)  // old S6\n\nnew_S8: (5,4)  // old S7, and old S8 (5,3) discarded.\n\nBut we have 9 positions here? new_S0 to new_S8 is 9 segments, but we discarded old S8, so it should be 8 segments. Mistake.\n\nOld positions: S0 to S8, 9 segments.\n\nAfter move no food: new head at H_new, then new body: the first body segment is at old S0 position, second at old S1, ..., up to the new tail at old S7 position. So new positions: [H_new, old_S0, old_S1, old_S2, old_S3, old_S4, old_S5, old_S6, old_S7] so that's 9 positions: H_new and old_S0 to old_S7, which are 9 cells, but old_S0 to old_S7 are 8 positions, plus H_new is 9, so length same as before? No, old_S0 to old_S7 is 8 segments (S0 to S7), and S8 is discarded.\n\nS0 to S7 are indices 0 to 7, that's 8 segments, but S0 is head, so body segments S1 to S8 are 8, but S0 to S7 is from head to body, not including tail S8.\n\nLet's list indices:\n\nOld: position i from 0 to 8: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8\n\nAfter move to new head H, no food eaten:\n\nNew positions: Q0 = H (new head)\n\nQ1 = P0 (old head, now body)\n\nQ2 = P1\n\nQ3 = P2\n\nQ4 = P3\n\nQ5 = P4\n\nQ6 = P5\n\nQ7 = P6\n\nQ8 = P7  // new tail\n\nP8 is discarded.\n\nSo new snake has 9 segments? Q0 to Q8 is 9, but P8 was discarded, so it was 9, now 9, but the tail moved, so the length is the same only if we eat food; otherwise, when no food, length decreases? No, in snake game, when no food, the length stays the same, but the tail moves forward, so the number of segments is the same, but the position changes.\n\nIn this case, old: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move no food: new head, and the first 8 of the old segments become the new body, with old P0 to P7 becoming Q1 to Q8, but Q1 to Q8 are 8 positions, plus Q0, so 9 segments. P8 is removed, but P8 was the tail, so we have the same number of segments, but the snake has moved.\n\nFor example, from old positions, after moving head to new position, the tail position is removed, so the snake occupies the new head and the old head to old second-to-last, so the number of segments is unchanged; it's just that the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn this case, for our snake, after moving to (2,3) no food, new positions: head (2,3), then old head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and (5,3) is free now.\n\nSo new tail is (5,4).\n\nLength still 9.\n\nIf we eat food, we keep the tail, so length increases.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nOn turn 34, move D to (2,3).\n\nThen at turn 35, from (2,3), we can move to (1,3) to eat the food there.\n\n(1,3) has food with value 1, positive.\n\nNow, is it safe to move to (1,3)?\n\n(1,3) is not occupied by body now, but after move on turn 34, the body is at [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nSo (1,3) is free, no body, not wall.\n\nBut when we move to (1,3), we eat food, so length increases.\n\nNew head at (1,3), and we don't remove the tail, so new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and tail remains (5,4)? No.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (1,3), then the body includes the previous positions without removing tail.\n\nSo new positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] and (5,4) is now body, tail is (5,5)? Let's see.\n\nPrevious after turn 34 move: positions Q: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] with head (2,3), tail (5,4)\n\nMove to (1,3) and eat food: new head at (1,3), then body: the previous positions from Q0 to Q8, but since food eaten, we keep the tail, so new positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] so 10 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is the tail, but it was also in the list.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, when we move to (1,3), the tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (1,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,3) and (5,4) are not adjacent; they are far apart. So no issue.\n\nBut we need to consider the future.\n\nAnother option: move R to (3,4) on turn 34.\n\n(3,4) is free, no food there, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and tail (5,3) discarded? After move no food: new head (3,4), then old head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and (5,3) gone. New tail (5,4).\n\nThen from there, we can go for other food.\n\nBut (1,3) food will be gone soon.\n\nLife span: (1,3) life span 2 at turn 34, so available turn 34 and 35. If we don't eat it on turn 34 or 35, it's gone.\n\nOn turn 34, if we move R to (3,4), we are not eating it, and on turn 35, from (3,4), we might not be able to reach (1,3) in one move, and it might be risky or not efficient.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nOther food: (4,6), (4,4), (6,5)\n\n(4,4) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\n(4,6) life span 4, (6,5) life span 10.\n\nNow, the snake is currently in the left part, head at (2,4).\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which is a wall.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid.\n\nSketch the grid:\n\ny=7: top, y=0 bottom? Usually y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be specified. In movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we cannot go to those cells.\n\nAlso, internal wall at (3,6).\n\nNow, snake positions:\n\nAt turn 34:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nFood at: (1,3), (4,6), (4,4), (6,5)\n\n(4,4) is close to the body.\n\n(4,4) has food, but let's see who is there.\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is not occupied, but (5,4) is body, (4,5) is body, etc.\n\n(4,4) is free, I think.\n\nSnake positions: no (4,4), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is free.\n\nBut (6,5) is near the right wall.\n\nNow, back to immediate move.\n\nI have two safe moves: D to (2,3) or R to (3,4)\n\nU to (2,5) is deadly, as (2,5) is body.\n\nL to (1,4) is invalid because opposite direction.\n\nNow, if I move D to (2,3), I can then go to (1,3) to eat on turn 35.\n\nBut let's see what happens after that.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3) on turn 35, snake is at (1,3) with length 10, tail at (5,4) or something.\n\nThen from (1,3), I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3): U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3), R to (2,3)\n\nBut L to (0,3): x=0 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nD to (1,2): y=2, not wall, but y=0 is wall, so (1,2) should be free.\n\nU to (1,4): (1,4) is body segment; after turn 35, if we ate at (1,3), positions include (1,4) as body, so moving U to (1,4) would collide.\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc.\n\n(1,4) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,4) or something.\n\nFrom earlier: after eating at (1,3) turn 35, positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nSo (1,4) is at index 3, which is body.\n\nIf from (1,3) move U to (1,4), it is occupied by body, collision.\n\nMove R to (2,3): (2,3) is also body, index 1, collision.\n\nMove D to (1,2): (1,2) is free, no wall or body.\n\nMove L to (0,3): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (1,3) is D to (1,2).\n\nThen snake is forced to go down.\n\nNow, (1,2) is free, no food, so move to (1,2), tail shortens or something.\n\nAfter move to (1,2), no food, new head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and tail (5,4) removed? New positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and (5,4) gone. New tail (5,5).\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., but it might be cornered, and the snake body is above, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), move D to (1,1), then to (1,0) but y=0 wall, so (1,0) invalid, so only to (2,1) or something, but it could lead to dead end.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (4,6) and (4,4), which are far, and I might not reach them easily from there.\n\nSo going to (1,3) might lead to a trap.\n\nIf on turn 34 I move D to (2,3), and then on turn 35, instead of moving to (1,3), I move somewhere else.\n\nFrom (2,3) at turn 35, after moving to (2,3) on turn 34.\n\nAfter turn 34 move D to (2,3) no food, positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nAt turn 35, from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), R to (3,3), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nU to (2,4): (2,4) is body segment (index 1), so collision.\n\nR to (3,3): (3,3) should be free, no body, not wall.\n\nD to (2,2): free.\n\nL to (1,3): has food, can eat.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), eat food, as before, then I end up at (1,3) with only down move possible, which might be bad.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nSay move R to (3,3) on turn 35.\n\nThen (3,3) no food, so new positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail (5,4) removed? New: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (4,3) or (3,2) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) food will be gone after turn 35, so if not eaten now, lost.\n\nBut since it's only +1, and we have other food, maybe it's not worth risking being trapped.\n\nNow, the other move option on turn 34: move R to (3,4).\n\nOn turn 34, move R to (3,4), no food there, so new positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail (5,3) gone. New tail (5,4).\n\nNow, from (3,4), direction was R to (3,4), so current direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), R to (4,4), L to (2,4) but L is opposite to R, so cannot.\n\nSo options: U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is body segment; in new positions, (3,5) is at index 5, body, so collision.\n\nD to (3,3): (3,3) should be free.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) has food, and it's free.\n\nSo safe moves: D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), I can eat the food at (4,4) immediately.\n\n(4,4) has value 1, positive.\n\nThen after eating, new positions: head at (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and tail remains, so length 10, tail at (5,4).\n\nNow, from (4,4), I can move to other places.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,6) and (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is above, but (3,6) is wall, so (4,6) is accessible.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nBut current direction: after moving R to (4,4), direction is R.\n\nSo no instant reverse, cannot move L to (3,4) because opposite.\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) is body segment; in positions, (4,5) is index 6 or something, body, so collision.\n\nD to (4,3): free.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is body segment, in positions after eating, (5,4) is tail? After eating at (4,4), positions: [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] so (5,4) is tail.\n\nIf move R to (5,4), it is tail, so no collision because tail moves.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here (5,4) has no food; the food was at (4,4), which we just ate.\n\n(5,4) is tail, no food there.\n\nMoving to (5,4) is safe because it's the tail.\n\nThen from there, we can continue.\n\nBut let's compare the two paths.\n\nFirst, if I go for (1,3), I might get stuck in the bottom left.\n\nIf I go for (4,4), I am more central and can access other food.\n\n(4,4) has life span 7, so I can eat it later, but since it's close, I can eat now.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) has life span 4, so I should eat it within 4 turns.\n\n(6,5) has life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nNow, another food: (4,6) at (4,6), which is above.\n\nFrom current position, if I move R to (3,4) on turn 34, then I can go to (4,4) or to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the head is adjacent to the tail? Tail is at (5,3), head at (2,4), not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y, diff 1.\n\n(2,4) and (5,3) not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, it might be.\n\nBut in this case, no immediate danger.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nIf I go down to (2,3), I might be forced to eat (1,3) and then stuck.\n\nIf I go right to (3,4), I can eat (4,4) soon or later.\n\nBut on turn 34, from (3,4), I can move to (4,4) on turn 35 if I want.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nOption A: Turn 34: D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 35: L to (1,3) to eat food. But after that, only D to (1,2), then turn 36: from (1,2), move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nSay move D to (1,1), then turn 37: to (1,0) invalid, so must move R to (2,1) or something, but (2,1) might be free.\n\nBut the body is at (1,4), (1,5), etc., so moving to (2,2) or (1,1) might be ok, but eventually, to get to other food, I need to go right or up, but the body is blocking, so I might not have space.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), if I move R to (2,2), then to (2,1) or (3,2), etc., but the area around (1,4) to (5,5) is occupied, so I have to go down and right, but y=0 wall, so limited space.\n\nThen I might not reach (4,6) in time; life span 4, turns 34,35,36,37 available.\n\nFrom turn 35, if I am at (1,3), then turn 36 at (1,2), turn 37 at (2,2) or (1,1), turn 38 at (2,1) or (2,2), etc. To reach (4,6), it's far, at least 5 moves away, and with body in the way, it might not be possible before turn 38.\n\n(4,6) available until turn 37 (since life span 4 at turn 34: turns 34,35,36,37, gone turn 38).\n\nIf I start from turn 35 at (1,3), to (4,6) is distance |4-1| + |6-3| = 3+3=6 moves, but with obstacles, might be more, and I need to be there by turn 37, so only 2 moves, impossible. From turn 35 position.\n\nIf on turn 35 I am at (1,3), then on turn 37 I can be at, say, (3,3) or something, not (4,6). So I would miss (4,6) food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is closer, but from (1,3) to (4,4) is 3 moves, but on turn 35 at (1,3), turn 36 I can be at (2,3) or (1,2), turn 37 at (3,3) or (2,3), not (4,4). Turn 38 at (4,4), but (4,4) life span 7, available until turn 40, so I can eat on turn 38.\n\nBut I might be able to get there.\n\nBut the point is, going to (1,3) puts me in a corner with limited mobility.\n\nNow, if I move R to (3,4) on turn 34.\n\nThen at turn 35, from (3,4), I can move to (4,4) to eat, or to (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,4) on turn 35, eat food.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nDirection to (4,4) was R, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (4,3), free.\n\nR to (5,4), which is tail, so safe.\n\nL to (3,4), but L opposite to R, invalid.\n\nSo moves: D or R.\n\nIf move R to (5,4), which is tail, no collision, and since no food there, tail moves, so new head (5,4), then body, and tail removed if no eat, but (5,4) has no food, so after move, new positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and (5,4) was head, but we move to (5,4), which was tail, but after moving, the cell is free.\n\nNew head at (5,4), then previous positions except tail removed: [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ] and (5,5) becomes new tail? Previous tail was (5,4), but we moved to it, so.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), no food, new head (5,4), then body: old (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and old tail gone? Old positions before move: head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nMove to (5,4): (5,4) was tail, so head moves to (5,4), and since no food, tail is removed, so new positions: [ (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ] and (5,5) is removed? New body from old head to old second-to-last.\n\nQ0: (5,4) new head\n\nQ1: old (4,4)\n\nQ2: old (3,4)\n\nQ3: old (2,4)\n\nQ4: old (1,4)\n\nQ5: old (1,5)\n\nQ6: old (2,5)\n\nQ7: old (3,5)\n\nQ8: old (4,5)  // new tail\n\nOld (5,5) and (5,4) are gone, but (5,4) is new head.\n\nNew tail at (4,5).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,3) or (6,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) is not occupied now.\n\n(5,5) was removed.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 35 from (4,4), I could move D to (4,3) instead.\n\nBut to maximize, moving to (4,4) on turn 35 is good.\n\nThen from there, I can go for (4,6) or (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is above, but (4,5) is body, so I need to go around.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move D to (4,3) on turn 35, then I can go down, but (4,6) is up, so better to go right first.\n\nPerhaps on turn 34, move R to (3,4), then turn 35 move R to (4,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 36 from (4,4), move R to (5,4) which is safe as tail.\n\nThen at (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), R to (6,4), or D to (5,3).\n\n(5,5) is body? After move to (5,4), positions: as above, (5,4) head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail at (4,5)? Indices: Q0 (5,4), Q1 (4,4), Q2 (3,4), Q3 (2,4), Q4 (1,4), Q5 (1,5), Q6 (2,5), Q7 (3,5), Q8 (4,5)\n\nSo (5,5) not occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), move U to (5,5): (5,5) is free, no body.\n\nMove R to (6,4): (6,4) should be free.\n\nMove D to (5,3): (5,3) was tail before, but now free.\n\nAlso, food at (6,5), which is close.\n\n(6,5) at (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (6,4) or (5,5), then to (6,5).\n\nFor example, turn 36: from (5,4) move R to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 37: from (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat food at (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) can be reached later.\n\n(4,6) life span 4, turns 34,35,36,37.\n\nIf I eat (6,5) on turn 37, I can still eat (4,6) if I go there.\n\nBut from (6,5) to (4,6) is |4-6| + |6-5| = 2+1=3 moves, so on turn 38,39,40, but (4,6) gone after turn 37, so not available on turn 38. Turn 37 is last chance.\n\nIf I eat (6,5) on turn 37, I am at (6,5) on turn 37, and (4,6) is at (4,6), which is not adjacent, so I cannot eat it on same turn, and on turn 38 it is gone, so I miss (4,6).\n\nTherefore, I should prioritize eating (4,6) before it expires.\n\n(4,6) life span 4 at turn 34, so must eat by turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) must eat by turn 35.\n\nNow, from current position, if I go for (4,6), how?\n\nFrom head at (2,4), move R to (3,4) on turn 34.\n\nThen from (3,4), at turn 35, I can move U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision, or D to (3,3), or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), I can eat, but then from (4,4) on turn 35, I need to go to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,5) is body, so I cannot go up directly.\n\nFrom (4,4), moves: U to (4,5) collision, D to (4,3), R to (5,4), L invalid.\n\nSo I must move D or R.\n\nIf move R to (5,4), then at (5,4) on turn 36.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), which is free, or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), from (5,4) or (5,5), I need to go to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, or to (5,6) then to (4,6).\n\n(5,6) might be free.\n\nBut (4,6) is available until turn 37.\n\nOn turn 36 at (5,4), move U to (5,5), then on turn 37, from (5,5) move U to (5,6), but (5,6) is not (4,6), I need to go left to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,6) is not adjacent; |4-5| + |6-5| =1+1=2, not adjacent, so I need two moves to reach (4,6) from (5,5): e.g. to (4,5) or (5,6), but (4,5) is body, so I can go to (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 37: from (5,5) move U to (5,6) if possible.\n\nThen turn 38: from (5,6) move L to (4,6) to eat, but turn 38, (4,6) is gone if life span 4, last turn 37.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,6) if I go that way.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 35, instead of moving R to (4,4), I move D to (3,3).\n\nThen at (3,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 36, from (3,3) I can move to (3,4), but (3,4) is body? After turn 35 move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail (5,4) removed? New: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\n(3,4) is body, so from (3,3) move U to (3,4) collision.\n\nMove R to (4,3), or D to (3,2), or L to (2,3).\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) may be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 34, if we moved to (3,4), then to (3,3), (2,3) might be free.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), it's difficult.\n\nFrom current, to reach (4,6) in few moves.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (4,6): |4-2| + |6-4| =2+2=4 moves, but with body, not direct.\n\nShortest path: e.g. (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (4,6), but (4,5) is body, blocked.\n\n(2,4) to (3,4) to (3,5) but (3,5) body, blocked.\n\n(2,4) to (2,5) but (2,5) body, blocked.\n\nSo no direct way; I need to go around.\n\nFor example, (2,4) to (3,4) then to (4,4) then to (5,4) then to (5,5) then to (5,6) then to (4,6), but that's 5 moves, and (5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nFrom turn 34, move to (3,4), turn 35 to (4,4), turn 36 to (5,4), turn 37 to (5,5), but (4,6) must be eaten by turn 37, on turn 37 I am at (5,5), not at (4,6), so cannot eat.\n\nIf I go (2,4) to (3,4) turn 34, then turn 35 to (3,3), turn 36 to (4,3), turn 37 to (4,4), still not (4,6).\n\nNo way to reach (4,6) by turn 37 from here, because of the body blocking the direct path.\n\nTherefore, it might be impossible to eat (4,6) safely, so I should not worry about it and focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) can be eaten if I go down, but with risk of trapping.\n\nBut (4,4) and (6,5) are available longer.\n\n(6,5) life span 10, so I can get it later.\n\nNow, the best move is to go for (4,4) or (6,5).\n\nSince (4,4) is closer, eat that first.\n\nOn turn 34, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 35, move R to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 36, from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) since it's tail, safe.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (5,4), move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4) to go towards (6,5).\n\n(6,5) at (6,5), so from (5,4) move R to (6,4), then U to (6,5).\n\nOr from (5,4) move U to (5,5), then R to (6,5).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,4), the body might have moved, but (4,5) is still body for now.\n\nBut by going to (5,4) and (5,5), it should be fine.\n\nMoreover, (1,3) will expire, but we can't reach it anyway, so let it go.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output 5 actions or so.\n\nBut in the format, it might be open-ended, but for this, I can output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps output until a certain point.\n\nBut to be safe, I can output 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=34.\n\nSo actions for turn 34,35,36,37,38.\n\nBut let's decide the sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 34, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 35, from (3,4), move R to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 36, from (4,4), since direction R, move R to (5,4) (tail, safe).\n\nThen turn 37, from (5,4), move U to (5,5) (assuming free).\n\nThen turn 38, from (5,5), move R to (6,5) to eat if possible, but (6,5) is food, and life span 10, so available.\n\nBut on turn 38, from (5,5) to (6,5) is R, possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAfter these moves, the snake body changes, but (6,5) should be free.\n\nTo avoid the Tail Reward Danger, but (6,5) is not tail, so eating is fine.\n\nBut when we move to (6,5), it's food, so we eat and grow.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 5 turns.\n\nBut on turn 37, I am at (5,4), I could move directly to (6,4) then to (6,5), but similar.\n\nBut moving to (5,5) first might be better to avoid walls or something.\n\nx=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so (6,5) is ok.\n\nNow, for the immediate, on turn 34, move R.\n\nBut I have another option: move D to (2,3) but that seems worse.\n\nPerhaps move R to (3,4) is better.\n\nBut let's see if I can get (1,3) without trapping.\n\nSuppose on turn 34, move D to (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 35, instead of moving to (1,3), move R to (3,3).\n\nThen at (3,3), turn 36, I can move to (4,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nThen I might go to (4,4) later.\n\nBut (1,3) food lost, and I might not get it.\n\nBut (1,3) is only +1, and I can get others.\n\nBy moving R, I can eat (4,4) soon and be in better position.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might affect, but not immediately.\n\nSo I think move R on turn 34 is best.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 36: R (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 37: U (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 38: R (to (6,5))\n\nBut on turn 38, move to (6,5) to eat.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to box the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 35, when I move to (4,4), I eat food, good.\n\nThen on turn 36, move to (5,4), no food, but safe.\n\nThen to (5,5), no food, then to (6,5) eat.\n\nI could from (5,4) on turn 37 move R to (6,4), then turn 38 U to (6,5), same thing.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it's consistent.\n\nTo think ahead, after that, I can go for other areas.\n\nBut for now, this seems good.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 34: R (right) Turn 35: R (right) Turn 36: R (right) Turn 37: U (up) Turn 38: R (right) }\n\nBut in the action, it should be like \"R\" or \"right\", but in the format it says \"action \\in {U, D, L, R}\" so probably use U, D, L, R.\n\nAnd in the box.\n\nAlso, for turn 35, when I move to (4,4), it is eating food, which is good.\n\nAnd I avoided the (1,3) which might trap me.\n\nMoreover, (4,6) I can't reach, so let it expire.\n\n(4,4) I ate on turn 35.\n\n(6,5) I eat on turn 38.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (turns 34 to 38). The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risks**: Moving up (U) from (2,4) to (2,5) is deadly due to body collision. Moving left (L) is invalid as it reverses the current right (R) direction. Thus, only down (D) or right (R) are safe on turn 34.\n- **Food prioritization**: \n  - Food at (1,3) (value +1) expires after turn 35, but going for it risks trapping the snake in the bottom-left corner with limited mobility, reducing access to other food and increasing collision risk. It is not worth the risk for only +1 point.\n  - Food at (4,6) (value +1) expires after turn 37, but the direct path is blocked by the snake's body (e.g., (4,5) is occupied), making it unreachable within the time limit. Thus, it is skipped.\n  - Food at (4,4) (value +1) is close, has a long life span (expires after turn 40), and can be eaten safely on turn 35, providing an immediate +1 and length increase.\n  - Food at (6,5) (value +1) has a long life span (expires after turn 43) and can be targeted later after securing (4,4).\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating (4,4), moving right to (5,4) is safe as it is the tail cell (no collision), and then proceeding to (5,5) and (6,5) avoids body collisions and walls. This path keeps the snake in open areas with access to future food and minimizes trapping risks.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 34-38):**\n- **Turn 34**: Move R (right) to (3,4). This avoids the dangerous down move to (2,3), which could lead to a trap, and positions the snake to reach (4,4) next turn. No food is eaten here.\n- **Turn 35**: Move R (right) to (4,4). This eats the positive food (+1, length increases). From (3,4), moving right is safe and the only efficient way to access the food at (4,4).\n- **Turn 36**: Move R (right) to (5,4). (5,4) is the current tail, so moving here is safe (no collision). This moves the snake toward (6,5) and clears space for future moves. No food is eaten.\n- **Turn 37**: Move U (up) to (5,5). (5,5) is free and not a wall, so this is safe. It positions the snake to reach (6,5) next turn. No food is eaten.\n- **Turn 38**: Move R (right) to (6,5). This eats the positive food at (6,5) (+1, length increases). The move is safe and capitalizes on the long life span of this food.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats two positive foods (at turns 35 and 38) while avoiding all collisions and maintaining flexibility for future turns. After turn 38, the snake can continue exploring for other food (e.g., remaining or new spawns) with a clear path.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 34: R \\newline Turn 35: R \\newline Turn 36: R \\newline Turn 37: U \\newline Turn 38: R }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let me see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). That's 9 segments.\n\nHead direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life_span 3\n\n- (4,4) with value 1, life_span 6\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life_span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned. But life_span: for (1,3), life_span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? Life-span disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nCurrent turn is t=35. So for food at (1,3), life_span=1, so after this turn (turn 35), it will disappear. Because countdown decreases on current turn, so if life_span=1, it should be available only on turn 35, and disappear before turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 37 (since countdown on turn 35,36,37, gone after 37).\n\nTurn t: food with life_span N, countdown starts at N on turn t, decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0, meaning after N turns from now.\n\n- On turn t, life_span N, available.\n\n- Turn t+1, life_span N-1, if N-1>0, still available.\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + (N-1), life_span 1, available.\n\n- Turn t + N, life_span 0, disappears, not available.\n\nFor (1,3): life_span=1 at turn 35, so available only on turn 35, disappears after turn 35 (before turn 36).\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life_span=3, available on turns 35,36,37, disappears after turn 37.\n\n(4,4): life_span=6, available turns 35 to 40.\n\n(6,5): life_span=9, available turns 35 to 43.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,4), direction R (right).\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left. Allowed: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is obstacle.\n\nSnake body: positions from head to tail: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nI need to list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nBody: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nTail is (5,4)\n\nFood locations: (1,3), (4,6), (4,4), (6,5)\n\n(4,4) has food, but snake head is at (3,4), and (4,4) is a body segment? Let's see snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\n(4,4) is not in the list? Positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). So (4,4) is not occupied by snake? But there is food at (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is food, (4,6) food, (6,5) food.\n\nNow, (4,4) is empty? Snake has segments at (3,4), (2,4), etc., but not (4,4). Let's list all snake positions:\n\n- (3,4) head\n\n- (2,4) body\n\n- (1,4) body\n\n- (1,5) body\n\n- (2,5) body\n\n- (3,5) body\n\n- (4,5) body\n\n- (5,5) body\n\n- (5,4) tail\n\nSo cells occupied: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nTherefore, (4,4) is free and has food. Similarly, (1,3) is free, (4,6) is free? (4,6) y=6, is it within bounds? y from 1 to 6, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is valid. But internal obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) should be free unless occupied.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is different cell.\n\n(6,5) is also free.\n\nFood at (4,6), but (4,6) might be accessible? y=6 is not wall, and no obstacle mentioned except (3,6), so (4,6) should be ok.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) x=1,y=3.\n\nNow, for turn 35, I need to choose action: U, D, or R (since cannot L).\n\nCurrent head: (3,4)\n\nMove options:\n\n- Up (U): to (3,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,4)\n\nNow, check each for collision:\n\nFirst, U to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,5) is the 6th segment? List: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4) tail.\n\nSo (3,5) is position of segment 5, which is body. If I move to (3,5), head would be at same position as segment 5, which is not the tail, so collision, death.\n\nCannot move up to (3,5).\n\nDown to (3,3): (3,3) is within bounds? x=3,y=3, between 1 and 6, and not wall, no obstacle mentioned, so should be free. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), etc., no (3,3), so free. And no food mentioned there, so empty cell.\n\nRight to (4,4): (4,4) has food, and is it occupied? Snake positions no (4,4), so free except for food.\n\nBut (4,4) has food, so moving there would eat it.\n\nNow, also need to consider tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves.\n\nAvailable moves: D to (3,3) or R to (4,4)\n\nU to (3,5) is occupied, so invalid.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, R to (4,4): (4,4) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, after moving, the new head is at (4,4), and the tail was at (5,4), which will move? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away, so tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nIf I eat food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nBut tail reward danger: here, is head adjacent to tail? Current head at (3,4), tail at (5,4). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (5,4) are two cells apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means next to each other, like same row or column, distance 1.\n\n(3,4) to (5,4) is |dx|=2, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), new head at (4,4), tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent, since |dx|=1, |dy|=0, so adjacent horizontally.\n\n(4,4) and (5,4) are adjacent.\n\nBut tail reward danger only when eating food that is under the tail, I think.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n\nHere, the food is at (4,4), which is not the tail cell. Tail cell is (5,4), which has no food mentioned. Food is at (4,4), which is a new cell.\n\nSo when I move to (4,4), I eat the food there, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), and the segment that was at (5,4) remains, but since I ate food, a new segment is added, so tail stays where it was? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment in front, tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,4) and eat food, new head at (4,4), and a new tail segment is added at the current tail position (5,4), so the tail is now at (5,4), but since we add a segment, the previous tail stays, and the new segment is added there.\n\nThe body segments: after move, head is at new position, and the body includes all previous positions except that if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so positions are: new head, then the old head becomes second, and so on, up to the tail which remains if food eaten.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P8 where P0 head (3,4), P8 tail (5,4)\n\n- Move to new position N.\n\nIf no food, new positions: N, P0, P1, ..., P7 (P8 vacated)\n\nIf food eaten, new positions: N, P0, P1, ..., P8 (so length increases, tail at P8)\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,4) which has food, so eat food, new positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nSo tail is still at (5,4), and head at (4,4), which are adjacent.\n\nNow, is there food under the tail? Tail cell is (5,4), which has no food, so no tail reward danger.\n\nThe rule is about eating food that is under the tail, but here we are eating food at (4,4), not related to tail.\n\nTail reward danger is when the tail cell itself has food, and head is adjacent, then eating that food causes collision.\n\nBut here, tail cell (5,4) has no food, so no issue.\n\nSo moving to (4,4) seems safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAnother option is to move down to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is empty, no food, so no growth.\n\nAfter move down: head to (3,3), no food, so new positions: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and tail was (5,4), but since no food, tail moves, so P8 (5,4) vacated, new tail is (5,5)? Positions: new head (3,3), then old head (3,4) now second, then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and since no food, the last segment (5,4) is removed, so tail is now (5,5).\n\nList:\n\nBefore: [ (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nAfter move down to (3,3), no food eaten:\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)  -- and (5,4) vacated, so tail is (5,5).\n\nLength decreases? No, length remains 9, since no growth, but positions shifted.\n\nOriginal 9 segments, after move, still 9 segments: from (3,3) to (5,5).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nAt turn 35, I can:\n\n- Move R to (4,4): eat food, grow to length 10, head at (4,4), tail at (5,4)\n\n- Move D to (3,3): no food, head at (3,3), tail at (5,5)\n\nMove U is invalid, move L invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving right to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nAfter that, head at (4,4), direction? Since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n\nNow, from there, possible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, since current direction R)\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied by snake body? Current positions after move: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\n(4,5) is segment 7, occupied, so cannot move up to (4,5).\n\nD to (4,3): should be free, no issue.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is tail, but after we ate food, tail is at (5,4), and head at (4,4), adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), but (5,4) is currently the tail cell.\n\nNow, moving to (5,4): since it's the tail, in snake, moving to the tail cell is usually safe because the tail will move away, but only if no food eaten.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut that assumes no food is eaten, so tail moves.\n\nIf food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so if I move to tail cell when food is eaten, it would be collision.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,4) now, but (5,4) has no food, so if I move there, since it's tail, and no food, the tail would move away, so it should be safe.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nNow, if I move right to (5,4), which is tail.\n\nSince I move to (5,4), and it's the tail, and no food at (5,4), so when I move, head goes to (5,4), and since no food eaten, the tail (5,4) moves away, but the tail was at (5,4), and head moves there, but since tail moves, it's ok, as long as no other body part.\n\nSpecifically: when head moves to the tail position, and no food, the tail moves to the previous position, so the cell is vacated just before head enters, so no collision.\n\nStandard behavior.\n\nMoreover, (5,4) has no food, so no growth.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,4), then previous head (4,4) becomes second, and so on, up to the segment before tail. Tail was (5,4), but since head moved there, and no food, the segment that was tail is removed, and the new tail is the last body segment.\n\nBefore move: positions: H: (4,4), B1: (3,4), B2: (2,4), B3: (1,4), B4: (1,5), B5: (2,5), B6: (3,5), B7: (4,5), B8: (5,5), T: (5,4)\n\nMove to (5,4):\n\n- Head moves to (5,4)\n\n- Since no food, tail is removed, so new positions: (5,4) head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) becomes the new tail? Let's see:\n\nThe body segments shift: new head at (5,4), then the previous head (4,4) is next, then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and the previous B8 (5,5) is now the last, so tail at (5,5).\n\nAnd (5,4) was tail but now head, and (5,5) is new tail.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (5,4) is possible from (4,4).\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), I eat food, grow to 10.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4) or U is blocked.\n\nU to (4,5) is occupied, so only D or R.\n\nNow, moving D to (4,3) is empty.\n\nOr R to (5,4) which is now tail, but safe as above.\n\nBut let's think about other food.\n\nFood at (1,3) with life_span 1, so only available this turn, turn 35. If I don't eat it now, it disappears.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), snake head at (3,4), to reach (1,3) I need to go left, but I cannot move left directly, and it might be far.\n\nFrom (3,4), to go to (1,3), I need to move down to (3,3) or left, but cannot left, so down to (3,3), then to (2,3) or (3,2), etc., but (1,3) is two moves away, and since life_span 1, after this turn it disappears, so I cannot eat it unless I am adjacent now or something.\n\nHead at (3,4), (1,3) is not adjacent; adjacent would be (2,4), (3,3), (4,4), (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, (4,4) has food but different, (2,4) is body, (3,3) empty.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can move to (3,3), which is adjacent to (2,3) and (3,2), but not directly to (1,3). To reach (1,3) from (3,3), I need to go to (2,3) then (1,3), but that would be turn 36, but food disappears after turn 35, so on turn 36 it's gone. So impossible to eat (1,3) now. It must be eaten this turn or not at all.\n\nBut to eat it this turn, I need to be at (1,3) or move to it, but from (3,4), I cannot move to (1,3) directly; I need to be adjacent.\n\nThe only way to eat it is if head moves to (1,3) this turn.\n\nBut from current position (3,4), possible moves are to (3,5) occupied, (3,3), or (4,4). None is (1,3), so I cannot reach (1,3) this turn. Therefore, I cannot eat (1,3) at all; it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo forget about (1,3).\n\nNow, other food: (4,6) life_span 3, so available turns 35,36,37.\n\n(4,4) life_span 6, available now.\n\n(6,5) life_span 9, available long time.\n\nNow, back to turn 35 action.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (4,4) to eat that food.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nFrom there, I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), as before, no food, so positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nNow, from (5,4), direction R, I can move U, D, R (cannot L).\n\nU to (5,5): (5,5) is tail, but after move, it might be body.\n\nCurrent positions before move from (5,4): head (5,4), body: (4,4), (3,4), etc., (5,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move to (5,5), which is tail, no food there, so should be safe: head to (5,5), tail moves away to (4,5) or something.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail? Let's see:\n\nAfter moving to (5,5):\n\n- Head to (5,5)\n\n- No food, so tail removed, new positions: (5,5) head, (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) becomes tail? Previous positions: H(5,4), B1(4,4), B2(3,4), B3(2,4), B4(1,4), B5(1,5), B6(2,5), B7(3,5), B8(4,5), T(5,5) — I think I have inconsistency.\n\nEarlier after moving to (5,4) from (4,4), positions were: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and tail (5,5)? No.\n\nFrom turn 35 move R to (4,4): positions: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail\n\nThen move R to (5,4): head to (5,4), no food, so new positions: (5,4) head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) and the previous tail (5,4) is now head, so the segment that was at (5,5) is now the last, so tail at (5,5).\n\nPositions: new head (5,4), then the old segments: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) is still there, so (5,5) is the new tail.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (5,4), move to (5,5): (5,5) is tail, move there, no food, so head to (5,5), and since no food, tail is removed, which is (5,5), but head is moving there, so it's ok, the cell is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move, but let's not go too deep.\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nOption 2: move down to (3,3).\n\nThen head at (3,3), no food, positions: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection: moved down, so new direction D.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2) (cannot U, since direction D, opposite U not allowed).\n\nCurrent direction after move is D, so cannot move U (up), allowed L, R, D.\n\nL to (2,3): should be free.\n\nR to (4,3): free.\n\nD to (3,2): free, assuming within bounds.\n\ny=2, x=3, should be ok.\n\nNow, food at (4,6) life_span 3, available for 3 turns.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to approach from left, right, or below, but (4,5) is occupied by snake? Current positions after move down: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(4,5) is occupied, (4,6) is above it, but (4,5) is body, so I can move to (4,6) only if I am at (4,5) and move up, but (4,5) is not head.\n\nHead is at (3,3), far.\n\nAlso, (4,6) has life_span 3, so I have turns 35,36,37 to eat it.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move head to (4,6).\n\nFrom current, it might take a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,4) which I could eat now by moving right.\n\nBut if I move down, I miss eating (4,4) now, but it has life_span 6, so I can eat later.\n\n(4,4) life_span 6, available until turn 40.\n\n(6,5) life_span 9, until turn 43.\n\nNow, long-term survival: the snake is quite long, 9 segments, in a 6x6 grid with obstacles, so space might be tight.\n\nGrid size: x 1-6, y 1-6, 36 cells, minus obstacle at (3,6), so 35 cells, snake length 9, so 26 free cells? But with food, etc.\n\nBut snake can occupy cells.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to eat food, but avoid dying.\n\nAlso, with internal obstacle, it might create dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (4,6) might be tricky because of the obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is wall, so cells around: (3,6) blocked, so (4,6) can be accessed from (4,5), (5,6), (4,7) but y=7 wall, so only from (4,5) or (5,6) or (3,6) blocked.\n\n(5,6) is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) etc.\n\nBut snake has body at (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nLet's think about moving to (4,4) now.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) at turn 35, eat food, grow to 10.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2), or (3,3), or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) food is available for 3 turns, so I might want to go towards it.\n\nFrom (4,3), I could go up to (4,4) but (4,4) is now body, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) and then D to (4,3), positions: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail? After eating at (4,4), positions are: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nThen move D to (4,3): no food, so new positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) and tail (5,4) removed? No: since no food, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: (4,3) head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5).\n\n(5,4) vacated.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2) (cannot U, direction D).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, so I need to go north.\n\nBut from (4,3), moving up is not allowed because direction is D, so I can only move L, R, D, not U.\n\nSo I am forced to move down or left/right, not up.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to change direction.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I could move R to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can move U to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) might be free now.\n\nAfter positions, (5,5) is tail, (5,4) is free.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can move to (5,4), then to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, etc.\n\nIt might take time to reach (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), and (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so to eat (4,6), I need to move to (4,6) from adjacent, but (4,5) is occupied, so I need to have head at (4,5) and move up, or at (3,6) but (3,6) wall, or at (5,6), or at (4,7) wall.\n\nSo only possible from (4,5) or (5,6) or (3,6) blocked, so from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied, so I need to vacate it first.\n\nThat is, the snake must move away from (4,5), so that (4,5) is free, then later head can move to (4,5) and then to (4,6).\n\nBut when head moves to (4,5), if it is free, and then to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) has food, so eating at (4,6).\n\nBut life_span 3, so I have time.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,4) now, and move down to (3,3), then head at (3,3), I can then move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) food is still there, life_span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3), then U to (4,4) to eat it, but at turn 36 or later.\n\nBut at turn 35, if I move down to (3,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 36, from (3,3), direction D, I can move L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2).\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat the food, since (4,4) has food.\n\nAt turn 36, (4,4) still available, life_span 6, countdown to 5 at turn 36.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut in this case, I eat at turn 36 instead of turn 35, but same score.\n\nBut by eating at turn 35, I grow earlier, which might allow me to eat other food, but also makes snake longer, harder to maneuver.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating sooner or later doesn't matter for score, as long as I eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut for survival, longer snake might be riskier in small grid.\n\nGrid has 35 cells, snake length 9, after eating one, 10, so 25 free cells.\n\nWith internal obstacle, it might have dead ends.\n\nFor example, the top row: y=6, with (3,6) obstacle, so cells (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) are accessible, but (4,6) has food.\n\nSnake has segments at (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), so the row below is occupied.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go to (4,5) first, but (4,5) is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move the snake to free up (4,5).\n\nFor instance, if I move the tail away.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,4) if I didn't eat, or after eating at (4,4), tail at (5,4) or (5,5) etc.\n\nLet's prioritize the food with short life.\n\n(4,6) has only 3 turns left, so I should try to eat it soon.\n\n(1,3) is impossible, so ignore.\n\n(4,4) has 6 turns, plenty.\n\n(6,5) has 9 turns.\n\nSo focus on (4,6).\n\nTo eat (4,6), I need to have head at (4,5) and move up, or at (5,6) and move left.\n\n(5,6) is free, I think.\n\nCells: (5,6) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is occupied by snake body.\n\nSo easier to go via (5,6).\n\nThat is, move to (5,6) then left to (4,6).\n\nBut from current position.\n\nAt turn 35, head at (3,4).\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), then to (4,3) or (3,2), etc., not directly towards (4,6).\n\nIf I move right to (4,4), then I am closer to the right side.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) is occupied, so from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, or D to (5,3), or R to (6,4).\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nFree cells: all cells not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (3,6)\n\nSnake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nSo occupied: those 9 cells.\n\nGrid cells: x1-6, y1-6 except (3,6) obstacle.\n\nSo free cells: for y=1: all (1,1) to (6,1)\n\ny=2: (1,2) to (6,2)\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)  (1,3) has food but disappearing, so after this turn, gone.\n\ny=4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (3,4) occupied, (4,4) food, (5,4) occupied, (6,4) free\n\ny=5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5) occupied, (3,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (6,5) food\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (4,6) food, (5,6), (6,6)  (3,6) obstacle, so (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) free except (4,6) has food.\n\n(4,6) has food, so cell is occupied by food, but for movement, I can move there to eat.\n\nBut currently, (4,5) is occupied by snake, so I cannot move to (4,6) directly from elsewhere; I need to be at (4,5) or (5,6) or (3,6) blocked.\n\nSo only adjacent cells are (4,5) and (5,6), since (4,7) out of bound, (3,6) wall.\n\n(5,6) is free, so I can move to (5,6) from (5,5) or (6,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is occupied.\n\nSo to reach (5,6), I need to have head at (5,5) and move up, or at (6,6) and move left, or at (5,7) wall, etc.\n\nSo similarly, from (5,5) move U to (5,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is body, not head.\n\nHead is at (3,4).\n\nSo I need to move the head to (5,5) first, which is occupied, so must vacate.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps I should move in a way to free up space.\n\nFor turn 35, if I move down to (3,3), then the tail is at (5,5), and I can move towards the bottom or left.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (4,3), then to (4,4) to eat food later.\n\nBut for (4,6), with life_span 3, I have only 3 turns to eat it.\n\nTurn 35,36,37 available.\n\nAt turn 35, head at (3,4), I move to (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,4), then at (4,4), I can move to (5,4), then at turn 36, head at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, or to (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,5), from (5,4) to (5,5), which is tail, safe, then head at (5,5), then I can move U to (5,6) at turn 37.\n\nThen from (5,6), move L to (4,6) to eat at turn 38, but turn 38 is after turn 37, so life_span: at turn 35, life_span 3, so available on 35,36,37, disappears after turn 37, so on turn 38 it's gone, so I cannot eat on turn 38.\n\nLet's clarify the life_span.\n\nFood at (4,6) with life_span 3 at turn 35.\n\n- Turn 35: available, life_span 3\n\n- Turn 36: available, life_span 2\n\n- Turn 37: available, life_span 1\n\n- Turn 38: disappeared, life_span 0\n\nSo to eat, I must move head to (4,6) on or before turn 37.\n\nSo latest turn 37.\n\nIn the scenario above, if I move to (5,6) on turn 37, I can then move to (4,6) on turn 38, but on turn 38 it's gone, so too late.\n\nI need to be at (4,6) by turn 37.\n\nSo I must reach (4,6) on turn 35, 36, or 37.\n\nOn turn 35, head at (3,4), not adjacent to (4,6), so cannot reach on 35.\n\nOn turn 36, head must be at (4,6) or adjacent to move to it.\n\nSimilarly for turn 37.\n\nSo to eat on turn 36, head must be at (4,5) or (5,6) on turn 36, then move to (4,6) on turn 36.\n\nTo eat on turn 37, head must be at (4,5) or (5,6) on turn 37, move to (4,6) on turn 37.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so it needs to be free when head moves there.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nSo let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, at turn 35, if I move down to (3,3), then head at (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 36, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) or (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nSay I move R to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat food there, but (4,4) is food, but I want to go to (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), but that's eating (4,4), not going to (4,6).\n\nTo go to (4,6), from (4,3), I need to go up, but (4,4) is in the way with food, but I can eat it or not.\n\nFrom (4,3), move U to (4,4) to eat (4,4), then on turn 37, head at (4,4), then I can move U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nSo I cannot move to (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), instead of moving U, I could move R to (5,3), then U to (5,4), etc., but far from (4,6).\n\nTo reach (5,6) or (4,5) free.\n\nBut (4,5) is currently occupied, and will be free only if the snake moves away.\n\nFor example, if the tail moves.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,4) if I didn't eat, or at (5,5) after some moves.\n\nAssume at turn 35 I move down to (3,3), no growth.\n\nPositions turn 35: head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nOn turn 36, from (3,3), I move R to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nPositions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (5,5)? New positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) tail.\n\n(5,5) is still tail, but not moved yet.\n\nOn turn 37, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat food, then head at (4,4), positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) tail? Since ate food, new segment at tail, so positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) is still occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), the snake needs to move so that (4,5) is vacated.\n\nFor example, if I move the head away, the tail will move when no growth.\n\nBut tail is at (5,5), which is not moving yet.\n\nOn turn 37, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), I can move only L, R, D (direction U? I moved U to (4,4), so direction now U.\n\nFrom (4,3) moved U to (4,4), so new direction U.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) but occupied, or L to (3,4) occupied, or R to (5,4) free, or D to (4,3) occupied.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5) occupied, invalid; L to (3,4) occupied, invalid; R to (5,4) free; D to (4,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only R to (5,4).\n\nThen move to (5,4), no food, so positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail at (4,5)? New positions: (5,4) head, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) tail.\n\n(4,5) is now tail.\n\nOn turn 38, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3) or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is already gone after turn 37, so I missed it.\n\nIf I didn't eat at (4,4) on turn 37, from (4,3) on turn 37, instead of moving U to (4,4), I move R to (5,3), for example.\n\nThen head at (5,3), then on turn 38, I can move to (5,4), etc., but (4,6) gone.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (4,6) in time if I move down at turn 35.\n\nNow, if at turn 35 I move right to (4,4), eat food.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction R.\n\nOn turn 36, from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nSay I move R to (5,4), then head at (5,4), no food, positions: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nOn turn 37, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) but (5,5) is tail, move there, no food, so safe: head to (5,5), tail moves, new positions: (5,5) head, (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail at (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 37, head at (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), which is free, so move to (5,6), no food there, positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), etc., tail at (4,5) or something.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) tail? Since no food, tail removed, so new tail is (3,5) or let's see: previous positions before move: H(5,5), B1(5,4), B2(4,4), B3(3,4), B4(2,4), B5(1,4), B6(1,5), B7(2,5), B8(3,5), T(4,5)\n\nMove to (5,6): head to (5,6), no food, so new positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) and (4,5) vacated, tail at (3,5).\n\nOn turn 37, I am at (5,6), and (4,6) is adjacent, so I can move L to (4,6) to eat the food on turn 37, which is the last chance.\n\nYes! So on turn 37, move L to (4,6), eat food.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo by moving right at turn 35 to (4,4), then right to (5,4) at turn 36, then up to (5,6) at turn 37? Turn 37: from (5,4) move U to (5,5) first, then to (5,6).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 35: move R to (4,4), eat (4,4), head at (4,4)\n\nTurn 36: move R to (5,4), no food, head at (5,4)\n\nTurn 37: move U to (5,5), no food, head at (5,5)  -- but (5,5) was tail, but safe\n\nThen on turn 37, head at (5,5), but to move to (5,6), I need another turn.\n\nTurn 37: after moving to (5,5), it's turn 37, but (4,6) must be eaten on turn 37.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5) on turn 37, I am at (5,5), and (4,6) is not adjacent; (4,6) is at dx=1, dy=1, not adjacent; adjacent are (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is occupied, (5,4) is body, (6,5) has food but different, (5,6) is free.\n\nSo from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) on turn 37.\n\nThen at (5,6), I am adjacent to (4,6), but on turn 37, I am at (5,6), not at (4,6). To eat (4,6), I need to move to it on turn 37.\n\nBut on turn 37, I moved to (5,6), so I am not at (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 38, I could move to (4,6), but on turn 38, (4,6) is gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nOn turn 37, if I am at (5,5), I can move directly to (4,6)? But (4,6) is not adjacent to (5,5); adjacent are (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to (4,6) from (5,5).\n\nThe only way to reach (4,6) is from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nSo on turn 37, if I am at (5,6), I can move to (4,6).\n\nBut to be at (5,6) on turn 37, I need to have moved there on turn 37.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 37, from (5,4) I can move directly to (5,6)? But (5,6) is not adjacent to (5,4); from (5,4) to (5,6) is two steps, not possible in one move.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can only move to (5,5), (5,3), or (6,4).\n\nSo I have to go to (5,5) first on turn 37, then to (5,6) on turn 38, but turn 38 too late for (4,6).\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (4,6) if I eat (4,4) on turn 35.\n\nBecause after eating (4,4), the body blocks the way to (4,5), and I can't reach (5,6) in time.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,4) on turn 35, and move down to (3,3), then on turn 36 I can move to (4,3), then on turn 37 to (4,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), I need to be at (4,5) or (5,6) on turn 37 to move to (4,6) on turn 37.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied until the snake moves away.\n\nFor example, at turn 35, move D to (3,3), positions: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nOn turn 36, move R to (4,3), positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) is still occupied.\n\nOn turn 37, from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) to eat food, or to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to (4,5) or (5,6) from here.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) on turn 37, then I am at (4,4), but (4,5) occupied, cannot go up.\n\nSo still cannot reach (4,6) on turn 37.\n\nThe only way to free (4,5) is to have the tail move away.\n\nBut tail is at (5,5), and it moves only when no growth and head moves.\n\nFor example, if on turn 36, from (3,3) I move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2), but that moves away from (4,6).\n\nSuppose on turn 35 move D to (3,3).\n\nTurn 36 move L to (2,3), then positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nTurn 37 move U to (2,4) but occupied, or to (2,2), or to (1,3) but gone, or to (3,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (2,3), moves: U to (2,4) occupied, D to (2,2), L to (1,3) gone or free but no food, R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo only D to (2,2) or L to (1,3) but (1,3) food gone, so move D to (2,2).\n\nThen no progress to (4,6).\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (4,6) within the turns, because the body is blocking the access, and I don't have time to free it.\n\nTherefore, I should give up on (4,6) and focus on other food.\n\n(4,6) has only value 1, and I might risk dying if I try to go there.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nBetter to eat the available food at (4,4) now and then plan for the future.\n\nAlso, (6,5) has food with long life, so I can go there later.\n\nAt turn 35, move R to (4,4) to eat food, grow to 10.\n\nThen from there, I can move to the bottom or right.\n\nFor example, move D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nOr R to (5,4) to go right.\n\nSince (6,5) has food, I can head towards it.\n\nMove R to (5,4) on turn 36, then to (6,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), which is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), move R to (6,4), then U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nOr directly if possible.\n\nBut let's not plan all turns yet.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for a few turns, but the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for the current and future turns, but it doesn't specify how many turns to list.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't say how many. Probably for as many as I can or for the immediate decisions.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but for output, perhaps list the next few actions based on the plan.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 35, I think moving right to eat (4,4) is good, then move right to (5,4), then up to (5,5), etc., but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother option: at turn 35, move down to (3,3), avoid growing now, to keep snake shorter, but I miss the food, but can eat later.\n\nBut since all food is +1, eating later is fine, but the food at (4,4) might be eaten later, but with shorter snake, easier to move.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,3), no growth, snake length 9.\n\nThen on turn 36, from (3,3) move R to (4,3), then on turn 37 move U to (4,4) to eat (4,4), same as before but one turn later.\n\nThen I can go to (6,5) later.\n\nAnd (4,6) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life_span 9, so I have time.\n\nSo both options are possible, but moving right now allows me to eat sooner, which might be better if there are risks, but here no immediate risk.\n\nBut let's check for immediate danger.\n\nCurrent position, if I move down to (3,3), it's free, no issue.\n\nIf I move right to (4,4), eat food, no issue.\n\nThen from (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is free, moving right to (5,4) is free.\n\n(5,4) was tail, but safe.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), the tail is at (5,5), so (5,4) is head, etc.\n\nI think moving right to eat now is fine.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, let's sketch a plan.\n\nTurn 35: move R to (4,4)  // eat food, grow to 10\n\nTurn 36: from (4,4) move R to (5,4)  // no food, head to (5,4), tail to (5,5)? Positions: after turn 35, head at (4,4), body (3,4) to (5,4) tail? After turn 35: positions (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail\n\nMove R to (5,4): (5,4) is tail, move there, no food, so head to (5,4), new positions: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail\n\nTurn 37: from (5,4) move U to (5,5)  // (5,5) is tail, move there, no food, safe. Head to (5,5), new positions: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail\n\nTurn 38: from (5,5) move U to (5,6)  // (5,6) free, no food, head to (5,6), new positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) and (4,5) vacated, tail at (3,5)\n\nTurn 39: from (5,6) move L to (4,6) but (4,6) food is gone, but there is no food there now, or if there was, but it disappeared.\n\n(4,6) gone, so move to (4,6) only if food, but no, so perhaps move L to (4,6) to go to that area, but (4,6) is free now, no food.\n\nThen head at (4,6), etc.\n\nBut I can go to (6,5) later.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), then down or something.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), which has food.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move D to (4,5), but (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn the positions above, on turn 38, tail at (3,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nTo eat (6,5), I can go from (5,6) move R to (6,6), then D to (6,5) to eat.\n\nOr directly if possible.\n\nBut (6,5) is adjacent to (5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (5,5) might be occupied.\n\nBut in the future, it might be free.\n\nSince I need to output for turn 35 and perhaps a few more, but the format is to list actions starting from turn 35.\n\nI think for turn 35, moving right to eat the food is a good choice.\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3) to go to the bottom area where there is space.\n\nMove R to (5,4) to go right.\n\nMoving down might be better to avoid the top with obstacle.\n\nFor example, move D to (4,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nThen later to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) food has life_span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, at turn 35, move right to (4,4).\n\nThen for the answer, I need to list multiple turns, but since the state changes, I can list for turn 35 only, or for a few turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"answer format\" with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc., so probably for the immediate next turns based on the plan.\n\nBut to be precise, I can list for turn 35 and then for 36, 37 based on the plan.\n\nBut it might not be optimal, but for now.\n\nI think for turn 35, move R.\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), move D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nThen turn 37 from (4,3) move R to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify.\n\nPerhaps in the answer, list only turn 35 action, but the format suggests multiple.\n\nLook: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince I think 5+ turns ahead, I can provide 5 turns.\n\nBut the state might have food appearing, but here no new food, only existing.\n\nFood positions are given, no new spawn mentioned.\n\nSo only these foods.\n\nSo for turn 35 to 39, for example.\n\nPlan:\n\nTurn 35: move R to (4,4)  // eat food\n\nTurn 36: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)  // go down, no food\n\nTurn 37: from (4,3), direction D, can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2)\n\nSay move R to (5,3)  // no food\n\nTurn 38: from (5,3), direction R, can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\nMove R to (6,3)  // no food\n\nTurn 39: from (6,3), direction R, can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid, so U or D or L but L opposite, cannot, so U or D.\n\nMove U to (6,4)  // no food\n\nThen later to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), from (6,4) move U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut not in 5 turns.\n\nSince (6,5) is close, from turn 38 at (6,3), move U to (6,4) on turn 39, then U to (6,5) on turn 40 to eat.\n\nBut life_span 9, available until turn 43, so fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 37 I moved to (5,3), but I could go directly.\n\nFrom turn 36 at (4,3), instead of moving to (5,3), move to (4,2) or (3,3), but to reach (6,5), moving right is better.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the first few actions.\n\nSo for turn 35: R\n\nTurn 36: D (down)\n\nThen from there, but I need to specify.\n\nSince the direction changes, I need to think.\n\nPerhaps for turn 35, move R.\n\nThen for turn 36, from (4,4), move R to (5,4) to go right.\n\nThen turn 37 from (5,4) move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 38 from (5,5) move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 39 from (5,6) move L to (4,6) but no food, or to (6,6) etc.\n\nBut (4,6) food gone, so no point.\n\nSo better to go down.\n\nI think moving down on turn 36 is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 35 and Beyond\n\n**Current State Summary (Turn 35):**\n- **Grid**: 7x7 playable area (cells from (1,1) to (6,6)), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (3,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (3,4), body segments at (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), tail at (5,4). Length = 9.\n  - Head direction: Right (R), so cannot move left (instant reverse forbidden).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life_span 1 (disappears after Turn 35; cannot be eaten as not reachable this turn).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life_span 3 (available Turns 35-37; but inaccessible due to body blocking and short time).\n  - (4,4): Value +1, life_span 6 (available Turns 35-40; easily accessible and safe to eat now).\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life_span 9 (available Turns 35-43; long-term target).\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 35)**:\n  - Up (U) to (3,5): Occupied by body segment (3,5), collision, invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (3,3): Empty, no food, safe but misses opportunity to eat (4,4).\n  - Right (R) to (4,4): Food present, eating it grows snake to length 10, safe (no tail reward danger as tail is at (5,4) with no food).\n\n**Key Decisions and 5+ Turn Lookahead:**\n- **Prioritize Eating (4,4) Now**: \n  - Eating (4,4) on Turn 35 scores +1, grows snake to 10, and positions the snake better for accessing (6,5) later. Avoiding it to keep the snake shorter is unnecessary as (4,4) has high life_span (6 turns), but eating now simplifies the path to (6,5).\n  - (4,6) is abandoned: It requires reaching (4,5) or (5,6) by Turn 37 to eat on Turn 37, but (4,5) is body-occupied and cannot be freed in time. Attempting it risks dead ends or collisions, so it is not worth the risk for +1.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**:\n  - After eating (4,4), move downward (D) on Turn 36 to (4,3) to avoid the congested top area (near obstacle (3,6)) and head toward the bottom-right where (6,5) is located. This opens space and reduces collision risk.\n  - (6,5) is the primary long-term target (life_span 9, ample time). Path: From (4,3), move right to (5,3) and then to (6,3), setting up a turn to (6,4) and (6,5) for eating.\n  - Snake growth to 10 is manageable; grid has 35 free cells (36 total -1 obstacle), leaving 25 free after growth. Movement plan avoids dead ends and walls.\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - No negative food present.\n  - Tail reward danger checked: Not applicable when eating (4,4) as tail (5,4) has no food and is not adjacent during the eat.\n  - Wall and body collisions avoided in the plan by choosing safe moves.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 35-39):**\n- **Turn 35 (Current Turn)**: Move R (right) to (4,4) to eat positive food (+1, growth to length 10). New head position: (4,4), direction R.\n- **Turn 36**: Move D (down) to (4,3). No food, direction changes to D. This moves away from the top obstacle and toward open space.\n- **Turn 37**: Move R (right) to (5,3). No food, direction changes to R. Positions snake for rightward movement to (6,5).\n- **Turn 38**: Move R (right) to (6,3). No food, direction R. Now adjacent to (6,4), setting up the approach to (6,5).\n- **Turn 39**: Move U (up) to (6,4). No food, direction U. Prepares to eat (6,5) on Turn 40 or later (within life_span).\n\n**Beyond Turn 39**:\n- Turn 40: Move U to (6,5) to eat (6,5) if still present (life_span allows).\n- Continue exploring bottom and right areas for potential new food or survival, avoiding the top obstacle.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating (4,4) immediately and sets up a safe path to (6,5) while avoiding risks. It prioritizes long-term survival by moving to less congested areas and thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: R (right)  \nTurn 36: D (down)  \nTurn 37: R (right)  \nTurn 38: R (right)  \nTurn 39: U (up)  \n}",

        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 37, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Next: (4,4)\n\n- Then: (3,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- Tail: (5,5)\n\nSo the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means it's moving downward. Since it's moving down, the last move was from (4,2) or something? Let's see the positions: head at (4,3), and previous position is (4,4), but (4,4) has a higher y-value? I need to think about coordinates.\n\nTypically, in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is down, and head is at (4,3), and the next segment is (4,4), which has a higher y, so if y increases upward, then (4,4) is above (4,3), but head direction is down, meaning decreasing y? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So:\n\n- Up: y increases\n\n- Down: y decreases\n\n- Left: x decreases\n\n- Right: x increases\n\nSo, head at (4,3) with direction down, meaning it came from (4,4) since (4,4) to (4,3) is down (y from 4 to 3, decrease).\n\nSnake positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), ...] so from head to tail: (4,3) is head, then (4,4) is the next segment, but if head is moving down to (4,3), the previous head position was (4,4), which is now the first body segment.\n\nThe list is head first, so at this turn, head is at (4,3), and it was at (4,4) last turn. Since direction is down, moving to (4,3) decreased y.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,6,2,1): position (4,6), life span 2, value +1\n\n- (6,5,7,1): position (6,5), life span 7, value +1\n\n- (1,6,10,1): position (1,6), life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (4,6), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including this one, so after turn 37 and 38, it will be gone by turn 39? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (4,6) with life span 2: on turn 37, it has life span 2, so after this turn, it decreases to 1, and after turn 38, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 7: from turn 37, it will last until turn 43? Life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor (4,6): life span 2 at turn 37, so exists on turn 37 and 38, gone on turn 39.\n\n(6,5): life span 7, exists from turn 37 to 43, gone on 44.\n\n(1,6): life span 10, exists from 37 to 46, gone on 47.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,6) is obstacle.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (3,6) is blocked, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nBody: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTail is (5,5)\n\nSince head direction is down, last move was down to (4,3).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right? But no instant reverse, so I cannot move up because that would be opposite to down.\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so I can move down (continue down), left, or right. Up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo actions: D, L, or R.\n\nNow, let's see where I can move:\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- Down (D): to (4,2) — but y=2, which is within 1 to 6, and (4,2) is not occupied by body or wall? Let's check body positions.\n\nBody: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). None at (4,2), so (4,2) is empty? Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so y=2 is not wall. Internal obstacles only (3,6), so (4,2) should be free.\n\n- Left (L): to (3,3) — x=3, y=3. Body positions: (3,4) is body, but (3,3) not listed, so should be free. Not wall.\n\n- Right (R): to (5,3) — (5,3) not in body, not wall.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (4,6): food at (4,6)\n\n- (6,5): food at (6,5)\n\n- (1,6): food at (1,6)\n\nAll with value +1.\n\nI need to think about getting to food safely.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n\nTail is at (5,5). Where is head? (4,3). Not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(4,3) to (5,5): delta x=1, delta y=2, not adjacent; it's diagonal or something. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |2| = 3, not 1, so not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (4,6). It has short life span, only until turn 38.\n\nTurn 37: life span 2, so after this turn, it becomes 1, and after turn 38, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\nSimilarly, others have longer life.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), which is above the head. Head at (4,3), so (4,6) is up, but y=6 is the top row? y=7 is wall, y=6 is border? No, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but (3,6) is obstacle, so (4,6) might be accessible.\n\ny=6: since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the top row, but not wall, it's playable.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked, but (4,6) is different cell.\n\n(4,6): x=4, y=6. Walls: y=7 is wall, so y=6 is not wall. x=4, not wall. And not (3,6), so (4,6) is free except for the food.\n\nBut food is there, so it's occupied by food.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (4,6).\n\nFrom current position (4,3), I can go up, but current direction is down, and I cannot reverse to up immediately because no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so I cannot move up on this turn. Only D, L, R.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can go down to (4,2), left to (3,3), or right to (5,3).\n\n(4,6) is up, so I need to eventually go up, but not this turn.\n\nTo reach (4,6) by turn 38, I have two turns: this turn (37) and next (38).\n\nTurn 37: I move somewhere.\n\nThen turn 38: I can move to (4,6) if possible.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), head at (4,3), so I need to move up three times: from y=3 to y=4, y=5, y=6.\n\nBut I can only move one per turn, so to be at (4,6) on turn 38, I need to be at (4,5) on turn 37 after move? Let's think.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, head position for turn 38.\n\nCurrently turn 37, before move, head at (4,3).\n\nAfter I move, say to some position, that becomes the new head for turn 37.\n\nThen on turn 38, I move from there.\n\nTo be at (4,6) on turn 38, I need to move to (4,6) during turn 38.\n\nSo for that, on turn 38, head must be adjacent to (4,6) and I choose to move there.\n\n(4,6) has neighbors: (4,5) north, (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid; (3,6) west, but (3,6) is obstacle; (5,6) east; and (4,5) south? Let's see directions.\n\n(4,6): possible moves to it: from (4,5) down to (4,6)? Coordinates: if (4,5) to (4,6) is up? U is (x,y+1), so from (4,5) moving up to (4,6).\n\nD is (x,y-1), down.\n\nSo to move to (4,6), I can come from:\n\n- North: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- South: (4,5) moving up to (4,6)\n\n- East: (5,6) moving left to (4,6)\n\n- West: (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by the snake body. Snake positions include (4,5), which is the 9th segment? List: positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied by body segment 8.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is not occupied, I think.\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6, not in body, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBut to reach (4,6) from (5,6), I need to be at (5,6) and move left to (4,6).\n\nBut (5,6) might not be accessible easily.\n\nFrom current position, to get to (4,5) or (5,6) by turn 38.\n\nFirst, (4,5) is currently occupied, but when the snake moves, the body moves, so on turn 37, after I move, the snake will move: head moves to new position, and tail might move or not depending on food.\n\nIf I don't eat food, tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, on turn 37, before move, head at (4,3), body follows.\n\nAfter I move to a new cell, say to P, then the new head is at P, and the body segments shift: the old head becomes part of body, so (4,3) becomes body segment 1, (4,4) becomes segment 2, and so on, and the tail (5,5) is removed if no food eaten, or stays if food eaten.\n\nSince I'm moving, and not necessarily eating food, the tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, on turn 37, after I move to a direction, the head moves, and if the new cell has food, I eat it and grow, so tail doesn't move. If no food, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (4,5), it is currently occupied, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's simulate the movement.\n\nCurrent state turn 37, snake positions: H: (4,3), B1: (4,4), B2: (3,4), B3: (2,4), B4: (1,4), B5: (1,5), B6: (2,5), B7: (3,5), B8: (4,5), B9: (5,5) tail.\n\nNow, I choose a move for turn 37.\n\nOptions: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nSuppose I move to (4,2) down.\n\nThen new head: (4,2)\n\nBody: the previous head (4,3) becomes new body segment 1, then B1 (4,4) becomes segment 2, B2 (3,4) segment 3, and so on, up to B8 (4,5) segment 9, and tail B9 (5,5) is removed since no food eaten (assuming (4,2) has no food).\n\n(4,2) has food? Food is at (4,6), (6,5), (1,6), not (4,2), so no food, so tail is removed, new positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — so (5,5) gone, and (4,5) is now the tail? Positions: after move down to (4,2), new head (4,2), then body: old head (4,3) is now first body, then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So segments: head (4,2), B1 (4,3), B2 (4,4), B3 (3,4), B4 (2,4), B5 (1,4), B6 (1,5), B7 (2,5), B8 (3,5), B9 (4,5) tail. So tail at (4,5).\n\nPreviously tail was at (5,5), now at (4,5).\n\nAnd (5,5) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,3): new head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5) removed, so new tail at (4,5).\n\nIf move right to (5,3): new head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5) removed? B9 was (5,5), removed, so tail at (4,5).\n\nIn all cases, since no food eaten, tail moves away, and (4,5) becomes the new tail or part of body.\n\nBut in the new positions, (4,5) is occupied.\n\nNow back to reaching (4,6).\n\nTo eat food at (4,6) on turn 38, I need to be at a position on turn 38 where I can move to (4,6).\n\nPossible approach cells: (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5): on turn 38, if I am at (4,5), I can move up to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,5) might be occupied by the snake at that time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) I can move left to (4,6).\n\nNow, let's see the state on turn 38.\n\nFirst, I need to decide turn 37 move.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) has life span 2 at turn 37, so on turn 38, life span 1, still there, can be eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat it by turn 38, it disappears.\n\nSo only two chances.\n\nBut to get to (4,5) quickly, from current (4,3), I need to go up, but I can't this turn because direction down, no reverse.\n\nSo on turn 37, I must move D, L, or R, not U.\n\nSo I can't go up immediately.\n\nThe shortest path to (4,5) is two moves: for example, this turn move to (3,3) or (5,3), then next turn to (3,4) or (5,4), but not directly to (4,4) because I can't go up.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move left to (3,3), then on turn 38, from (3,3) I can move up to (3,4), or right to (4,3), etc., but (3,4) is not (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at x=4,y=5.\n\nFrom (4,3), I need to increase y by 2.\n\nBut I can only move one step per turn, and this turn I can't move up.\n\nSo after turn 37 move, I will be at one of: (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\nThen on turn 38, I can move from there.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), left to (3,2), right to (5,2), or down to (4,1) but y=1 is ok.\n\nBut (4,3) might be body.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move up to (3,4), down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly from (5,3): up to (5,4), down to (5,2), left to (4,3), right to (6,3) but x=6, not wall? x=7 wall, so x=6 ok.\n\nNone of these are (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nTo reach (4,5) on turn 38, I need to be at (4,5) on turn 38 after move, but to be at (4,5) on turn 38, I need to move to (4,5) during turn 38, so on turn 38 before move, I need to be adjacent to (4,5) and move there.\n\nSo for turn 38, the head position before move must be adjacent to (4,5).\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,5): (4,4) north, (4,6) south, (3,5) west, (5,5) east.\n\n(4,6) is the food cell, (4,4) is body, (3,5) is body, (5,5) is tail.\n\nCurrently, on turn 37 before move, (4,4) is body segment 1, (3,5) is body segment 7, (5,5) is tail.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, the body shifts.\n\nLet's simulate for each possible turn 37 move.\n\nFirst, suppose I move down to (4,2) on turn 37.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo on turn 38, before move, head at (4,2), and (4,5) is tail.\n\nAdjacent to (4,5): (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n\n(4,4) is body segment 2, occupied.\n\n(4,6) is food, free.\n\n(3,5) is body segment 8, occupied.\n\n(5,5) is free, since not in positions; after turn 37, positions are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), so (5,5) is free.\n\nSo (5,5) is free and adjacent to (4,5).\n\nBut to reach (4,5), I need to be at one of its adjacent cells on turn 38.\n\nOn turn 38, from head at (4,2), I can move to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, so if I move there, collision.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,2), (5,2), or (4,1).\n\nNone of which are adjacent to (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can only reach cells around it, not near (4,5) in one move.\n\n(4,5) is at distance, so I can't reach it directly from (4,2) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,3) on turn 37.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nOn turn 38, head at (3,3), can move to (3,4), but (3,4) is body segment 3, occupied; or (3,2), (2,3), (4,3) body segment 1, occupied. (4,3) is body, so moving there would collide.\n\nAvailable moves: from (3,3) to (3,4) occupied, to (3,2) free, to (2,3) free, to (4,3) occupied. So only (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nNot near (4,5).\n\nIf move right to (5,3) on turn 37: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nOn turn 38, head at (5,3), can move to (5,4), (5,2), (4,3) occupied, (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is free, I think; not in body positions.\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), etc., (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2), (6,3) free.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has adjacent (5,5), which might be free.\n\nBut from (5,3), moving to (5,4) on turn 38 gets me to (5,4), not to (4,5).\n\nTo be able to move to (4,5) on turn 38, I need to be at (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), or (5,5) on turn 38 before move.\n\nBut on turn 38, after turn 37 move, those cells might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's list the cells around (4,5) on turn 38 after turn 37 move.\n\nFor example, after any turn 37 move, the body has shifted, so (4,4) and (3,5) are likely still body, but let's see.\n\nIn general, after turn 37 move to a new head position, the first body segment is the previous head (4,3), then (4,4), etc., so (4,4) becomes segment 2 or something.\n\nIn the new positions, (4,4) is still body, (3,5) is body, (4,5) is tail, (5,5) is free.\n\n(4,6) is food, free.\n\n(5,5) is free and adjacent to (4,5).\n\nBut to move to (4,5) from (5,5), I need to be at (5,5) and move left to (4,5).\n\nSo if on turn 38, head is at (5,5), I can move left to (4,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is currently tail, but after turn 37 move, if I don't eat food, tail moves, so (5,5) is free.\n\nOn turn 38, if I can have head at (5,5), then move to (4,5).\n\nBut to be at (5,5) on turn 38, I need to move there during turn 38, so on turn 38 before move, I need to be adjacent to (5,5) and move there.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps it's impossible to reach (4,5) by turn 38 to eat the food.\n\nBecause from current position, I can't get close enough in one move since I can't go up this turn.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, the closest I can be to (4,5) is, for example, if I move to (4,2), I'm at (4,2), far away.\n\nIf I move to (3,3), at (3,3), still not close.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), at (5,3), a bit closer but still |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |2| = 3 to (4,5), so two moves away.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nThe only way to reach (4,5) quickly is if I can be at (4,4) or something, but (4,4) is body and I can't move there.\n\nOn turn 38, if (4,4) is free, I could move to it, but it won't be free because it's part of the body.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, (4,4) is still body, unless I eat food and it grows, but I don't eat food on turn 37.\n\nSo (4,4) remains occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) occupied.\n\n(4,6) is food, free.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nSo the only adjacent cell to (4,5) that might be free is (5,5) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is food, so I can move to (4,6) directly if I can.\n\nBut for (4,5), to eat the food there? No, food is at (4,6), not at (4,5).\n\nI want to eat food at (4,6), not at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is a cell I might need to be on to access (4,6).\n\nTo move to (4,6), I can come from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is currently body, and after turn 37 move, it will be the tail or body.\n\nIn the new positions after turn 37 move to any direction, (4,5) is the tail, as we saw earlier.\n\nFor example, after move to (4,2): tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,3): tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,3): tail at (4,5)\n\nSo on turn 38, before move, the tail is at (4,5), which is occupied.\n\nSo I cannot move to (4,5) because it's occupied by the tail.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is free, but not adjacent to (4,6) for moving to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) can be accessed from (4,5) or (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so only from (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is free.\n\nBut to move to (4,6) from (5,6), I need to be at (5,6) and move left.\n\nBut (5,6) is not adjacent to current positions.\n\nFrom current (4,3), to reach (5,6), I need to go right and up, but this turn I can only go D, L, R, not U.\n\nSo minimum two moves to reach (5,6), but I have only one move before turn 38.\n\nOn turn 37, I move to say (5,3) right, then on turn 38, from (5,3) I can move to (5,4), not to (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,6) is three moves up, impossible in one turn.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot reach any cell that allows me to move to (4,6) on turn 38.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (4,6) on turn 38, because I cannot be in a position to move to it.\n\nOn turn 37, if I could move to a cell adjacent to (4,6), but (4,6) is at (4,6), adjacent cells are (4,5), (4,7) invalid, (3,6) obstacle, (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is occupied, (5,6) is free, but from current (4,3), I can't reach (5,6) in one move since no up move.\n\nSo also impossible to move directly to (4,6) on turn 37 from current position.\n\nThus, the food at (4,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 38 without being eaten.\n\nSo I should forget about that food and focus on other food or long-term survival.\n\nNow, other food: (6,5) with life span 7, so available from turn 37 to 43.\n\nAnd (1,6) with life span 10, available to 46.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction down.\n\nI need to think about path to other food.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 walls, internal (3,6) obstacle.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 except (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: from (4,3) to tail at (5,5).\n\nThe snake is somewhat coiled; let's plot the positions to see.\n\nList cells:\n\nRow y=6: cells (1,6) food, (2,6), (3,6) obstacle, (4,6) food, (5,6), (6,6)\n\nBut (3,6) obstacle, (4,6) food.\n\ny=5: (1,5) body, (2,5) body, (3,5) body, (4,5) body, (5,5) tail, (6,5) food\n\ny=4: (1,4) body, (2,4) body, (3,4) body, (4,4) body, (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) head, (5,3), (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nOn y=5, (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) occupied, (6,5) food.\n\nOn y=4, (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) occupied, (5,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\netc.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should aim for the food at (6,5) or (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is far, at (1,6), head at (4,3), so |dx| + |dy| = 3+3=6, but with body in between, need to navigate.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if I go near tail when it has food, but currently no food on tail, and tail is moving.\n\nBut food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n\nBut in this case, no food under body now.\n\nNow, possible moves turn 37: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the snake will move, and body positions change.\n\nMoreover, I need to avoid dead ends or collisions.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate each move for turn 37.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (4,2)\n\nThen new head: (4,2)\n\nDirection: since moved down, new direction down.\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2), not U because no reverse, direction down.\n\n(4,1) is free, (3,2) free, (5,2) free.\n\nNo food there.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (6,5) or other.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), from (4,2), I need to go right and up.\n\nSimilarly, option 2: Move left to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), direction left (since moved left).\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nFrom (3,3), can move L to (2,3), D to (3,2), U to (3,4)? U is (x,y+1), to (3,4), but (3,4) is body segment 3, occupied, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,3) body segment 1, occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves: L to (2,3) or D to (3,2), since U and R are occupied or invalid.\n\nU to (3,4) occupied, R to (4,3) occupied, so only L or D.\n\n(2,3) and (3,2) are free.\n\nOption 3: Move right to (5,3)\n\nNew head (5,3), direction right.\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nFrom (5,3), can move R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (4,3) occupied, so cannot.\n\nU to (5,4) free, D to (5,2) free, R to (6,3) free.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\n- If I move down to (4,2), I am closer to bottom, but (6,5) is top-right, so not direct.\n\n- Move left to (3,3): I might get stuck because only two moves possible next turn, L or D, both of which might lead to dead end or limited space.\n\n- Move right to (5,3): I can then go to (5,4) or (6,3), which is closer to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), from (5,3) I can go up to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (6,4), etc.\n\n(5,5) is currently tail, but after move, it might be free later.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,5).\n\nMoreover, (1,6) is another option.\n\nBut let's think about the space.\n\nThe snake has 10 segments, so it occupies 10 cells, grid has 6x6 = 36 cells minus obstacle (3,6), so 35 cells, minus snake 10, 25 free, but some have food.\n\nFood at (4,6) will disappear, (6,5), (1,6).\n\nBut (4,6) will be gone soon.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to have space to move.\n\nThe bottom-left area has body at (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), etc., so bottom is somewhat occupied.\n\nTop-right has food at (6,5).\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), so y=6 is partially blocked.\n\nLet's consider moving right to (5,3) on turn 37.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (5,4) on turn 38.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (5,3)\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 38: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), or R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is free, so move U to (5,4).\n\nThen new head (5,4), and if no food, tail (4,5) removed, new body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), tail at (3,5)? Positions: head to (5,4), then body: old head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) removed, so tail at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is now tail.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (6,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) is food at (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move right to (6,4) or up to (5,5) or down to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied, or left to (4,4) body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible: U to (5,5) or R to (6,4) or D to (5,3) occupied, so only U or R.\n\n(5,5) is free? Currently not occupied, so yes.\n\n(6,4) free.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) on turn 39? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 38: move U to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nNow turn 39: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), R to (6,4), or D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body segment 1, occupied, so cannot. L to (4,4) body segment 3, occupied. So only U or R.\n\nMove U to (5,5): then (5,5) is free, so move there.\n\nNew head (5,5), and since no food, tail (3,5) removed, body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail at (2,5).\n\n(5,5) has no food, so tail removed.\n\nFood is at (6,5), not (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nTurn 39: head at (5,5), can move U to (5,6), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) body, occupied, L to (4,5) but (4,5) not in body now, after move to (5,5), body: (5,4), (5,3), etc., (4,5) is free? Positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail. (4,5) not in list, so free.\n\nBut to move to (6,5), from (5,5) I can move right to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food, so I can eat it on turn 40 if I go there.\n\nLet's outline the turns.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 38: move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 39: move U to (5,5)  // or to (6,4), but to (5,5)\n\nFrom (5,4), on turn 39, I move U to (5,5)\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nNow, (6,5) is adjacent right, and has food.\n\nOn turn 40, I can move R to (6,5) to eat it.\n\nThen, since I eat food, length increases, tail doesn't move, so new head at (6,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail stays, so 11 segments.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut is this safe? On turn 40, moving to (6,5), which is food, so I eat and grow.\n\nBut before that, on turn 39, at (5,5), moving to (6,5) is fine.\n\nNow, what about the direction: after turn 38 move U to (5,4), direction up.\n\nThen turn 39 move U to (5,5), direction up.\n\nThen turn 40 move R to (6,5), which is right, not reverse, so ok.\n\nNow, but I need to think if there are risks.\n\nAnother option: on turn 39 from (5,4), I could move R to (6,4) instead of U to (5,5).\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move up to (6,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 37: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 38: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 39: R to (6,4)\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nThen turn 40: from (6,4), can move U to (6,5) to eat food, or D to (6,3), L to (5,4) body, occupied, R to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nMove U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut with first plan, I go to (5,5) first, then to (6,5).\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (6,5) on turn 40.\n\nTurn 37: move\n\nTurn 38: move\n\nTurn 39: move to (5,5) or (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: move to (6,5) to eat.\n\nSo eaten on turn 40.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 7 at turn 37, so on turn 40, which is 3 turns later, life span decreases to 4, still there, ok.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (1,6) is far, and I can get it later if possible.\n\nBut with this move, I eat (6,5) on turn 40.\n\nNow, what if I move down or left on turn 37?\n\nFor example, if I move down to (4,2), then I am away from the food.\n\nThen to reach (6,5), I need to go right and up, which might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if move left to (3,3), I might be constrained.\n\nFor instance, after moving left to (3,3), on turn 38 I can only move to (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nSay move to (2,3), then from there, I can go to (2,4) but occupied, or (2,2), or (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) food is there, but I need to navigate around the body.\n\nIt might be riskier because the body is in the area.\n\nWhereas moving right seems to open up space towards the food.\n\nAlso, long-term, after eating (6,5), I can explore other areas.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: when I eat at (6,5), the tail is at (2,5), not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, no issue.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (1,6) has long life, I can get it later.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving right is safe for the first few turns.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (5,3) - free, no issue.\n\nTurn 38: move U to (5,4) - free, no issue.\n\nTurn 39: move U to (5,5) - free, no issue. (5,5) was tail but moved away.\n\nThen turn 40: move R to (6,5) - eat food, grow.\n\nNow, after that, I need to move away, but since I eat, tail stays, so the body is longer.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to (6,4) or (6,6) but y=6, (6,6) is free? x=6,y=6, not wall, no obstacle.\n\ny=6 is playable except (3,6) obstacle.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\nOr to (5,5) but (5,5) is now body? After eating, positions: head to (6,5), body includes (5,5), since previous head was (5,5), so (5,5) is body now.\n\nAfter turn 40 move to (6,5), head (6,5), body: previous head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), and since ate food, tail doesn't move, so (2,5) is still there, but new segment added? When eat food, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail position stays.\n\nPositions: new head (6,5), then the previous body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), and since ate, the tail (2,5) remains, but a new segment is added, so the snake grows, positions: head (6,5), then segment 1: (5,5), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (5,3), seg4: (4,3), seg5: (4,4), seg6: (3,4), seg7: (2,4), seg8: (1,4), seg9: (1,5), seg10: (2,5), and new tail: (2,5) or since tail was (2,5), it stays and new segment, but the tail position is fixed, so the new tail is (2,5), and the segment before is (1,5), etc.\n\nAfter eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new body segment is added at the tail position. So the tail position remains, but now it's not the tail anymore; the segment before becomes the new tail? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow by adding a new segment at the tail. So after moving, the head is at new position, the body shifts, and if you ate food, instead of removing the tail, you keep it, so the tail stays, and the snake is longer.\n\nSo in positions, after move to food, the new head is at food, then the previous head becomes first body, and so on, up to the previous tail, which is still there, and since you ate, no removal, so the tail remains in place as part of body, and the new tail is the same as before, but since you grow, the segment that was second last becomes new tail or something.\n\nLet's think: before move, positions: head, b1, b2, ..., b_k, tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell:\n\n- If no food: head moves to new, b1 moves to head old, b2 to b1 old, ..., tail moves away, so positions: new head, old head, old b1, ..., old b_{k-1}, and old tail removed.\n\n- If food: head moves to new (food), b1 moves to head old, b2 to b1 old, ..., tail stays, so positions: new head, old head, old b1, ..., old tail, and no removal, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, after turn 39, positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nThen turn 40: move to (6,5), which has food, so new head (6,5), then body: old head (5,5), old body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), and old tail (2,5) stays, so positions: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) with (2,5) as tail.\n\nNow from (6,5), I can move to (6,4), (6,6), or (5,5) but (5,5) is body, occupied, or left to (5,5) occupied, so only down to (6,4) or up to (6,6) or right to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nBoth free, say move to (6,6) or something.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for the plan, I can eat the food safely.\n\nNow, what if on turn 37 I move down or left?\n\nFor example, move down to (4,2): then I need to go up later, but I can, but it might take longer to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, move left: to (3,3), then on turn 38, I can only move to (2,3) or (3,2), both not towards food.\n\nThen it might be inefficient.\n\nMoreover, moving left might lead to a confined space with the body.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (1,3), but (1,4) and (1,5) are body, so limited moves.\n\nWhereas moving right opens space.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6), but it has long life, I can go there after, but for now, (6,5) is closer and has shorter life relatively? Life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\n(1,6) life span 10, also long.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near the current position after moving right.\n\nDistance: from (4,3) to (6,5): |dx| + |dy| = 2 + 2 = 4, so with the path, I can reach in 3 moves as above.\n\nIf I go directly, but with constraints.\n\nIn the plan, I reach on turn 40.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output multiple turns, but the state is at turn 37, and I need to specify actions for turn 37, 38, 39, etc., at least 5 turns ahead? Think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions.\n\nThe answer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=37.\n\nSo I should specify actions for turn 37,38,39,40,41, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the plan, I can do for a few turns.\n\nSince I have a clear path to food, I can output that.\n\nIn the move to (5,5) on turn 39, (5,5) is free, but earlier it was tail, but after moves, it is free.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 39 moving to (5,5), it is free.\n\nSimilarly, no collision.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), but not in the way.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not an issue.\n\nSo moving right on turn 37 seems good.\n\nBut I need to consider if moving down or left has advantages.\n\nSuppose I move down to (4,2) on turn 37.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move to say (5,2) or (4,1), then eventually up, but to reach (6,5), it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), from (4,2), I can go left and up, but the body is there.\n\nFor example, positions around (1,6): (1,6) food, but (1,4), (1,5) body, (2,4), (2,5) body, so to reach (1,6), I need to go to (1,5) or (2,6) or (1,7) invalid.\n\n(1,5) is body, so when it moves away.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nWhereas moving right, I eat (6,5) quickly, then I can go towards (1,6) later.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I grow, which might make movement harder, but I have more space.\n\nThe grid has 35 cells, snake 10, after eat 11, still 24 free, with two food but one will disappear.\n\n(4,6) disappears soon.\n\nThen only (1,6) food left.\n\nBut I can survive by not hitting walls or body.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat all food if possible.\n\n(1,6) has life span 10, so by turn 46, I can eat it.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) on turn 40, head at (6,5), I can move to (6,6) or (6,4), say to (6,6), then to (6,7) invalid, or (5,6), etc.\n\n(5,6) is free, then I can go left towards (1,6).\n\nBut need to avoid the body.\n\nThe body is from (6,5) to (2,5), so around y=5 and below.\n\nI can go to top row.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) after eating, move to (6,6), then to (5,6), (4,6) but (4,6) food might be gone, life span 2, at turn 37, so on turn 40, it is gone? Turn 37: life span 2, turn 38:1, turn 39:0 gone. So on turn 40, (4,6) gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) free, (4,6) gone, (3,6) obstacle, so (4,6) not accessible.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go to (5,6), then to (4,6) gone, so (5,6) to (4,6) invalid, or to (5,5) but (5,5) body, etc.\n\nAfter turn 40, positions include (5,5) body.\n\nBut I can move to (5,6) from (6,6), then from (5,6) I can go left to (4,6) but gone, or down to (5,5) body, or to (5,7) invalid. (5,6) to (4,6) gone, (3,6) obstacle, so only down to (5,5) body or up invalid? y=6, U to (5,7) invalid wall, D to (5,5) body, L to (4,6) gone, R to (6,6) but just left.\n\n(5,6) has only one neighbor: (5,5), since (4,6) gone, (3,6) obstacle, (5,7) invalid, (6,6) is another cell.\n\n(5,6) adjacent: (5,5), (5,7) invalid, (4,6) gone, (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is separate.\n\nSo from (5,6), I can go to (6,6) or to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is body, so only to (6,6) if I came from there.\n\nBut if I go to (5,6) from (6,6), then from (5,6), I can only go back to (6,6) or to (5,5) which is body, collision.\n\nSo (5,6) might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nIn this case, after (4,6) gone, (3,6) obstacle, (5,6) has only two neighbors: (5,5) and (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is likely body, (6,6) might be free.\n\nBut if I am at (5,6), and (5,5) is body, I can only move to (6,6) if possible.\n\nBut not a problem if I don't go there.\n\nIn the plan, after eating at (6,5), I should not go to (5,6) immediately.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), move to (6,4) down.\n\n(6,4) free, then to (6,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nThen I can go left towards (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), I need to reach it.\n\nBut it might be far, but possible.\n\nSince the focus is on the immediate moves, and moving right on turn 37 allows me to eat food quickly.\n\nNow, back to turn 37, if I move left to (3,3), it might be riskier.\n\nFor example, turn 37: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 38: from (3,3), only can move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2)\n\nSay move L to (2,3)\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) tail? After move to (2,3), body: old head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) removed, tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (2,3), can move to (2,2), (2,4) occupied, (1,3), (3,3) body, so only (2,2) or (1,3).\n\nThen if move to (1,3), then to (1,2) or (1,4) occupied, etc.\n\nBut (1,6) food, I can try to go up, but (1,4) and (1,5) body, so need to wait or go around.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,6), I need to be at (1,5) or (2,6) or (1,7) invalid.\n\n(1,5) is body, so when it moves away.\n\nBut it might take time, and I might not get to eat (6,5) because it has shorter life relatively? Both have time, but (6,5) might be easier to reach from current.\n\nMoreover, moving left, I am going towards the body cluster.\n\nSo moving right seems better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 37, I should move right to (5,3).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per plan.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the plan involves going to (5,4) then (5,5) then (6,5), but on turn 38, from (5,3) I move U to (5,4), then turn 39 U to (5,5), turn 40 R to (6,5).\n\nBut on turn 39, from (5,4), I could move R to (6,4) instead, then turn 40 U to (6,5).\n\nEither is fine.\n\nBut moving to (5,5) first might be better because it frees space or something.\n\nIn terms of direction, from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) keeps direction up, then to (6,5) right.\n\nIf I move R to (6,4), direction right, then U to (6,5).\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let's see the space: after moving to (5,5), then to (6,5), I have more options to go to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nIf I go to (6,4) first, then to (6,5), I might be constrained if (6,4) has fewer exits, but (6,4) can go to (6,3), (6,5), (5,4) but (5,4) might be body.\n\nIn the sequence, when at (6,4), (5,4) is body, so only (6,3) or (6,5).\n\nBut since I go to (6,5) next, it's fine.\n\nI think both are ok.\n\nI'll go with moving up to (5,5) on turn 39.\n\nNow for turn 41 and beyond, I don't need to specify, but for the output, I can put up to turn 40 or so.\n\nThe answer should include actions for turn 37, 38, 39, ... for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI think for 5 turns: turn 37 to 41.\n\nBut after turn 40, I eat, then I need to move.\n\nFor example, after eating at (6,5) on turn 40, I can move to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nSay move to (6,6) on turn 41.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can output until the food is eaten.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, and I eat one food, that's good.\n\nNow, about the food at (1,6), I can plan to get it later, but for the output, I don't need to go that far.\n\nNow, in the initial state, head direction down, but when I move right, direction changes to right.\n\nNo problem with reverse since I'm not going opposite immediately.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 37: R (right) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 38: U (up) to (5,4)\n\nTurn 39: U (up) to (5,5)\n\nTurn 40: R (right) to (6,5) eat food\n\nThen turn 41: say U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), but I need to specify.\n\nTo have 5 turns, I can add turn 41.\n\nBut the food is eaten on turn 40, so for survival, I can go to (6,6) on turn 41.\n\n(6,6) free, move U.\n\nDirection after turn 40 move R, so direction right.\n\nThen turn 41, from (6,5) move U to (6,6), not reverse, ok.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5) body, etc., but not necessary.\n\nI think outputting until turn 41 is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the grid.\n\ny=6: cells (1,6) food, (2,6), (3,6) obstacle, (4,6) food but gone by turn 40, (5,6), (6,6)\n\n(5,6) and (6,6) free.\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6, not wall.\n\nSo move U to (6,6) on turn 41.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, the plan involves moving towards the food at (6,5) to eat it safely on turn 40. This food has a life span of 7, meaning it will disappear after turn 43, so eating it on turn 40 is feasible. The food at (4,6) has a short life span (disappears after turn 38) and cannot be reached safely by turn 38 due to movement constraints and body positions, so it is ignored. The food at (1,6) has a long life span (disappears after turn 46) and can be targeted later if possible.\n\nThe initial head direction is down, so on turn 37, the snake cannot move up (reverse). The chosen path avoids collisions, leverages body movement to free space, and positions the snake to eat (6,5) efficiently. After eating, the snake grows, and subsequent moves focus on survival by moving to open spaces.\n\n### Plan Details:\n- **Turn 37 (current turn)**: Move right (R) to (5,3). This moves towards the food at (6,5) and avoids the body cluster on the left. Direction changes to right.\n- **Turn 38**: Move up (U) to (5,4). This continues toward (6,5) and positions for the next move. Direction changes to up.\n- **Turn 39**: Move up (U) to (5,5). This cell is now free (tail moved away), and it adjacent to (6,5). Direction remains up.\n- **Turn 40**: Move right (R) to (6,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 11). Direction changes to right.\n- **Turn 41**: Move up (U) to (6,6). This moves to a free cell to avoid immediate collision risks and opens options for future moves toward (1,6) or other areas.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Safety**: No collisions occur. On turn 39, (5,5) is free (previous tail position vacated). On turn 40, eating at (6,5) is safe as the tail is at (2,5), not adjacent. The path avoids walls and obstacles.\n- **Efficiency**: (6,5) is eaten in 4 turns (turn 40), within its life span. Moving right initially avoids the congested left side.\n- **Long-term**: After eating, moving to (6,6) on turn 41 provides flexibility to navigate toward (1,6) later. The grid has sufficient space (25 free cells initially, 24 after growth), and the snake can survive by avoiding dead ends.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Tail reward danger is irrelevant here (no food near tail). The plan thinks 5+ turns ahead, ensuring survival beyond immediate rewards.\n\n### Full Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: R (right)  \nTurn 38: U (up)  \nTurn 39: U (up)  \nTurn 40: R (right)  \nTurn 41: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 38, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake is 10 units long.\n\nHead direction is Right (R), meaning it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if I don't eat it now, it vanishes.\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 6. Positive food.\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Also positive.\n\nAll food has value 1, so no negative food here. That simplifies things.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,3), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, or Right, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is Right, so I cannot move Left immediately because that would be an instant reverse. So Left is invalid.\n\nValid moves: Up, Down, Right.\n\nNow, I need to consider the grid. Let me sketch this mentally or on paper.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, or to (3,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body: positions from head to tail:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 7: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,5)\n\n- Tail: (4,5) is the last one? Positions are given as a list of 10: index 0 to 9.\n\n(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So tail is at (4,5).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,6): life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n\n- (6,5): life span 6\n\n- (1,6): life span 9\n\nAll value 1.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer should include actions from turn 38 onwards, but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably I need to output a sequence, but since future states depend on actions, I should plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I should decide the immediate action and then the next ones based on that.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food with short life span: (4,6) must be eaten now or lost.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4, y=6.\n\nCurrent head at (5,3). How to get to (4,6)?\n\nFrom (5,3), to reach (4,6), I need to move left and up, but moving left is invalid because current direction is right, cannot reverse.\n\nValid moves: U, D, R.\n\nIf I go Up from (5,3) to (5,4)\n\nDown to (5,2) but y=2 is within bounds, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is ok.\n\nRight to (6,3)\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,3), I can't reach it directly because I can only move one step, and left is not allowed.\n\nThis turn, turn 38, I can only move to adjacent cells: (5,4) up, (5,2) down, or (6,3) right.\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (5,3); it's two steps away: left to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, and I can't move there because it's a body segment except the tail.\n\nMoving to a body segment is deadly, except for the tail, because when I move, the tail moves, so if I move to the tail cell, it's ok as long as the tail moves away.\n\nLet's check if (4,6) is adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (5,3), adjacent cells: (5,4) up, (5,2) down, (6,3) right, (4,3) left. But left is invalid move, and (4,3) is occupied by body, so I can't move there anyway because it's not the tail; it's the first segment.\n\n(4,3) is the segment right after head, so if I move left to (4,3), I collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is not adjacent, so I cannot eat (4,6) this turn, turn 38.\n\nSince life span is 1, and it's turn 38, if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn. So I cannot eat it; it will vanish.\n\nTherefore, (4,6) is not available for eating; it will be gone after turn 38.\n\nSo, I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nFood left: (6,5) and (1,6)\n\nNow, (6,5) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 38 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten in turns from t to t+L-1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe state says \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", with countdown decreasing every turn including current.\n\nFor food at (4,6), life_span=1 at turn 38.\n\nAfter turn 38, countdown decreases to 0, and it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 38 if head is on it at the end of turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,5), life_span=6 at turn 38, so countdown from 6 to 0, disappears after turn 43 (since 38 + 6 -1 =43? Let's think).\n\nTurn 38: life_span=6, after turn 38, it decreases to 5.\n\nAfter turn 39, to 4, and so on, down to 0 after turn 43, so it disappears after turn 43, meaning it can be eaten from turn 38 to turn 43 inclusive? When is it eaten?\n\nTypically, at the start of turn, we have state, then snake moves, and if head is on food, it eats it.\n\nSo for a food with life_span L at turn t, it can be eaten in turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and after turn t+L-1, it disappears before turn t+L.\n\nFor (4,6) at turn 38: L=1, can be eaten only on turn 38.\n\nFor (6,5): L=6 at turn 38, can be eaten from turn 38 to turn 43 (since turn 38 + 5 =43? Turns: t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n\nt=38, L=6, so turns 38,39,40,41,42,43. That's 6 turns: 38 to 43 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nAfter turn 43, before turn 44, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): L=9, can be eaten from turn 38 to 46.\n\nNow, back to action.\n\nSince I can't eat (4,6), I should plan to eat other food.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3):\n\n- Up to (5,4)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Right to (6,3)\n\nLeft is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think about safety and accessing food.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,5).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Head (5,3), tail (4,5). Distance: |5-4|=1, |3-5|=2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so same x, |dy|=1 or same y, |dx|=1.\n\n(5,3) and (4,5): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, let's consider each move.\n\nFirst, move Up to (5,4): what is at (5,4)? Is it free?\n\nCurrent snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), etc. (5,4) is not listed, so it should be free, but let's check walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders and (3,6). (5,4) is within bounds, not (3,6), so free.\n\nMove to (5,4), then head is at (5,4), direction Up.\n\nThen snake body: new head (5,4), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, and tail moves away? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves to where the second last was.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving Up to (5,4):\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nThen body segments: the old head (5,3) becomes new segment 1, so positions: new head (5,4), then (5,3), then the old segment 1: (4,3), but (4,3) was segment 1, now it becomes segment 2, and so on, up to old segment 8: (3,5) becomes segment 9, and old tail (4,5) is no longer part of snake, so tail is at old segment 8 position, (3,5)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head: (5,4)  // new position\n\n- Segment 1: (5,3)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2: (4,3)  // previous segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: (4,4)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)  // previous segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (2,4)  // previous segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (1,4)  // previous segment 5\n\n- Segment 7: (1,5)  // previous segment 6\n\n- Segment 8: (2,5)  // previous segment 7\n\n- Segment 9: (3,5)  // previous segment 8\n\nPrevious segment 9 was (4,5), but since tail moves, (4,5) is vacated, and segment 9 is now (3,5), which was previous segment 8.\n\nThe snake shortens by the tail moving, but since no food eaten, length same, so the last segment is removed.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,4), then the first body segment is the old head (5,3), then old segment 1 (4,3), then old segment 2 (4,4), ..., up to old segment 8 (3,5), and old segment 9 (4,5) is dropped. So tail is now at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut for now, if I move Up to (5,4), no food there, so snake moves, no growth.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction Up.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is now body, cannot move there, L to (4,4) which is body, cannot, R to (6,4).\n\nSo only U or R possible? Current direction after move is Up, so cannot move Down (reverse).\n\nValid moves: since direction is Up, cannot go Down.\n\nSo from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body segment, occupied, cannot move there, or R to (6,4), which is free? (6,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4, walls at x=7, not x=6, y=4 within 0-7, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nNow, similarly for other initial moves.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (1,6).\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is near.\n\nFrom current position (5,3), if I go Right to (6,3), that might be good to approach (6,5).\n\nIf I go Down to (5,2), that might be away.\n\nIf I go Up to (5,4), then I can go to (5,5) or (6,4), both closer to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) life span 6, so I have time.\n\n(1,6) is far, life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends and plan for survival.\n\nCurrent snake body occupies a lot of space; let's see the grid.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nSo area around (1,4) to (5,5) is dense, but not fully blocked.\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,4) is free, (5,5) free, (6,3) free, (6,4) free, (6,5) has food, (3,6) obstacle, (4,6) food but disappearing, (5,6) free? Let's list possible cells.\n\nGrid: x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,6)\n\nSnake occupied: as above.\n\nFood: (4,6), (6,5), (1,6)\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nNow, from head (5,3), move options:\n\nOption 1: Right to (6,3)\n\nThen head at (6,3), direction Right.\n\n(6,3) is free, no food, so no eat, snake moves, tail at (3,5) as before? After moving to (6,3):\n\nNew head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)  // tail now at (3,5), since (4,5) dropped.\n\nLength 10, no growth.\n\nFrom (6,3), direction Right, can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, cannot, so only U or D.\n\n(6,4) is free, (6,2) free.\n\n(6,5) is above, so U to (6,4) then U to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nBut need to check if accessible.\n\nFrom (6,3), move U to (6,4), then from there U to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food, life span 6, so I can reach it in a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,4), I can go to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIf I eat at (6,5), the segment is added, so length increases.\n\nBut for now, let's see.\n\nOption 2: Up to (5,4)\n\nThen from (5,4), as before, can go U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is free? Let's check: not in snake positions, not wall, so yes.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) is food.\n\nOption 3: Down to (5,2)\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction Down.\n\nCan move L to (4,2), R to (6,2), or U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, cannot, or D to (5,1), but since direction Down, cannot go U (reverse).\n\nDirection Down, so cannot go Up.\n\nValid moves: L, R, or D.\n\n(4,2) free? x=4,y=2, not snake, not wall.\n\n(6,2) free.\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nBut going down might lead to less food access.\n\nSince (6,5) is close, I should go towards it.\n\n(1,6) is far, but I can go later.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 6 turns, so I have until turn 43 to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 38, I can reach (6,5) in 2 or 3 moves.\n\nFor example, from (5,3):\n\n- Turn 38: Right to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 39: Up to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 40: Up to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThat's 3 turns from now, turn 40.\n\nTurn 38 move to (6,3), turn 39 to (6,4), turn 40 to (6,5) eat.\n\nAt turn 40, life span of (6,5) is: at turn 38, L=6, turn 39 L=5, turn 40 L=4, so yes, can be eaten on turn 40.\n\nSimilarly, I could go Up first to (5,4), then Right to (6,4), then Up to (6,5), same number of moves.\n\nBut going Right directly might be better because I'm closer to x=6.\n\nFrom (5,3), Right to (6,3) in one move, then Up to (6,4), Up to (6,5).\n\nIf I go Up to (5,4), then Right to (6,4), then Up to (6,5), also three moves.\n\nBut with Right first, I end up at (6,3) which is lower, but same.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? When I eat at (6,5), where is the tail?\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so the body changes.\n\nBut first, let's consider immediate action.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block some paths.\n\nBut (3,6) is not near (6,5), so ok.\n\nNow, for (1,6), it's at top-left, while I'm at bottom-right, so it might take more turns to reach.\n\nBut life span 9, so I can go after eating (6,5).\n\nNow, but I need to think about survival; the snake is long, 10 cells, in a 8x8 grid with obstacles, so space might be tight.\n\nFree cells: total cells 64, walls: borders, but borders are walls, so cells from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable? No.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) blocked.\n\nAlso, y=6, x=3 is blocked, but other cells at y=6 are ok except borders.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6).\n\nSo total playable: 6x6=36 minus 1 for obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 10, so 25 free, but food occupies 3, but food is on free cells, so 22 free cells? Food is on cells that are not snake or wall, so when snake is not on food, it's separate.\n\nAt turn 38, cells: walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,6).\n\nFree cells: all other cells except snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: 10 cells.\n\nTotal cells: 64.\n\nWall cells: borders: top and bottom rows: y=0 and y=7, each has 8 cells, left and right columns x=0 and x=7, but corners shared, so 2*8 + 2*6 = 16 + 12 = 28? Better: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nNumber: for x=0: 8 cells (y=0 to7), x=7: 8 cells, y=0: x=1 to6, 6 cells, y=7: x=1 to6, 6 cells, but corners (0,0),(0,7),(7,0),(7,7) counted twice, so total wall cells: (8+8+6+6) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24? 8+8=16 for left/right, 6+6=12 for top/bottom without corners, but corners included in left/right, so 16 + 12 = 28, but no, when we say x=0, all y, includes corners, similarly y=0 all x includes corners, so when adding x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, we have double-counted the four corners.\n\nSo unique wall cells: (x=0 all y) + (x=7 all y) + (y=0 for x=1-6) + (y=7 for x=1-6) = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells.\n\nThen internal obstacle (3,6), so total wall/blocked cells: 29.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8=64.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 = 35.\n\nBut snake occupies 10, so empty cells: 35 - 10 = 25.\n\nFood on 3 cells, so truly free: 22 cells for movement.\n\nBut when snake moves, it frees tail cell, so space changes.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nI think going towards (6,5) is good.\n\nBut let's see if there is any risk.\n\nFirst, from (5,3), if I go Right to (6,3), that should be safe.\n\n(6,3) is free, as established.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go Up to (6,4), then to (6,5).\n\n(6,4) is free.\n\n(6,5) has food.\n\nWhen I move to (6,5) on turn, say, 40, I eat it, snake grows, so length becomes 11.\n\nThen tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to find next food or safe path.\n\n(1,6) is another food.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nI could go Up first to (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go to (6,4) then (6,5), or to (5,5) then (6,5), etc.\n\nBut going Right directly seems efficient.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,6) is disappearing, but I can't reach it, so no issue.\n\nBut is there a way to eat (4,6)? Only if I were adjacent, but I'm not, and can't be this turn.\n\nSo forget it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the future actions depend on what happens, like if I eat food, etc.\n\nThe output should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 38.\n\nBut since I don't know the future food spawns or anything, I think I need to plan based on current state, and assume no new food for now, but the problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only these foods are present until eaten or expired.\n\nState only gives current food, no mention of new food, so only these three, and one is expiring now.\n\nSo only two foods left after this turn.\n\nSo I should eat (6,5) first, then (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the body.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,5), but after moves, it changes.\n\nAfter eating (6,5), I need to go to (1,6).\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's plan the immediate actions to eat (6,5).\n\nShortest path: from (5,3) to (6,5): dx=1, dy=2, so min 2 moves, but not directly, since can't move diagonal.\n\nPossible in 2 moves? From (5,3) to (6,3) then to (6,4), but (6,4) not (6,5). (6,3) to (6,4) is up, then to (6,5) up again, so three moves: to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,4) then to (6,4) then to (6,5), same.\n\nOr to (5,4) then to (5,5) then to (6,5), etc., all three moves.\n\nMinimum two moves not possible because |dy| = 2, need two up moves, but from (5,3), I can only move one direction per turn.\n\nSo at least two moves to change y by 2, but since I need to go to x=6, which is one step, but with y change.\n\nIf I go to (6,3) first, y same, x+1, then to (6,4), y+1, then to (6,5), y+1.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nSo three turns to reach (6,5) from (5,3).\n\nTurn 38: move to (6,3)\n\nTurn 39: move to (6,4)  // assuming I go up\n\nTurn 40: move to (6,5) and eat.\n\nNow, on turn 40, after eating, head at (6,5), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nPositions: before move on turn 40, let's say turn 39 end: head at (6,4), body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 38: move to (6,3)\n\n- Turn 38 start: snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\n- Move R to (6,3)\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)  // (4,5) dropped, tail at (3,5)\n\nTurn 39: move to (6,4)\n\n- Head at (6,3), move U to (6,4)\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5), length 10\n\nTurn 40: move to (6,5)\n\n- Head at (6,4), move U to (6,5)\n\n- (6,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)  // and the new segment, so tail is still (2,5)? Since tail didn't move, the last segment before move is added.\n\nBefore move on turn 40, positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), ..., up to (3,5)? From above turn 39 end: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and (3,5) is tail? Positions: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5) — (3,5) is included? Turn 39 end: after move to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), segment1 (6,3), segment2 (5,3), segment3 (4,3), segment4 (4,4), segment5 (3,4), segment6 (2,4), segment7 (1,4), segment8 (1,5), segment9 (2,5) — where is (3,5)? Earlier I had (3,5) as tail, but in the sequence, after dropping (4,5), and moving, segment9 is (2,5), which was previous segment8? Let's list carefully.\n\nInitial turn 38: positions: 0:(5,3), 1:(4,3), 2:(4,4), 3:(3,4), 4:(2,4), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(3,5), 9:(4,5)\n\nAfter move R to (6,3):\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n\n- Then body: 0 becomes (5,3), 1 becomes (4,3), 2 becomes (4,4), 3 becomes (3,4), 4 becomes (2,4), 5 becomes (1,4), 6 becomes (1,5), 7 becomes (2,5), 8 becomes (3,5)  // and 9:(4,5) dropped, so new positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]  // 10 segments, tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)  // and (3,5) becomes body, but since tail moves, (3,5) is dropped? When moving, the head moves to new position, each segment takes previous position of the one before.\n\nAfter move to (6,4):\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Segment1: (6,3)  // previous head\n\n- Segment2: (5,3)  // previous segment1\n\n- Segment3: (4,3)  // previous segment2\n\n- Segment4: (4,4)  // previous segment3\n\n- Segment5: (3,4)  // previous segment4\n\n- Segment6: (2,4)  // previous segment5\n\n- Segment7: (1,4)  // previous segment6\n\n- Segment8: (1,5)  // previous segment7\n\n- Segment9: (2,5)  // previous segment8\n\nPrevious segment9 was (3,5), but it is dropped, so tail is at (2,5)\n\nPositions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]  // tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 40: move U to (6,5)\n\n- (6,5) has food, so eat it.\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Since food eaten, tail does not move, so the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the tail position before move? Standard snake: when food eaten, the tail stays, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: new head (6,5), then the previous body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and the tail (2,5) is duplicated or something? No.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), ..., up to tail (2,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5) and eating, the new head is (6,5), then the first body segment is the old head (6,4), then old segment1 (6,3), and so on, up to old segment9 (2,5), and since food eaten, no segment is removed, so the tail is still (2,5), but it's the last segment.\n\nThe snake has 11 segments now: positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\nHead at (6,5), direction Up.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to (1,6) to eat the other food.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nCurrent head at (6,5), so I need to move left and up.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,6), and snake body in the way.\n\nPossible path: I can go left to (5,5), but (5,5) is free? Let's see free cells.\n\nFree cells around: (5,5), (6,6), (7,5) wall, etc.\n\n(5,5) is free, I think.\n\nFrom (6,5), direction Up, so can move U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,4) but (6,4) is body now, cannot move there.\n\nSo valid moves: U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\n(6,6) is y=6, not wall, x=6 not wall, and not snake, so free.\n\nSimilarly (5,5) free.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so I need to go left.\n\nBut directly, I can go to (5,5), then to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter the moves, the body has changed.\n\nIn the positions above, (4,5) is not occupied; earlier it was dropped.\n\nLet's list current free cells after eating at turn 40.\n\nBut for planning, I should consider turn 38 action first.\n\nFor turn 38, I think going Right to (6,3) is good.\n\nBut let's see if going Up or Down has advantages.\n\nDown to (5,2): then head at (5,2), which is closer to bottom, but (6,5) is up, so I would need to go up later, might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can go to (5,3) but occupied, or to (6,2), then (6,3), etc., longer to (6,5).\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nUp to (5,4): then I can go to (6,4) or (5,5), both good for approaching (6,5).\n\nBut with Right, I directly go to x=6, which is good.\n\nNow, another food at (1,6), which has life span 9, so after turn 38, it can be eaten until turn 46.\n\nTurn 38 + 9 -1 = 46? t=38, L=9, eaten from 38 to 46 inclusive, 9 turns.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) on turn 40, I have until turn 46 to eat (1,6), which is 6 turns, should be enough.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (1,6): dx=5, dy=1, so min 6 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: need to go left through y=5 or y=6, but y=6 has obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo possible to go to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), but (3,5) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 40, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), tail (2,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,5), (5,4) is body, (5,4) is segment? Positions: (6,5) head, (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nSo (5,4) is not occupied; it was free earlier, now still free? (5,4) is not in the list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (4,5) free, (3,5) free? (3,5) is not in positions, yes.\n\n(3,6) obstacle.\n\n(1,6) food.\n\n(2,6) free? Not occupied.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I can go from (6,5) to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (3,5), but from (3,5) to (2,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so to (2,5) but (2,5) is tail, but when I move, tail might move.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nFor turn 38, I think moving Right to (6,3) is a good start to reach (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, I could move Up, but Right seems direct.\n\nBut let's check if moving Right is safe.\n\n(6,3) is free, no wall, no body.\n\nThen from there, moving Up to (6,4) should be safe.\n\nThen to (6,5) to eat.\n\nAfter that, from (6,5), I can go Left to (5,5) or Up to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is top-right, might be a corner.\n\n(5,5) is towards center.\n\nThen to reach (1,6), I can go to (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) is blocked, so I need to go below or above.\n\ny=6 is available except (3,6), so (1,6), (2,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) are free except food and obstacles.\n\n(4,6) food disappeared, so not there.\n\n(1,6) food, (2,6) free, (4,6) gone, (5,6) free, (6,6) free.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can go to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, or to (3,4) body, or to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut when I go to (3,5), if free, I can, then to (2,6) or something.\n\nI need to simulate later.\n\nFor now, turn 38 action: I think R is good.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going to (6,5) quickly is best.\n\nIf I go Up first to (5,4), then I might have more options, but it takes same time to (6,5).\n\nFor example, from (5,4) I can go to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\nBut (5,5) is closer to (1,6)? Not really.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), from (5,3) or (6,5), similar distance.\n\nBut let's decide turn 38.\n\nI think R is fine.\n\nThen turn 39: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: U to (6,5) eat.\n\nThen for turn 41, from (6,5), I need to go to (1,6).\n\nBut to output, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn 38, 39, 40, etc., but I don't know how many.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output a sequence of 5 actions or more.\n\nBut let's see the current turn is 38, so actions for 38,39,40,41,42.\n\nBut after turn 40, I eat food, so state changes.\n\nI can plan the first few actions.\n\nPerhaps for now, output up to eating the food.\n\nBut (1,6) is far, so I need to go there.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (6,5), I can go directly to (1,6) via a path.\n\nShortest path: from (6,5) to (1,6): dx=-5, dy=1.\n\nI can go left along y=5 or y=6.\n\ny=5: from (6,5) to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), but (2,5) is tail, and it might move.\n\nIn the positions after turn 40, (2,5) is tail.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), then to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied by tail, but I can move to tail cell if the tail moves away, but when I move to it, if it's tail, and I eat or not.\n\n(2,5) is not food, so if I move to (2,5) when it is tail, and I don't eat, then head moves to (2,5), tail moves away, so it's ok, no collision.\n\nIf food on tail, but no food at (2,5).\n\nSo I can move to (2,5) if it is tail.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 40, tail is at (2,5), and if I move to (2,5) on some turn, it might be possible.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (1,6):\n\nOne way: go to (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so to (2,6), then to (1,6).\n\n(2,6) to (1,6) is left.\n\nOr from (3,5) to (2,5) but (2,5) is tail.\n\nOn turn 41, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\nSay I go L to (5,5).\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction Left.\n\nNo food, so move, tail moves: old tail (2,5) moves to where? When I move to (5,5), new head (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), and tail (2,5) dropped? Let's not detail.\n\nPoint is, I can go to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to save time, for turn 38, I'll go with R.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the output should start from turn 38.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there is negative food, but here all food positive.\n\nAnother thing: in the food list, all have value 1, so no penalty.\n\nSo for turn 38: R\n\nThen turn 39: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: U to (6,5) eat\n\nThen for turn 41, from (6,5), I can go L to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 42: from (5,5), direction Left, can go L to (4,5), D to (5,4) but (5,4) might be body, U to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is body, as in positions.\n\nAfter turn 40, positions include (6,4), (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom (5,5), valid moves: since direction Left, cannot go R.\n\nCan go U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, L to (4,5), or R but invalid.\n\n(4,5) is free, as before.\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nSo can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nTo go to (1,6), going L to (4,5) is better.\n\nThen to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to turn 40 or 41.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and turn 38, so up to turn 43 or so.\n\nBut let's define the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 38: move Right to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 39: move Up to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: move Up to (6,5) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 41: from (6,5), move Left to (5,5)\n\nTurn 42: from (5,5), move Left to (4,5)  // assuming direction Left\n\nThen turn 43: from (4,5), can move Left to (3,5) or Down to (4,4) but (4,4) body, or Up to (4,6) but (4,6) food gone, and y=6, but (4,6) disappeared, so free cell? But no food.\n\n(3,5) is free, so move to (3,5)\n\nThen to (2,6) or something.\n\nBut I need to reach (1,6).\n\n(1,6) life span until turn 46, so on turn 43, L for (1,6) at turn 38 L=9, turn 39 L=8, ..., turn 43 L=4, so still available.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (2,5) but (2,5) may be body or not, or to (3,6) obstacle, or to (2,6), or to (4,5) body.\n\nValid from (3,5): suppose direction to (3,5) is Left or something.\n\nBut it's getting messy.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, output the first few actions to eat the food.\n\nBut I think moving Right on turn 38 is reasonable.\n\nAnother option: if I move Up on turn 38 to (5,4), then turn 39 Right to (6,4), turn 40 Up to (6,5) eat, same as before.\n\nBut with Right first, I start moving right immediately.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the internal obstacle.\n\nBut I think R is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 38 and Beyond\n\n**Current State Summary (Turn 38):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, excluding walls and obstacles).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (5,3), body segments: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)], tail at (4,5). Length = 10.\n  - Current direction: Right (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn if not eaten).\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten from turn 38 to 43).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 9 (can be eaten from turn 38 to 46).\n- **Key Constraints**:\n  - Cannot move left (opposite of current direction Right).\n  - (4,6) cannot be eaten this turn: not adjacent to head, and moving left is invalid/unsafe.\n  - Tail reward danger not applicable (head not adjacent to tail).\n\n**Strategy (Think 5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Immediate Priority (Turn 38)**: Maximize score while ensuring survival. (4,6) is unreachable and expires, so ignore. Target (6,5) for +1 score and growth, as it is closer (reachable in 2-3 turns) with moderate life span (6 turns). (1,6) has longer life span (9 turns) but is farther; eat after (6,5).\n- **Path to (6,5)**:\n  - From (5,3), move right to (6,3) on turn 38 (safe, no collision).\n  - Then move up to (6,4) on turn 39.\n  - Then move up to (6,5) on turn 40 to eat (life span allows).\n- **After Eating (6,5)**: Snake length increases to 11. Head at (6,5), direction Up. Target (1,6) next, with path: move left to (5,5) on turn 41, then continue left/down as needed. Avoid (3,6) obstacle.\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - No collision: Path to (6,5) avoids body and walls.\n  - Tail reward danger: Not triggered during eating (6,5) (tail not adjacent).\n  - Long-term survival: After eating (6,5), head is near open areas. Path to (1,6) uses free cells (e.g., (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,6), (1,6)) and leverages tail movement to avoid traps.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: Focus on reaching and eating (6,5) by turn 40, then initiate path to (1,6). Actions for turns 38-42 are committed; beyond depends on state.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 38-42):**\n- **Turn 38**: Move Right (R) to (6,3).  \n  - Why: Moves toward (6,5), valid (no reverse), safe (cell free). Avoids down (away from food) and up (less direct).\n- **Turn 39**: Move Up (U) to (6,4).  \n  - Why: Continues path to (6,5), valid (direction now Right, but Up is allowed), safe (cell free).\n- **Turn 40**: Move Up (U) to (6,5) and eat food.  \n  - Why: Eats (6,5) for +1 score and growth. Valid (direction Up), safe (no body/wall). Life span (4 at turn 40) allows.\n- **Turn 41**: Move Left (L) to (5,5).  \n  - Why: After eating, head at (6,5) direction Up. Move left toward (1,6), valid (no reverse), safe (cell free).\n- **Turn 42**: Move Left (L) to (4,5).  \n  - Why: Continues path to (1,6), valid (direction Left), safe (cell free). Avoids up/down into body or walls.\n\n**Beyond Turn 42**:  \n- Target (1,6) via (3,5) or (2,6), avoiding (3,6). Life span allows (e.g., reach by turn 46). Monitor for risks like tail adjacency when nearing food.\n\nThis plan prioritizes immediate food access with minimal risk, ensuring long-term survival and score maximization.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 39: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 40: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 41: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 42: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 39.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,3), then body segments at (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to get to (6,3).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 8 and value 1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating them gives +1 score and increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake: head at (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So let's list coordinates:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (3,5)\n\n- Tail: (3,5) is the last? Positions are given as a list: index 0 is head, index 9 is tail. So tail is at (3,5).\n\nNow, food at (6,5) and (1,6).\n\nHead direction is R, so it came from left, meaning it was at (5,3) before moving to (6,3) on this turn.\n\nSince head direction is given as R, and positions show head at (6,3), previous head was at (5,3), and it moved right to (6,3).\n\nNow, for movement, I can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse. Since head direction is R, I cannot move left (L) on the next turn because that would be opposite direction.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- Up: U to (6,4)\n\n- Down: D to (6,2)\n\n- Right: R to (7,3) but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move right.\n\nx=7 is a border wall, so moving right to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision.\n\n- Left: L to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by the body segment, but let's see collision rules.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves, so it's safe to move to the tail's current position only if the tail will move away.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body cell is deadly except for the tail cell, which is safe because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (5,3) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,3) would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is head, moving left to (5,3) which is occupied by segment, so collision.\n\nTherefore, from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4): what is at (6,4)? Not in snake positions, and not a wall? Walls are borders and (3,6), so (6,4) should be empty.\n\n- D to (6,2): similarly, should be empty.\n\n- R to (7,3): wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (5,3): body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves are U or D.\n\nI need to choose between up or down.\n\nBut I have to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,5) and (1,6).\n\n(6,5) is above, at y=5, x=6. Head is at (6,3), so (6,5) is two cells up.\n\n(1,6) is far away, at x=1,y=6.\n\nLife span: food at (6,5) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is t=39, so at turn 39, life span is 6, so it will disappear after turn 39 + 5? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo if life span is L at turn T, it disappears at turn T + L - 1? Or at the end of turn T + L?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn, including current, then at turn T, with life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and when life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (6,5), life span 6 at turn 39:\n\n- After turn 39, life span becomes 5\n\n- After turn 40, becomes 4\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 44, becomes 0, so it disappears after turn 44? Or at the start of turn 45?\n\nI need to clarify.\n\nUsually in such games, the food is present for N turns, meaning from turn T to T + N - 1, and disappears at turn T + N.\n\nBut let's read: \"disappears after N turns\" – ambiguous.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn T, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 after the turn.\n\nThen at turn T + L - 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears after that turn.\n\nFor example, if life span 1 at turn T, it is present at turn T, decreases to 0 after turn T, and disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn T.\n\nSimilarly, life span 6 at turn 39:\n\n- Turn 39: life span 6\n\n- After turn 39, life span 5\n\n- Turn 40: life span 5\n\n- After turn 40, life span 4\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 44: life span 1\n\n- After turn 44, life span 0, disappears, so not present on turn 45.\n\nSo food at (6,5) can be eaten from turn 39 to 44 inclusive? On turn 44, life span is 1, so it can be eaten, and after that it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6) life span 8 at turn 39:\n\n- Present until turn 39 + 7 = 46? Turn 39: life 8, after turn 39:7, turn 40:7, ..., after turn 46: life 0? Let's calculate.\n\nStart: turn 39, life 8\n\nAfter turn 39: life 7\n\nAfter turn 40: life 6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 45: life 1? Turn t, after turn t, life decreases.\n\nAfter turn t, life = initial life - (t - t_initial + 1)? Better to think indices.\n\nAt turn 39, life span L=6 for (6,5). After each turn, life decreases by 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- During turn 39: L=6\n\n- After turn 39, L=5\n\n- During turn 40: L=5\n\n- After turn 40, L=4\n\n- During turn 41: L=4\n\n- After turn 41, L=3\n\n- During turn 42: L=3\n\n- After turn 42, L=2\n\n- During turn 43: L=2\n\n- After turn 43, L=1\n\n- During turn 44: L=1\n\n- After turn 44, L=0, disappears, so not available on turn 45.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6), L=8 at turn 39:\n\n- During turn 39: L=8\n\n- After turn 39, L=7\n\n- ...\n\n- During turn 46: L=1\n\n- After turn 46, L=0, disappears.\n\nSo (1,6) available until turn 46.\n\nNow back to movement.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can only move U or D.\n\nMove U to (6,4): then what?\n\nOr D to (6,2).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the snake body and future positions.\n\nFirst, let's think about the food at (6,5). It's close, at (6,5), which is two cells up from head at (6,3).\n\nIf I move up to (6,4) on turn 39, then I can move up again to (6,5) on turn 40 to eat the food.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so length increases.\n\nAlso, special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here tail is at (3,5), not near head.\n\nHead at (6,3), tail at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,3) and (3,5) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, if I move up to (6,4) on turn 39.\n\nThen on turn 40, I can move up to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nWhat are the positions?\n\nCurrent snake positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nAfter move U to (6,4) on turn 39: head moves to (6,4), and each body segment moves to the previous position, so:\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,3) [was head], (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail was (3,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves away from (3,5) to (2,5)? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo positions after move U on turn 39:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Then segments: (6,3) [previous head], (5,3) [previous seg1], (4,3) [prev seg2], (4,4) [prev seg3], (3,4) [prev seg4], (2,4) [prev seg5], (1,4) [prev seg6], (1,5) [prev seg7], (2,5) [prev seg8] — prev seg9 was (3,5), but since tail moves, (3,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nThe snake has 10 segments, after moving without eating, it has 9 segments? No.\n\nSnake length remains the same when no food eaten, so when moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: new head at (6,4), then the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSo previous positions: index 0: (6,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (3,5)\n\nAfter move, head to (6,4), so new positions:\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- Then: (6,3) [prev head], (5,3) [prev1], (4,3) [prev2], (4,4) [prev3], (3,4) [prev4], (2,4) [prev5], (1,4) [prev6], (1,5) [prev7], (2,5) [prev8] — and prev9 (3,5) is no longer occupied, since tail moved.\n\nThe body segments are the previous positions from 0 to 8, but shifted: the new body is prev0, prev1, ..., prev8, but prev0 is now at the position of prev0, which is (6,3), and so on.\n\nStandard: after moving, the new body consists of the previous head position followed by all but the last body segment.\n\nEasier: the snake positions become: [new_head] + positions[:-1] but positions[:-1] are all body segments except tail.\n\nPositions list: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg9] where seg9 is tail.\n\nAfter moving to new_head, the new positions are [new_head] + [positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[8]] but positions[0] is old head, which is now the first body segment.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, old_seg2, ..., old_seg8] and old_seg9 (tail) is removed.\n\nIn this case, old_head is (6,3), old_seg1 is (5,3), ..., old_seg8 is (2,5), old_seg9 is (3,5) removed.\n\nSo after move U to (6,4) on turn 39:\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- New body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail was (3,5), removed.\n\nNow, on turn 40, I can move to (6,5) to eat the food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is food, so if I move to (6,5), I eat it, and snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, when head moves to food, the tail does not move, so length increases.\n\nSo on turn 40, move U to (6,5): head to (6,5), which has food, so snake grows: new head at (6,5), and positions become [ (6,5) ] + previous positions, so previous positions were [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] — after turn 39 move, positions are [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]? No.\n\nAfter turn 39 move to (6,4): positions are [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] — that's 10 positions? But we had 10 segments, moved without eating, so should be 9? Mistake.\n\nInitial positions: 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving without eating: head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so 9 segments.\n\nIn positions list: from 10 elements to 9.\n\nInitial: indices 0 to 9, 10 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head at new position, then the first 9 old positions become the body, but the old positions are old head to old tail, but when shifting, the new body is old head and all old body except the last one? I think I confused.\n\nStandard way: let S be the list of positions before move.\n\nS = [P0, P1, P2, ..., P9] where P0 is head, P9 is tail.\n\nAfter moving to new head position H:\n\n- If no food eaten, new positions: [H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8] — so P9 is removed, and we have 9 segments.\n\n- If food eaten, new positions: [H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P9] — tail not removed, 11 segments.\n\nIn this case, after turn 39 move U to (6,4), no food eaten, so new positions: head (6,4), then old head (6,3), then old seg1 (5,3), old seg2 (4,3), old seg3 (4,4), old seg4 (3,4), old seg5 (2,4), old seg6 (1,4), old seg7 (1,5), and old seg8 (2,5) — old seg8 was (2,5), which was index 8 in initial, but initial had indices 0 to 9, P8 is (2,5), P9 is (3,5).\n\nAfter move: [H, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8] so positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — that's 10 positions? But P8 is included, P9 is removed.\n\nP8 is (2,5), which was the second last, so in new positions, it's the new tail.\n\nNumber of segments: from 10 to 9, so only 9 positions.\n\nList: new head H = (6,4)\n\nThen P0 = (6,3)\n\nP1 = (5,3)\n\nP2 = (4,3)\n\nP3 = (4,4)\n\nP4 = (3,4)\n\nP5 = (2,4)\n\nP6 = (1,4)\n\nP7 = (1,5)\n\nP8 = (2,5)  -- and P9 = (3,5) not included.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]? That's 10 positions, but P8 is included, which is fine, but it should be 9 segments because tail removed.\n\nPositions list has 10 elements? No: S before move has 10 elements.\n\nAfter move: [H] + [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8] so 9 elements? [H] and then 9 from P0 to P8, but P0 to P8 is 9 positions, so total 10 positions? H plus 9 body segments, total 10.\n\nBut when no food eaten, the number of segments should decrease by one? No, the snake length is constant when no food, so number of segments same, but the tail moves, so the cell is vacated.\n\nNumber of segments remains the same only when food is eaten; otherwise, it decreases? No.\n\nSnake mechanics: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves from its cell, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but the tail cell is freed.\n\nIn terms of positions list, the list has the same length before and after move if no food? No.\n\nBefore move: N segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new position, tail is removed, so the new positions list has N-1 segments? No.\n\nFor example, if snake has 1 segment, after moving to new cell without eating, it would have 1 segment, but it moved, so positions change.\n\nStandard: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats food.\n\nWhen it eats food, length increases by one.\n\nWhen it doesn't eat, length remains the same, and it moves by adding a new head and removing the tail.\n\nSo for a snake of length L, positions list has L elements.\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating: new head position added, tail position removed, so still L elements.\n\nAfter moving with eating: new head position added, tail not removed, so L+1 elements.\n\nIn this case, initial snake has 10 segments, so L=10.\n\nAfter move without eating on turn 39: new head at (6,4), and the positions become: new head, then the old head, then old body segments except the old tail is not included, so the first L-1 old positions are kept.\n\nOld positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P9\n\nAfter move: new head H, then P0, P1, P2, ..., P8\n\nP0 to P8 are 9 positions, plus H, so 10 positions, but P9 is omitted, so the new tail is P8.\n\nSo for L=10, after move without eating, still 10 segments? No: old list has P0 to P9, 10 positions.\n\nNew list: H, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8 — that's 10 positions: H and P0 to P8.\n\nP0 to P8 is 9 positions, H is one, total 10.\n\nBut P9 is removed, so the cell P9 is free now.\n\nThe number of segments is the same, 10.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nFor example, simple case: snake at [(1,1)], length 1. Move to (1,2) without eating: new positions [(1,2)], still length 1.\n\nMove to (1,2) with eating: new positions [(1,2), (1,1)], length 2.\n\nAnother case: snake at [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1)] length 3. Move to (2,3) without eating: new positions [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1)] — tail (1,1) removed.\n\nSo positions: new head, then all old positions except the last one (tail) is removed.\n\nOld positions: [P0, P1, P2] with P2 tail.\n\nAfter move: [H, P0, P1] — P2 removed.\n\nSo length same.\n\nIn our case, initial positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) ] so P0=(6,3), P1=(5,3), P2=(4,3), P3=(4,4), P4=(3,4), P5=(2,4), P6=(1,4), P7=(1,5), P8=(2,5), P9=(3,5)\n\nAfter move U to (6,4) without eating: new head H=(6,4), then P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8 so positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] and P9=(3,5) removed.\n\nSo new tail is (2,5).\n\nOn turn 40, if I move U to (6,5), which has food, so I eat it.\n\nHead moves to (6,5), which is food, so new positions: new head H=(6,5), then all old positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] so new positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] — length 11 now.\n\nAnd food at (6,5) is eaten.\n\nBut (6,5) was food, so it's gone now.\n\nLife span was 6 at turn 39, so on turn 40 it can be eaten, life span during turn 40 is 5, but it gets eaten.\n\nNow, is this safe? When moving to (6,5) on turn 40, what is at (6,5)? Before moving, the cell (6,5) is empty, no body, not wall, so it should be safe to move there and eat.\n\nBut after eating, the snake has new tail at (2,5), which is not near head.\n\nHead at (6,5), tail at (2,5), far.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nIf I move down instead on turn 39.\n\nFrom (6,3), move D to (6,2).\n\nThen positions: new head (6,2), then old head (6,3), then P1 (5,3), P2 (4,3), P3 (4,4), P4 (3,4), P5 (2,4), P6 (1,4), P7 (1,5), P8 (2,5) — P9 (3,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen I can move to, say, (6,1) or (5,2) or (7,2) but x=7 wall, or (6,2) down to (6,1), but y=0 wall? y=0 is wall, so (6,1) is not wall, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nSo (6,1): x=6 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Similarly, (5,2) etc.\n\nBut if I move down to (6,2), then I am away from the food at (6,5).\n\nAnd food at (6,5) has limited life, only until turn 44, so if I don't eat it soon, I might miss it.\n\nBut there is another food at (1,6), which is available longer, until turn 46.\n\nBut (1,6) is at the top left, while head is at bottom right.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), which might block paths.\n\nNow, back to the choice: on turn 39, move U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4) on t39, then on t40 move U to (6,5) to eat food, score +1, length 11.\n\nThen I need to decide where to go from there.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5) on t40, positions: head at (6,5), body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut R to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5): is it free? Not in positions, not wall, so should be free.\n\nD to (6,4): but (6,4) is body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, so (6,6) should be free? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (6,6) is not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) not wall.\n\nNow, head at (6,5), after eating, so positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), or L to (5,5), or D to (6,4) but (6,4) is occupied by body, so collision, invalid.\n\nR to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I move U to (6,6) on t41, then positions: new head (6,6), then old head (6,5), then old body except tail removed? No, no food, so move without eating.\n\nAfter move U to (6,6): new head (6,6), then old positions except tail: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — tail was (2,5), removed.\n\nOld positions before move: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] 11 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no food: new head (6,6), then [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — (2,5) removed, so new tail (1,5).\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move U, but y=7 wall, so (6,7) invalid.\n\nD to (6,5), but (6,5) is now body segment, collision.\n\nL to (5,6), or R to (7,6) wall invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen continue, but I might be cornered.\n\nIf from (6,5) on t40 after eating, I move L to (5,5) instead.\n\n(5,5) is free? Assume yes.\n\nThen move L to (5,5), no food there, so new positions: head (5,5), then old head (6,5), then old body except tail: [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]? Old positions before move: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no food: new head (5,5), then [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — (2,5) removed, new tail (1,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo possible U, D, L.\n\nBut I need to consider the other food at (1,6) and the internal obstacle.\n\nPerhaps moving up to eat the food is good, but after that, the snake is in the top right, and the other food is at (1,6), which is top left, but there is an obstacle at (3,6), so I need to go around.\n\nMoreover, the snake body might block paths.\n\nLet's think about the grid and the snake shape.\n\nInitial grid: walls at borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom and left, with a loop.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,4) to (3,4), so it's like a turn.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top left, near the body.\n\nBody has (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(1,6) is above (1,5), but (1,5) is a body segment.\n\nFood at (1,6) can be eaten if head moves there, but it might be risky if the body is near.\n\nLife span is long, so I can take time.\n\nBut for long-term, I should aim to eat both foods if possible.\n\nBut first, on turn 39, I have to choose U or D.\n\nIf I move down to (6,2), then I can go to the bottom, but there might be less space.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), I can move to (6,1), or (5,2), or (6,3) but body, or (7,2) wall.\n\n(6,3) is body, so only (6,1) or (5,2).\n\n(6,1) is close to wall y=0, and (5,2) is free.\n\nBut then I am moving away from both foods.\n\nFood at (6,5) will disappear soon, so if I go down, I might not be able to eat it.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), to eat (6,5), I need to go up, but after moving down, on turn 40, from (6,2), I can move U to (6,3), but (6,3) is body? After move to (6,2) on t39, positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), etc., so (6,3) is the first body segment, so moving to (6,3) would be collision.\n\nSo from (6,2), I cannot move up to (6,3) because it's occupied.\n\nI can move to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nIf to (5,2), then from there, I can move to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, or (4,2), or (5,1), or (6,2) body.\n\nSo only (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nThis seems to be leading away, and I might not reach (6,5) in time.\n\nDistance: from (6,2) to (6,5) is 3 cells up, but I can't go directly because body is in the way.\n\nThe body is at (6,3), (5,3), etc., so to go up, I need to go around, but time is short.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), move to (5,2) on t39.\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) — tail (2,5) removed? After t39 move to (6,2): positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5).\n\nThen move to (5,2) on t40: new head (5,2), then old positions except tail: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — (2,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision, or (4,2), or (5,1), or (6,2) body.\n\nSo only (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nSay move to (4,2), then to (4,3) body, or (3,2), etc. I'm going left and down, away from (6,5).\n\nTo reach (6,5) from here, I need to go up, but the body is blocking the direct path.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can go to (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3) body, etc.\n\nIt might take many turns to reach (6,5), and by turn 44, only 5 turns left from turn 39.\n\nTurn 39 to 44: t39,40,41,42,43,44: 6 turns including 39, but on t44 it can be eaten.\n\nFrom t39, if I move down, on t39 I am at (6,2), then to go to (6,5), I need to go up, but (6,3) is occupied until the body moves.\n\nThe body will move as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, on t40, if I am at (5,2), positions have (6,3) which is body.\n\nOn t41, if I move, say, to (4,2), then positions shift, (6,3) might still be there or not.\n\nIt's messy, and the food might expire before I can reach it.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat the close food at (6,5) now.\n\nSo on turn 39, move U to (6,4).\n\nThen on turn 40, move U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 40, after eating, head at (6,5), positions as above.\n\nThen on turn 41, I need to move from (6,5).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), then from there, only L to (5,6), since U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) body, R wall.\n\nThen on t42, from (5,6), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (5,7) y=7 wall invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6) body.\n\n(6,6) is body? After t41 move to (6,6), positions: let's trace.\n\nAfter t40 eat at (6,5): positions [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\nOn t41, move U to (6,6): no food, so new head (6,6), then [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — (2,5) removed, tail at (1,5).\n\nPositions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]? From above: new head (6,6), then old head (6,5), then old body except tail: old body was (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (1,5), (2,5) but (2,5) removed, so [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ]\n\nYes.\n\nNow (1,5) is tail.\n\nFrom (6,6), on t41, after move, head at (6,6).\n\nThen on t42, move from (6,6): possible moves: U invalid (y=7), D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision, L to (5,6), R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nMove to (5,6): no food, so new head (5,6), then [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] — tail (1,5) removed? Old tail was (1,5), removed, so new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]? Old body except tail: after t41, positions were [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] but (1,5) is tail, removed, so new body is [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] 10 segments.\n\nNew head (5,6), so positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nNow from (5,6), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (5,7) wall invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6) body.\n\nSo possible D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\n(5,5) might be free, or (4,6).\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is not obstacle.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, so (4,6) is free.\n\nIf I move to (4,6), then I can go towards the left to reach (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is food, and I need to eat it.\n\nAlso, the body is at (1,4), (2,4), etc.\n\nNow, if from (6,5) on t41, I had moved L to (5,5) instead of U.\n\nThen on t41, move L to (5,5): no food, so new head (5,5), then old positions except tail: from t40 positions [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] after move to (5,5) no food: new head (5,5), then [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] — (2,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nTail at (1,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5) body.\n\nSo U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5).\n\nNow, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near (1,5), the tail.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to move to (1,6) when it's free.\n\nBut (1,6) might be under the body or not.\n\nCurrently, body has (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is not occupied, it's food.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to (1,6).\n\nBut if the tail is at (1,5), and head moves to (1,6), it should be fine, as long as not colliding.\n\nBut there is a risk if the head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here the food is at (1,6), not on tail.\n\nTail is at (1,5), no food on it.\n\nFood is at (1,6), separate.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I can plan a path.\n\nFor example, from current position after eating (6,5), I can head towards (1,6).\n\nBut with the body, it might be tight.\n\nSince I have to plan multiple turns, let's list actions for t39 to t39+5 or so.\n\nBut I need to output actions starting from t39.\n\nFirst, on t39, I think move U to (6,4) is best to go for the food.\n\nThen on t40, move U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen on t41, I need to choose.\n\nTo avoid being cornered, moving L to (5,5) might be better, so I have more space.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move towards (1,6).\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), and life span until t46, so I have time.\n\nCurrent turn t39, t46 is 7 turns away, so I can reach it.\n\nBut the snake is long, 11 after eating, so I need to navigate.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) might block.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so I cannot go to (3,6).\n\nNow, to go from (5,5) to (1,6), I can go left then up, or up then left.\n\nBut the area around (2,5), (3,5), etc. might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating at t40, positions have (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nLet's list the free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can decide the first few moves.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output in the format with actions.\n\nBut I need to start from t39.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,6), it might be under the body or can be eaten.\n\nCurrent positions: snake has (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is above (1,5), and (1,6) is free, not body.\n\nFood at (1,6) can be eaten by moving to it.\n\nBut the head is at (6,5), far.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5) on t41, then on t42, I can move L to (4,5), for example.\n\nThen to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter t41 at (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\n(3,5) is not occupied, it was tail earlier but removed.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) removed, so (3,5) is free.\n\nSo I can move to (4,5) on t42, then to (3,5) on t43, then to (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(3,6) is internal obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can move to (2,5), (3,4), (4,5) body, or (3,6) wall.\n\n(2,5) is free? After t42, let's not trace all.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (4,6) or (3,5) or (4,4) body, etc.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I need to go to (2,6) or (1,5), but (1,5) is body.\n\n(1,5) is body segment, so I cannot move to it unless it's tail.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) is not tail, it's a body segment.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I need the head to move to (1,6) when it is free, which it is, but I must approach from adjacent cell.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied, so I can only move to (1,6) from (1,7) or (0,6) or (2,6) or (1,5), but (1,5) occupied, (0,6) x=0 wall, (1,7) y=7 wall, so only from (2,6) or if (1,5) is tail and I move to it.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I must have the head at (2,6) or (1,7) or (0,6), but (1,7) and (0,6) walls, so only possible from (2,6).\n\nI must move to (1,6) from (2,6).\n\nBecause (1,5) is occupied by body, and may not be free when I want to move.\n\nSimilarly, other directions are walls.\n\nSo the only way to eat (1,6) is to have the head at (2,6) and move left to (1,6).\n\nNow, (2,6) is currently free, I think.\n\nBut the body might move there or not.\n\nSince the food has life span, I can plan to be at (2,6) before turn 46.\n\nBut with the snake moving, it's flexible.\n\nFor now, on turn 39, I should move U to (6,4).\n\nThen on turn 40, move U to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 41, to have options, move L to (5,5).\n\nThen from there, I can start moving left and up towards (1,6).\n\nFor example, on t42, move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far, as the state may change.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I can do for a few turns.\n\nBut the format is to output for multiple turns starting from t39.\n\nPerhaps I can output for t39 to t43 or something.\n\nBut let's see the food life.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, special case: food can spawn under body, but here (1,6) is not under body, it's free.\n\n(1,6) is not occupied by snake, so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for (6,5).\n\nSo for t39: move U\n\nt40: move U to eat\n\nt41: move L to (5,5)\n\nThen t42: for example, move U to (5,6) to go up.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut to be safe, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, moving down on t39 might lead to a safer area, but I might miss the food.\n\nI think eating the food is better for score and to grow, but I need to survive.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), the snake is along the top and right, and the left part is free, so I can manuever to the left.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move to (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5), but (2,5) might be free.\n\nAfter t41 at (5,5), positions have (1,5) and (1,4), so (2,5) is free, I think.\n\nIn positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] so (2,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(3,5) free, etc.\n\nSo I can move to (4,5) on t42.\n\nThen to (3,5) on t43.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, or (2,5), or (3,6) wall, or (4,5) body.\n\nSo only to (2,5).\n\nThen to (2,6) or (1,5) body, or (2,4) body, or (3,5) body.\n\n(2,4) and (1,5) are body, so from (2,5), I can move to (2,6) if free.\n\nThen from (2,6) to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut (1,6) is food, so eating it.\n\nBut I need to check if when I move to (1,6), the tail is not adjacent or something, but tail reward danger only if food is on tail and head adjacent, not here.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nLet's estimate turns.\n\nt39: move U to (6,4)\n\nt40: move U to (6,5) eat\n\nt41: move L to (5,5)\n\nt42: move L to (4,5)  -- assuming I move left\n\nt43: move D or L? From (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), or D to (4,4), or U to (4,6), etc.\n\nTo go to (2,6), better to go to (3,5) first.\n\nMove to (3,5) on t43.\n\nt44: move to (2,5) on t44? From (3,5) to (2,5)\n\nThen t45: move to (2,6) on t45\n\nt46: move to (1,6) on t46 to eat, but food at (1,6) disappears after turn 46, so on turn 46, during turn, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) on t46, I can eat it.\n\nBut is (2,6) free? Currently yes, but need to ensure no body moves there.\n\nWith the snake moving, it should be possible.\n\nBut I have to specify the actions.\n\nFor now, on t39, move U.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nSince the state after each move might depend, but I can plan a sequence.\n\nBut to be safe, I can output for t39 to t43 or t44.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nAlso, for t41, after eating, moving L to (5,5) is better than U to (6,6) to avoid corner.\n\nSo I think that's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L (to (5,5))\n\nThen for turn 42, I can move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6), but to go towards (1,6), moving L to (4,5) is better.\n\nSimilarly, turn 43: from (4,5), move to (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is free, and not wall.\n\nThen turn 44: from (3,5), move to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 45: from (2,5), move to (2,6)\n\nTurn 46: from (2,6), move L to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output from t39 onwards for a few turns, not necessarily all.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince it's turn 39, I can do up to turn 43 or 44.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother option: on turn 39, if I move down, but I think up is better.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the risk.\n\nBut I think moving up to eat the food is low risk and gains score.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nSo for turn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nThen for turn 42, I need to choose, but since I have to output, I can say move L to (4,5)\n\nBut the action is direction.\n\nSimilarly, turn 43: from (4,5), I can move to (3,5), which is left, so L.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) is left, so L.\n\nThen turn 44: from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, L.\n\nBut (2,5) is west, so L.\n\nBut let's confirm coordinates: x decreases left, y increases up, I assume.\n\nStandard: U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,5) is left, x-1, so L.\n\nThen from (2,5) to (2,6) is up, U.\n\nBut for the immediate actions, I can output up to turn 41 or 42.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) has life, and I eat it on t40, good.\n\nFor the answer format.\n\nAlso, on turn 41, when I move from (6,5) to (5,5), the head direction changes, but no instant reverse issue, since from (6,5) to (5,5) is left, previous direction was up (from t40 U), so moving left is not reverse, reverse would be down, but down is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nThen for turn 42, I can add, but it's optional, or I can stop.\n\nBut to think ahead, I can plan turn 42 as L to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 43: L to (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is clear.\n\nSo for the box, I'll put multiple turns.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will prioritize eating the positive food at (6,5) due to its proximity and limited lifespan (it disappears after turn 44). Moving up on turn 39 positions the head to eat this food on turn 40. After eating, the snake grows to length 11, and I then move left to (5,5) on turn 41 to avoid being cornered in the top-right and to start navigating toward the other food at (1,6), which has a longer lifespan (until turn 46).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) on turn 42 continues the path toward the left side of the grid, avoiding the internal obstacle at (3,6). On turn 43, moving left to (3,5) brings the snake closer to (1,6) while staying in open space. Finally, moving left to (2,5) on turn 44 sets up for future moves toward (2,6) and then (1,6) to eat the second food, but these are beyond the 5-turn planning horizon.\n\nThis sequence eats one food immediately, gains +1 score, and positions the snake for potential future rewards while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The actions consider the snake's body movement, wall constraints, and food lifespans, with no instant reversals (e.g., from U to D) and no tail reward danger.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 39: Move U (up) to (6,4) to approach the food at (6,5).\n- Turn 40: Move U (up) to (6,5) to eat the food (score +1, length increases to 11).\n- Turn 41: Move L (left) to (5,5) to avoid the top-right corner and head toward (1,6).\n- Turn 42: Move L (left) to (4,5) to continue leftward navigation.\n- Turn 43: Move L (left) to (3,5) to move closer to (1,6) while avoiding (3,6) obstacle.\n- Turn 44: Move L (left) to (2,5) to position for accessing (2,6) and (1,6) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: L \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: L \\\\\nTurn 44: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 0 to 7 inclusive, but since walls occupy those cells, the snake can only be from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me list the snake positions to verify.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nSo head is at (6,4), and tail at (2,5). The grid goes from x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, but walls are at borders, so snake can be at x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? Let's see: positions include (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), etc., so x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are playable, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is given, so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 5 (disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so it has 5 turns left now)\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\nBut (2,4) is also a snake body segment. Let's see the snake positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\n(2,4) is the 7th segment in the list, index 6 if 0-based, so it's part of the body. But food can spawn under the body, as per rules. So there's food at (2,4), which is currently occupied by the snake body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away, and then head moves onto it.\n\nCurrent head direction is U (up), so moving up increases y-coordinate.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: Since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move D this turn. I can move U, L, or R.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6)\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions: list of coordinates, head at (6,4)\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), tail: (2,5)\n\nTail is (2,5), and (1,5) is before tail.\n\nThe list is: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5) tail.\n\n(2,5) is tail, and (1,5) is second last.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (6,5): value 1, life span 5\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,4): value 1, life span 10, but currently occupied by snake body at position index 6.\n\n(2,4) is a food position, but it's under the snake body. To eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nLife span: for (6,5), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so after turn 40+4=44? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at current turn t=40, life_span=5, so it will disappear at the end of turn 44? Countdown: at turn 40, countdown=5, after turn 40, countdown=4, after turn 41, countdown=3, ..., after turn 44, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 45 or after? Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, after turn 40, countdown becomes 4, so it has 5 turns from now: turns 40,41,42,43,44, and after turn 44, it disappears, so not available on turn 45.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 7: available for 7 turns, turns 40 to 46, disappears after turn 46.\n\n(2,4) life span 10: turns 40 to 49.\n\nNow, head at (6,4), direction U, so possible moves: U to (6,5), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move R. x=7 is wall, so (7,4) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, D is opposite, cannot move.\n\nSo only possible moves: U or L.\n\nU: (6,5)\n\nL: (5,4)\n\nNow, (6,5) has food, positive, value 1.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (6,5), and tail stays, so snake length increases by one.\n\nAfter eating, the new segment is added to head, so positions become: new head at (6,5), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, and so on, tail (2,5) remains, but since length increases, tail doesn't move when eating, so the last segment stays.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n\nSo if I move U to (6,5), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows: new positions: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — tail is still (2,5), and now there are 11 segments? Original had 10 segments, after eating, length increases by one, so 11 segments.\n\nOriginal: 10 positions, length 10.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (6,5), and the segment that was tail (2,5) is not removed, so positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] — (2,5) is still there, but (1,5) is before it, and (2,4) is part of body.\n\n(2,4) is the food position, but now after moving, if I move U, head is at (6,5), so (2,4) is still occupied by body, index 7 in new list? Let's index new positions:\n\n0: (6,5) head\n\n1: (6,4)\n\n2: (6,3)\n\n3: (5,3)\n\n4: (4,3)\n\n5: (4,4)\n\n6: (3,4)\n\n7: (2,4)  // this is where food is, but it's still body\n\n8: (1,4)\n\n9: (1,5)\n\n10: (2,5) tail\n\nSo (2,4) is still occupied, food not eaten yet.\n\nNow, if I move L to (5,4), no food there, so no eat, snake moves: head to (5,4), then body follows, so tail (2,5) is removed, new positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] — tail is (1,5), and (2,5) is gone.\n\nOriginal positions: head (6,4), body (6,3) to tail (2,5)\n\nIf move L to (5,4), no eat, so head moves to (5,4), then each segment moves to previous position, so (6,4) moves to where head was? Standard: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new head: (5,4)\n\nThen segment 1 (was (6,3)) moves to where head was? Positions: index 0 new: (5,4)\n\nIndex 1: previous head (6,4)\n\nIndex 2: previous index 1 (6,3)\n\nIndex 3: previous index 2 (5,3)\n\nIndex 4: previous index 3 (4,3)\n\nIndex 5: previous index 4 (4,4)\n\nIndex 6: previous index 5 (3,4)\n\nIndex 7: previous index 6 (2,4)\n\nIndex 8: previous index 7 (1,4)\n\nIndex 9: previous index 8 (1,5)\n\nPrevious index 9 was (2,5), but since no eat, tail is removed, so only 9 segments now.\n\nTail was (2,5), not included, so positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), and (1,5) is the last? Previous index 8 was (1,5), so it moves to position of previous index 7, which is (1,4)? Let's list previous indices.\n\nPrevious positions: idx 0: (6,4) head\n\nidx 1: (6,3)\n\nidx 2: (5,3)\n\nidx 3: (4,3)\n\nidx 4: (4,4)\n\nidx 5: (3,4)\n\nidx 6: (2,4)\n\nidx 7: (1,4)\n\nidx 8: (1,5)\n\nidx 9: (2,5) tail\n\nAfter move L to (5,4), no eat:\n\nNew head: (5,4)  // new position\n\nThen new idx 1: previous head (6,4)\n\nNew idx 2: previous idx 1 (6,3)\n\nNew idx 3: previous idx 2 (5,3)\n\nNew idx 4: previous idx 3 (4,3)\n\nNew idx 5: previous idx 4 (4,4)\n\nNew idx 6: previous idx 5 (3,4)\n\nNew idx 7: previous idx 6 (2,4)\n\nNew idx 8: previous idx 7 (1,4)\n\nNew idx 9: previous idx 8 (1,5)  // now tail\n\nPrevious idx 9 (2,5) is not included, so tail is at (1,5), and length is 9.\n\n(2,4) is still there, but it's part of body.\n\nBack to current turn.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nPossible actions this turn: U or L.\n\nU: move to (6,5), eat food, grow to length 11.\n\nL: move to (5,4), no eat, shrink to length 9? No, not shrink, length decreases because no eat, but in terms of positions, it has one less segment.\n\nLength is reduced by one if no food eaten.\n\nBut in this case, moving L, no food, so length becomes 9.\n\nMoving U, eat food, length 11.\n\nNow, the food at (2,4) is under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIf the snake moves in a way that this cell is vacated, then later head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo I need to be careful with that.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\n- (6,5): available turns 40-44\n\n- (1,6): available turns 40-46\n\n- (2,4): available turns 40-49, but under body, so not accessible until body moves away.\n\nNow, at turn 40, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nMove U to (6,5): eat food, score +1, length 11, new head at (6,5), direction now U (since moved up).\n\nThen next turn, from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but D is down to (6,4), which is now body, so collision if move D.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, but y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is not wall, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok.\n\nx=6, y=6.\n\nL to (5,5)\n\nR to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,4), which is body, collision.\n\nSo from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5)\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), no food there, so move, length same, tail moves.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both options at turn 40.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,5), eat food.\n\nThen snake: head (6,5), body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nDirection: after moving U, direction is U.\n\nNow turn 41, from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), or D to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision, so only U or L.\n\n(6,6) is playable, no wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), not here.\n\nIf move U to (6,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,6), then body: (6,5) to where head was, etc., tail (2,5) removed, so new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) — tail at (1,5), length 10? After eating, we had 11 segments, now no eat, so move, tail removed, length 10.\n\nFrom 11 positions, after move no eat, head new position, each body to previous, tail removed, so 10 positions.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (5,5), no food, move to (5,5), then body follows, tail removed.\n\nBut (5,5) has no food.\n\nNow, if at turn 40 I move L instead.\n\nMove L to (5,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,4), then body: (6,4) to where head was, (6,3) to previous (6,3)? New positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail, length 9.\n\nDirection after move L is L (left).\n\nNow, from here, possible moves: since direction L, can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n\nL to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is body, currently occupied by segment, so if move D to (5,3), collision.\n\n(4,4) is body? In new positions, (4,4) is index 5? New positions after move L: idx 0: (5,4) head, idx 1: (6,4), idx 2: (6,3), idx 3: (5,3), idx 4: (4,3), idx 5: (4,4), idx 6: (3,4), idx 7: (2,4), idx 8: (1,4), idx 9: (1,5) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) is idx 5, body, (5,3) is idx 3, body.\n\nSo from (5,4), move L to (4,4): (4,4) is body, collision.\n\nMove U to (5,5): no body, no food.\n\nMove D to (5,3): (5,3) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (5,5).\n\nIf I move L at turn 40, then at turn 41, I must move U to (5,5), no choice.\n\nThen at (5,5), no food, so move, head to (5,5), body follows, tail removed, new tail at (1,4)? After move U to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail, length 9? From previous, after turn 40 move L, we have 9 segments, after move U no eat, still 9, but tail changes.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then idx 1: previous head (5,4), idx 2: (6,4), idx 3: (6,3), idx 4: (5,3), idx 5: (4,3), idx 6: (4,4), idx 7: (3,4), idx 8: (2,4), idx 9: (1,4) tail. (1,5) was tail, but removed, so tail at (1,4).\n\nNow, food at (2,4) is still there, under body, idx 8.\n\nBut it can be eaten later if body moves away.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (2,4). It's under the body, so to eat it, the snake needs to move so that (2,4) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by body.\n\nIn the snake path, as the snake moves, the body moves, so (2,4) will be vacated when the tail moves away, but tail is at (1,5) or something.\n\nLet's see the current tail position.\n\nAt turn 40, before move, tail is at (2,5).\n\nIf I don't eat, tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I move U at turn 40, eat, tail stays at (2,5).\n\nIf I move L, no eat, tail moves to (1,5).\n\nThen later, the body at (2,4) will be vacated when the snake moves.\n\nBut since food is there, when vacated, the food is still there, and head can eat it by moving to that cell.\n\nBut there's a danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two choices for turn 40.\n\nIf I move U, I get immediate reward, but I might get stuck.\n\nAfter moving U to (6,5), at turn 41, I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), then at (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5) body; L to (5,6); R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is playable.\n\nThen from (5,6), etc.\n\nBut the grid has an obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) is available.\n\nIf I move L to (5,5) at turn 41 from (6,5), then at (5,5), I can go to (5,6), (4,5), (5,4) but (5,4) is body, etc.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAnother food at (1,6), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,5) or (1,5) depending on move.\n\nI should consider the map.\n\nLet me sketch the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nPlayable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,6) so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions at turn 40:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), tail: (2,5)\n\nSo let's list cells:\n\n(6,4): head\n\n(6,3): body\n\n(5,3): body\n\n(4,3): body\n\n(4,4): body\n\n(3,4): body\n\n(2,4): body (and food here, but under body)\n\n(1,4): body\n\n(1,5): body\n\n(2,5): tail\n\nFood: (6,5), (1,6), (2,4) under body.\n\n(2,4) has food and body.\n\nNow, for turn 40, move U or L.\n\nIf move U to (6,5): eat food, grow. New head (6,5), direction U.\n\nNow positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nFood at (6,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (2,4) still there.\n\n(2,4) still under body.\n\nAt turn 41, from (6,5), move U or L.\n\nIf move U to (6,6): no food, so move, head to (6,6), then body follows, tail (2,5) removed, so new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail. Length 10.\n\n(2,4) is still body, idx 8.\n\nThen at (6,6), can only move L to (5,6) because U and R invalid, D to (6,5) body.\n\nMove L to (5,6), no food, so head to (5,6), body follows, tail removed, new tail at (1,4)? Positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail. (1,5) was tail, removed, so tail at (1,4).\n\n(2,4) still body.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5) but (1,5) is not tail anymore, tail is at (1,4).\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall invalid; D to (5,5); L to (4,6); R to (6,6) body.\n\nSo only D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is playable, no obstacle.\n\n(5,5) is also playable.\n\nIf I go to (4,6), then I can go towards (1,6) food.\n\n(1,6) is food, value 1.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 41 from (6,5), I could move L to (5,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), no food, move, head to (5,5), body follows, tail removed, positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail. Length 10, tail at (1,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) body.\n\n(5,4) is body? In positions, idx 2 is (6,4), so (5,4) is not occupied, let's see: positions: idx 0: (5,5), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (3,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5) tail? After move to (5,5), no eat, so from previous 11 positions, head moved to (5,5), then each body to previous position, tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no eat: new head (5,5)\n\nNew idx 1: previous head (6,5)\n\nNew idx 2: previous idx 1 (6,4)\n\nNew idx 3: previous idx 2 (6,3)\n\nNew idx 4: previous idx 3 (5,3)\n\nNew idx 5: previous idx 4 (4,3)\n\nNew idx 6: previous idx 5 (4,4)\n\nNew idx 7: previous idx 6 (3,4)\n\nNew idx 8: previous idx 7 (2,4)\n\nNew idx 9: previous idx 8 (1,4)\n\nNew idx 10: previous idx 9 (1,5)  // tail, since previous idx 10 was (2,5), not included.\n\nSo positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nSo (5,4) is not occupied, it's free.\n\nFrom (5,5), can move D to (5,4), U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5) body, so invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,4), U to (5,6), L to (4,5).\n\nBut let's go back to turn 40 choice.\n\nIf at turn 40 I move L to (5,4), no eat, so positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail, length 9.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen at turn 41, as I said, only move U to (5,5), because L to (4,4) body, D to (5,3) body.\n\nMove U to (5,5), no food, so positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail. (1,5) was tail, removed, so tail at (1,4).\n\n(2,4) still body.\n\nFrom (5,5), can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) is not body, in positions, (6,4) is body, (6,5) is free? Positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc., so (6,5) is free.\n\nR to (6,5) is possible.\n\nD to (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nL to (4,5) free.\n\nU to (5,6) free.\n\nSo from (5,5), possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nR to (6,5) which has food, but food at (6,5) was available, life span 5, at turn 40, so at turn 41, countdown 4, still available.\n\nIf move R to (6,5), eat food, grow.\n\nThen new head at (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,4). It's under the body, and the body is moving slowly.\n\nThe cell (2,4) will be vacated when the tail moves past it.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5) or (2,5), etc.\n\nIn the current snake configuration, the tail is at (2,5), and the body at (2,4) is just before tail in the chain, but in terms of position, (2,4) and (2,5) are adjacent.\n\nThe snake can move to vacate (2,4).\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the tail moves to (2,4) or away.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4), so when the tail moves away from (2,4), it will be vacated, and food is there, so head can eat it later.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nSo I need to avoid that situation.\n\nFirst, let's see when (2,4) can be vacated.\n\nSuppose at some point, the snake moves so that the segment at (2,4) moves to another position, vacating (2,4).\n\nFor example, if the tail is at (2,5), and we move, the tail might move to (1,5) or something.\n\nAt turn 40, if I do nothing, but I have to move.\n\nLet's simulate the vacating of (2,4).\n\nCurrent positions: head (6,4), tail (2,5), and (2,4) is body.\n\nIf I move the snake, the body will move.\n\nFor instance, if I move U at turn 40, eat, tail stays at (2,5), so (2,4) still occupied.\n\nThen when I move from there, tail may move later.\n\nIf I move L at turn 40, no eat, tail moves to (1,5), so (2,4) is still occupied by the same segment, but the segment that was at (2,4) is now at a new position? Let's see.\n\nAfter move L at turn 40: head to (5,4), then body: (6,4) to where head was, (6,3) to previous (6,3)? New positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,4) is still at (2,4), because it moved to the position of the previous segment, but the previous segment was (3,4), which moved to (2,4)? In the list, previous idx 6 was (2,4), but after move, new idx 7 is (2,4), same position.\n\nThe positions are not changing for that cell yet.\n\nThe cell (2,4) will be vacated when the segment that occupies it moves to another cell, and no new segment comes.\n\nSpecifically, when the tail moves away from that area or the snake changes direction.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves down or something.\n\nCurrently, the snake is mostly horizontal in the left part.\n\nFrom the positions, the snake has a bend at (4,4) and (4,3), etc.\n\nTo vacate (2,4), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (2,4) moves to a different cell.\n\nFor instance, if the head moves in a way that the body moves south or something.\n\nLet's think about the tail.\n\nAt turn 40, tail at (2,5).\n\nIf I don't eat, at turn 40 move L, tail moves to (1,5).\n\nThen at (2,4), it is still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 41, move U to (5,5), then tail moves to (1,4), so the segment at (2,4) moves to where? In the move to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail.\n\n(2,4) still occupied.\n\nThen from here, if I move the head, say, U to (5,6), then positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) but (2,4) is still there, and tail at (1,4) removed, new tail at (2,4)? After move to (5,6) no eat, new head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) tail. So (2,4) is now the tail position.\n\nWhen the tail is at (2,4), and there is food on it, but it's under the tail.\n\nFood can be under body or tail, but to eat it, the body must move away, then head moves on.\n\nSo when the tail moves from (2,4), the cell is vacated, and food is there, so head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut if at that moment, head is adjacent, it might be dangerous.\n\nCurrently, with the snake stretched, head is at (6,4), far from (2,4).\n\nSo if I can arrange for the head to be near (2,4) when it is vacated, I can eat it safely.\n\nBut life span is 10, plenty of time.\n\nOther foods have shorter life.\n\n(6,5) has life span 5, so only available for 5 turns.\n\n(1,6) has 7 turns.\n\n(2,4) has 10 turns.\n\nSo (6,5) is urgent, must be eaten soon or lost.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has more time.\n\nAt turn 40, if I don't eat (6,5), it might disappear soon.\n\nBut if I move L, I can still eat it later.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, move L to (5,4), then at turn 41, move U to (5,5), then at turn 42, I can move R to (6,5) to eat the food, if it's still there.\n\nAt turn 42, food at (6,5) has countdown 3 at turn 40, at turn 41 countdown 2, at turn 42 countdown 1, still available, after turn 42 countdown 0, disappears.\n\nAt turn 42, if I move to (6,5), I can eat it.\n\nLet's see if possible.\n\nAfter turn 40 move L: positions at turn 41: after move U to (5,5), positions as above: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail.\n\nAt turn 41, from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nThen new head at (6,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) and new segment, so tail at (1,4), but since grow, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail. Length 10, tail at (1,4).\n\n(2,4) is still body, with food under it.\n\nBut the food at (6,5) is eaten.\n\nSo by moving L at turn 40, then U and R, I can still eat the food at (6,5) at turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U at turn 40, I eat it immediately.\n\nBut moving U might put me in a corner.\n\nAfter moving U to (6,5), at turn 41, I have to move U or L.\n\nIf move U to (6,6), then at (6,6), only move L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), etc., but I'm near the top right.\n\nThen to get to (1,6) food, I have to go left, but there's obstacle at (3,6), so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), then to (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, blocked, so cannot move to (3,6).\n\nSo from (4,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), L to (3,6) invalid, R to (5,6) body.\n\nSo only D to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), and so on.\n\nIt might take time to reach the left side.\n\nWhereas if I move L at turn 40, I stay more central, and can go to (1,6) sooner.\n\nAlso, for the food at (2,4), it's under body, and will be vacated when the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,5) or moving.\n\nIn the case where I move L at turn 40, no eat, tail at (1,5).\n\nThen after turn 41 move U to (5,5), tail at (1,4).\n\nThen the body at (2,4) is still there.\n\nLater, when the snake moves, the tail will move from (1,4), but (2,4) is occupied by a segment that will move when the head moves.\n\nFor example, if from (5,5) at turn 41, I move R to (6,5) as above, then positions with tail at (1,4).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to other places.\n\nTo vacate (2,4), I need to move the head in a way that the body segment at (2,4) moves.\n\nSince the snake is long, it takes many moves for changes to propagate.\n\nThe cell (2,4) will be the tail when the tail reaches that position.\n\nFor example, in the positions after turn 41 with head at (6,5) and tail at (1,4), the segments are: (6,5) head, (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail.\n\nSo (2,4) is the second last segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so when tail moves from (1,4), it will go to where? Depends on the direction, but since the snake is moving, the tail will follow the path.\n\nSpecifically, when the head moves, the segment at (2,4) will move to the position of (3,4) or something, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think that (2,4) will be vacated when the tail is at (2,4) and then the tail moves away.\n\nBut when the tail is at (2,4), if there is food, and head moves to it, but if head is adjacent, danger.\n\nBut currently, head is far.\n\nSo to eat the food at (2,4), I need to have the head near when the cell is vacated.\n\nBut since life span is long, I can do it later.\n\nFor now, the priority is to eat the food with short life.\n\n(6,5) has only 5 turns, so I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has 7 turns.\n\nAt turn 40, if I move U, I eat (6,5) immediately, score +1, but I might get stuck in the corner.\n\nIf I move L, I can still eat (6,5) at turn 42, as above.\n\nBut at turn 42, it might be risky if something, but in the path I described, it should be ok.\n\nAlso, by moving L, I avoid going to the corner.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (1,6), which I can reach.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), which blocks the top row.\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I need to go through y=5 or lower.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, at turn 40, I choose to move L to (5,4), so that I can go towards center and have more options.\n\nThen at turn 41, from (5,4) direction L, but after move L to (5,4), direction is L, then move U to (5,5), so direction changes to U.\n\nThen at turn 41, from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, at (6,5), I can then move, say, D or L or U, but D to (6,4) is body, U to (6,6), L to (5,5) body.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) or if possible, but only U or L, but L to (5,5) body, so only U to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), only L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), but (5,5) may be body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) at turn 42, positions depend.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nTurn 40: move L to (5,4), no eat. Positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) tail. Direction L.\n\nTurn 41: move U to (5,5), no eat. Positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail. Direction U.\n\nTurn 42: move R to (6,5), eat food (6,5). New head (6,5), then body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) and new segment, so tail at (1,4). Length 11. Direction R.\n\nNow at (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) body, L to (5,5) body, R invalid. So only U to (6,6).\n\nTurn 43: move U to (6,6), no eat. Positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) tail? After move no eat, tail removed. New positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) tail. Tail at (2,4), which has food, but it's under tail.\n\n(2,4) is tail position, and food is there.\n\nTo eat it, the tail must move away, vacating the cell, then head moves to it.\n\nBut currently head is at (6,6), far away.\n\nAlso, when tail moves, the food is exposed, and head can eat it.\n\nBut there might be a danger if head is adjacent when it happens.\n\nNow from (6,6), only move L to (5,6).\n\nTurn 44: move L to (5,6), no eat. Positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) tail. Tail at (3,4), and (2,4) is vacated, so food at (2,4) is now exposed.\n\nAt turn 44, after move to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nSo (2,4) is free, and food is there.\n\nHead is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is at distance.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (2,4).\n\nBut there are other foods.\n\nFood at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is available.\n\nAt turn 44, head at (5,6), I can move to (1,6) to eat, but it's far.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6): U to (5,7) wall invalid; D to (5,5); L to (4,6); R to (6,6) body.\n\n(5,5) is body, in positions, (5,5) is idx 3, body.\n\n(4,6) is free.\n\nSo move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5) body, collision, so only L to (4,6).\n\nTurn 44: move L to (4,6), no food. Positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail. (3,4) was tail, removed, tail at (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is free with food.\n\nBut head at (4,6), I can go down to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,6) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), move D to (4,5), then to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, etc.\n\nIt will take several turns to reach (2,4), and food at (1,6) might be closer.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), from (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, so I have to move D to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then U to (2,6), then L to (1,6), for example.\n\nBut (2,6) might be free.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) life span 7, at turn 40, so available until turn 46.\n\nAt turn 44, countdown 3, available turns 44,45,46.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) available until turn 49.\n\nBut in this path, after turn 44, head at (4,6), I can go to (1,6) in a few moves.\n\nFor example, turn 45: from (4,6), move D to (4,5) (assume no body, in positions, (4,5) is free? Positions at turn 44: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is free.\n\nMove D to (4,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 46: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), no food.\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nTurn 47: move L to (2,5), no food.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nTurn 48: move U to (2,6), no food.\n\n(2,6) free.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (1,6), eat food.\n\nBut at turn 49, food at (1,6) life span 7, at turn 40, turn 49 is after 9 turns, countdown 7-9= -2, gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 40, countdown 7, after turn 40, countdown 6, ..., after turn 46, countdown 0, so not available on turn 47.\n\nAt turn 46, countdown 1, available, after turn 46, countdown 0, disappears.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I must be on (1,6) on or before turn 46.\n\nAt turn 44, head at (4,6), I can move directly to (1,6) but can't because of obstacle.\n\nPath: from (4,6) at turn 44, move D to (4,5) turn 45.\n\nThen from (4,5), move L to (3,5) turn 46.\n\n(3,5) is not (1,6), so at turn 46, I am at (3,5), not (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at distance.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, or D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body or something.\n\nAt turn 46, positions depend on previous moves.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 46, from (4,5) move L to (3,5), so head at (3,5), and food at (1,6) is available this turn (countdown 1), but I am at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nTo reach (1,6) in one move, impossible, so I miss the food at (1,6) if I go this way.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 44, I could move to other directions, but I need to go west.\n\nMove L to (4,6) at turn 44, but only L to (4,6)? From (5,6) at turn 43, I moved to (4,6) at turn 44.\n\nAt turn 44 head at (4,6), I can only move D to (4,5) since U and L invalid, R body.\n\nSo only D.\n\nThen at (4,5), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (4,6) body, D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) body.\n\n(4,4) is body, in positions idx 10 is (4,4), body.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\n(5,5) body.\n\nSo only L to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), similar, can move U to (3,6) invalid, D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) body.\n\n(3,4) may be body, in current positions, at turn 45 after move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail. (4,4) was tail, removed, tail at (4,3).\n\nSo (3,4) is free.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 45, move L to (3,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 46: from (3,5), can move D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or U invalid, R to (4,5) body.\n\n(3,4) is free, (2,5) free.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), from (3,5), move L to (2,5), then at turn 47, move U to (2,6), then turn 48 move L to (1,6), but turn 48 is after turn 46, food gone.\n\nAt turn 46, food available last time.\n\nAt turn 46, head at (3,5), not at (1,6), so cannot eat, food disappears after turn 46.\n\nSo I miss (1,6).\n\nIf I had gone directly towards (1,6) earlier.\n\nBut in the beginning, after eating (6,5), I went to (6,6) and (5,6), which is east, while (1,6) is west.\n\nSo by moving U at turn 40, I might have missed the opportunity for (1,6).\n\nWhereas if I move L at turn 40, I can eat (6,5) at turn 42 and then go west for (1,6).\n\nFor example, turn 40 move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 41 move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 42 move R to (6,5) eat\n\nThen at (6,5), I must move U to (6,6) as before.\n\nTurn 43 move U to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 44 move L to (5,6)\n\nNow at (5,6), instead of moving L to (4,6), I can move D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, or only L to (4,6) as before.\n\nFrom (5,6), moves: U invalid, D to (5,5) body, L to (4,6), R body, so only L to (4,6).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), I am forced to go up and left, away from (1,6).\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I need to go down first, but from (6,5), I can only go U, not D.\n\nSo once I eat at (6,5), I am stuck going to (6,6) and then left, which delays reaching west.\n\nIf at turn 40 I move L, and then at turn 42 I don't eat (6,5), I can go west earlier.\n\nBut (6,5) will disappear soon.\n\nAt turn 40 move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 41 move U to (5,5)\n\nThen at turn 41, from (5,5), instead of moving R to (6,5), I can move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), for example.\n\nTurn 41: from (5,5) move L to (4,5), no food. Positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) tail. Direction L.\n\nThen I can go to (1,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5), turn 42.\n\nThen to (2,5), turn 43.\n\nThen to (2,6), turn 44.\n\nThen to (1,6), turn 45.\n\nAt turn 45, food at (1,6) countdown: at turn 40, countdown 7, turn 41:6, turn42:5, turn43:4, turn44:3, turn45:2, available, so eat at turn 45.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at turn 42 countdown 3, but I didn't eat it, and by turn 45, it might be gone or not, but I can eat (1,6) at turn 45.\n\nThen for (2,4), I can eat later.\n\nBut in this case, I missed (6,5), which is a point.\n\nBut since both are value 1, it's similar, but (6,5) is closer in the first path.\n\nBut to prioritize survival, going to the corner might be riskier.\n\nAlso, with the obstacle, the top row is partially blocked.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (6,5) at turn 42, at (6,5), I move U to (6,6), then to (5,6), then I can move down from there.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), it takes time.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) at turn 44, move L to (4,6), turn 45 move D to (4,5), turn 46 move L to (3,5), then at turn 46, I am at (3,5), (1,6) available this turn, but not there, so miss.\n\nIf from (4,6) at turn 45, I move directly west, but (3,6) blocked, so I have to go down to y=5.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 45, move D to (4,5), then at turn 46, from (4,5) move L to (3,5), but (3,5) not (1,6), and no move to (1,6) in one step, so miss.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (1,6) in time if I go to the east first.\n\nTherefore, better to move L at turn 40 and then go west to eat (1,6) first, then maybe eat (2,4) later.\n\nAt turn 40, move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 41, from (5,5) after move U, move L to (4,5) instead of R.\n\nThen turn 42: from (4,5) move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 43: from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 44: from (2,5) move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 45: from (2,6) move L to (1,6) eat food.\n\nAt turn 45, eat (1,6), score +1.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move to other places.\n\nFor (2,4) food, it is under body, but in this process, at some point it might be vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, before moves, (2,4) occupied.\n\nAfter moving, at turn 41, positions with head at (4,5), body includes (2,4) still.\n\nLater, as tail moves, (2,4) will be vacated.\n\nBut in the above path, at turn 45, head at (1,6), tail at some position.\n\nAfter eating at (1,6), new head (1,6), body grows, tail stays.\n\nBut (2,4) might be free or not.\n\nSince life span 10, I can eat it later.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence for about 5 turns.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns.\n\nBut it might be open-ended.\n\nPerhaps I should provide actions for the next 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut let's decide for turn 40.\n\nGiven the risk of getting stuck in the corner and missing (1,6), I think it's better to move L at turn 40 to have more flexibility.\n\nSo for turn 40: move L\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to provide.\n\nBut the user might expect the sequence.\n\nSince the state is given, and I need to maximize score, with survival.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,4) is under body, and when vacated, I can eat it.\n\nBut in the west path, I can eat it soon.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,6), head at (1,6), then I can move down to (1,5) or something.\n\nBut let's see the current positions.\n\nAt turn 40, after move L, positions head (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to save time, for the answer, I'll provide turn 40 action.\n\nThen for thinking ahead.\n\nPerhaps for turn 40, move L.\n\nThen turn 41, move U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 42, move L to (4,5) to go west.\n\nThen turn 43, move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44, move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 45, move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 46, move L to (1,6) eat, but turn 46 is last chance for (1,6), so move directly if possible, but from (2,5) to (1,6) not adjacent, need to go to (2,6) first.\n\nAt turn 45, from (2,5) move U to (2,6), then turn 46 move L to (1,6) eat.\n\nAt turn 46, food available, so eat.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) can be eaten after.\n\nBut (2,4) is at (2,4), which is near.\n\nAt turn 45, head at (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), but (2,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nLet's not sequence too far.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide for turns 40 to 44 or something.\n\nBut let's include eating.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) is only available if I eat it soon, but in this west path, I don't eat it, so I lose that point.\n\nBut (1,6) is also +1, same value.\n\nAnd by going west, I avoid the corner.\n\nAlso, for long-term, the snake can survive better in the center.\n\nMoreover, with the internal obstacle, the top row is risky.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 40 is better.\n\nThen for turn 41, move U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 42, move L to (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=40.\n\nSo actions for turn 40,41,42,43,44.\n\nBut let's define.\n\nTurn 40: move L\n\nThen turn 41: from (5,4), move U to (5,5) as only choice.\n\nTurn 42: from (5,5), move L to (4,5) to go west.\n\nTurn 43: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44: from (3,5), move L to (2,5) or to (2,6), but to reach (1,6), better move to (2,5) first.\n\nFrom (3,5), moves: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), etc.\n\nL to (2,5) is fine.\n\nThen turn 45: from (2,5) move U to (2,6)\n\nBut turn 45 is beyond 44.\n\nSince food at (1,6) needs to be eaten by turn 46, I can include up to there.\n\nBut the answer might expect only a few turns.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with move L at turn 40.\n\nSo action for turn 40: L\n\nThen for the sequence, in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nHead direction after move.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions for each turn.\n\nSince the state is given, and I need to think ahead, but for output, I can start with turn 40 action.\n\nPerhaps the system will simulate.\n\nBut for this response, I'll provide the action for turn 40 and maybe the next few.\n\nBut to be complete.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 40, if I move U, I eat immediately, score +1, and then I can try to go west, but from (6,6) and (5,6), I can move down, but it takes time, and I might miss (1,6), but (1,6) has more life, life span 7 vs 5 for (6,5), so (6,5) is more urgent, but I can eat it at turn 42 as well.\n\nIn terms of score, both give +1, so no difference.\n\nBut by eating (6,5) at turn 40, I have a longer snake, which might be harder to maneuver, while with move L, I have shorter snake initially.\n\nAt turn 40, if move U, length 11 after eat, if move L, length 9, then if I eat at turn 42, length 10 or 11.\n\nNot significant.\n\nI think move L is safer.\n\nSo I'll go with L for turn 40.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends and collisions while targeting high-value food. The current state (turn 40) has the snake head at (6,4) facing U (up). The available food includes (6,5) with a short lifespan (5 turns, expiring after turn 44), (1,6) with a moderate lifespan (7 turns, expiring after turn 46), and (2,4) under the snake's body with a long lifespan (10 turns, expiring after turn 49). The internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks part of the top row, making navigation to (1,6) challenging.\n\n### Key Considerations for Decision:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 40)**: From (6,4), moving U eats (6,5) but traps the snake near the top-right corner (only U or L moves are possible from (6,5), leading to (6,6) and then forced left). Moving L to (5,4) avoids the corner, keeps options open, and allows reaching (1,6) before it expires.\n- **Food Prioritization**: (6,5) must be eaten by turn 44, and (1,6) by turn 46. (2,4) can be eaten later due to its long lifespan. Missing (1,6) is likely if the snake goes to (6,5) first, as the path west is slow (due to the (3,6) obstacle). Thus, targeting (1,6) first is better for long-term score.\n- **Survival Risks**: Moving U on turn 40 risks cornering the snake at (6,6) with limited escape routes. Moving L maintains central positioning and flexibility. The food at (2,4) under the body will be vacated as the tail moves; eating it requires the head to be nearby but not adjacent to the tail when vacated to avoid \"Tail Reward Danger.\"\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turn 40**: Move L to (5,4) to avoid the corner and start moving west toward (1,6).\n  - **Turn 41**: From (5,4), move U to (5,5) (only safe move; D and L cause collisions).\n  - **Turn 42**: From (5,5), move L to (4,5) to continue west toward (1,6). Skipping (6,5) is acceptable as (1,6) has equal value and is reachable.\n  - **Turn 43**: From (4,5), move L to (3,5) to approach (1,6). (3,6) is blocked, so path must go via y=5.\n  - **Turn 44**: From (3,5), move L to (2,5) to set up for (1,6) on turn 45. (2,4) food is not yet vacated but can be eaten later.\n  - **Beyond (5 turns)**: On turn 45, move U to (2,6), then turn 46 move L to (1,6) to eat before expiration. (2,4) can be targeted once vacated (e.g., when tail moves away).\n\nThis sequence eats (1,6) by turn 46, avoids the risky corner, and sets up for (2,4) later. Moving U on turn 40 would eat (6,5) immediately but likely miss (1,6) and increase collision risk.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 40 to 44):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 41: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 42: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 43: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 44: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 41,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 41, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since x and y go from 0 to 7.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (2,4) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food. But I need to check if any are negative; all are +1, so no negative food here.\n\nNow, life span: for (6,5), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 41, it will disappear after turn 44? Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at (6,5) with life span 4 on turn 41:\n\n- Turn 41: life span 4\n\n- Turn 42: life span 3\n\n- Turn 43: life span 2\n\n- Turn 44: life span 1\n\n- Turn 45: life span 0, disappears? Or does it disappear when life span reaches 0?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N on turn t, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear on turn t + N? I need to be careful.\n\nTypically, if countdown starts at N and decreases each turn, it disappears when countdown reaches 0. For example, on turn t with life span N, after that turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N on turn t, it has N turns left including turn t. After N turns, it will be gone. For (6,5) on turn 41 with life span 4, it will disappear after turn 44, meaning it's not there on turn 45. Similarly, (1,6) life span 6, disappears after turn 46, and (2,4) life span 9, disappears after turn 49.\n\nBut (2,4) is also a snake body segment? Let's see the snake positions: snake is at [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\n(2,4) is part of the body, the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5). So (2,4) is the 7th segment? Anyway, it's a body cell.\n\nBut food is at (2,4), which is occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (2,4), since it's under the body, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,4), and then later the head can move to (2,4) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (6,5) and (1,6) are not on snake body, I think. Snake positions: (6,5) is not listed, so it's free. (1,6) is not listed, free. (2,4) is occupied.\n\nNow, head is at (5,4), moving left. So from (5,4), possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because reverse is not allowed. Current direction is L, so I can't move R (right) immediately.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so if current direction is L, I cannot move R. So from (5,4), with direction L, I can move: L (left to (4,4)), U (up to (5,5)), D (down to (5,3)).\n\nNow, what about (4,4)? (4,4) is a body segment, but it's not the tail. The tail is at (1,5). Moving to a body segment would cause collision, except if it's the tail and we're eating food or something, but generally, moving to any body segment except the tail might be dangerous.\n\nCollision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok because when I move, the tail will move away, so no collision. But for other body segments, if I move to them, it's a collision.\n\nIn this case, from (5,4), if I move L to (4,4), (4,4) is a body segment, but it's not the tail. The tail is at (1,5). So moving to (4,4) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (5,5), is that free? Let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells: snake positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nAlso walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (3,6)\n\nSo grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are invalid. Also (3,6) is wall.\n\nNow, from head (5,4):\n\n- Move L to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by snake body (it's the 5th segment? Positions index 5 is (4,4)), so moving there would cause collision. Invalid.\n\n- Move U to (5,5): (5,5) - is this free? Not in snake positions, not wall. Walls are borders and (3,6), so (5,5) should be free.\n\n- Move D to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by snake body (index 3 is (5,3)), so collision, invalid.\n\n- Move R to (6,4): but current direction is L, and R is reverse, not allowed. Also, (6,4) is the first body segment, so even if allowed, it would be collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,4) is U to (5,5), since L, D, R are all invalid or not allowed.\n\nR is not allowed because reverse, L and D are body collision.\n\nSo on turn 41, I must move U to (5,5).\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=41, I need to output actions for turn 41, 42, 43, etc., but how many? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. Probably I should plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since the state might change, I need to simulate.\n\nBut food life span and movements will affect, so I should simulate the next few turns.\n\nFirst, on turn 41, action must be U, as only choice.\n\nSo head moves to (5,5), and snake grows? No, only when eating food. I'm not eating food at (5,5), so no growth, tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving U to (5,5), the new head position is (5,5). The body: the previous head (5,4) becomes part of body, and the tail (1,5) moves to where? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: new positions: head at new position, then segment 1 at old head position, segment 2 at old segment 1 position, and so on, up to the second last segment, and the last segment (tail) is removed, so the old tail cell is empty.\n\nIn this case, snake has 10 segments: positions 0 to 9, head at 0, tail at 9.\n\nAfter move U to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (5,4)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (6,4)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 (6,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 (3,4)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 (2,4)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 (1,4)  // since tail moves, old segment 9 (1,5) is vacated\n\nOld positions: index 0: (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5)\n\nAfter move U to (5,5):\n\n- New position 0 (head): (5,5)\n\n- Position 1: old pos 0 = (5,4)\n\n- Position 2: old pos 1 = (6,4)\n\n- Position 3: old pos 2 = (6,3)\n\n- Position 4: old pos 3 = (5,3)\n\n- Position 5: old pos 4 = (4,3)\n\n- Position 6: old pos 5 = (4,4)\n\n- Position 7: old pos 6 = (3,4)\n\n- Position 8: old pos 7 = (2,4)\n\n- Position 9: old pos 8 = (1,4)  // and old pos 9 (1,5) is now empty\n\nSo new snake positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nHead direction is now U, since I moved up.\n\nFood: (6,5) value 1, life span 4 (on turn 41, so after turn 41, life span decreases to 3 for turn 42)\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 6, decreases to 5\n\n(2,4) life span 9, decreases to 8, but (2,4) is still occupied? In new positions, (2,4) is position 8, so still under body.\n\nNow turn 42: head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R (not D, since reverse not allowed).\n\n- U to (5,6): y=6, is this wall? y=7 is top border, y=0 bottom. y=6 is not border, and no wall at (5,6), so free? Check obstacles.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,6). (5,6) is not wall, not snake? Snake positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), etc., not (5,6), so free.\n\n- L to (4,5): (4,5) - not in snake positions, not wall, free.\n\n- R to (6,5): (6,5) has food! But let's see if I can eat it.\n\n(6,5) has food with value 1, life span now 3 (since decreased after turn 41).\n\nMoving to (6,5) would eat the food, since it's free now.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, what about D? D is down to (5,4), but (5,4) is now the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, and also reverse direction not allowed since current direction U.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nR to (6,5) would eat food.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nThere is also food at (1,6) and (2,4) under body.\n\n(2,4) is still occupied, life span decreasing.\n\nOn turn 42, if I move R to (6,5), I eat the food, get +1 score, snake grows.\n\nThen new head at (6,5), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake positions: head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to old segment 9 (1,4), and no tail removal, so new length 11.\n\nBut I need to see the direction. After moving R, head direction is R.\n\nNow, is there any risk? After eating, the new tail is where? Old tail was at (1,4), and since no movement of tail, it stays, but the segment before it moves or something.\n\nWhen eating food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail position remains the same, but the snake grows.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake increases in length by one, with the new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n\nTypically: head moves to new position (food cell), and the body segments follow, but since food eaten, instead of removing the tail, we keep it, so the snake grows. So the new tail is the old tail, but since we add a segment, the positions shift.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving to food, new head at food cell, then the previous head position, and all body segments remain, so the tail is still there, and we add a new segment at the end? No.\n\nLet's think: before move, snake has positions S0, S1, ..., S9 (10 segments).\n\nAfter moving to food without eating: new head at new pos, S0 to S8 become new segments 1 to 9? Earlier I had for no eat: new head, then old S0, S1, ..., S8 as segments 1 to 9, and S9 removed.\n\nWith eating: head moves to new pos, then old S0, S1, ..., S9 as new segments 1 to 10, so tail is old S9, and we add a new segment at the end, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is added where the tail was, but it's not moving, so the position is the same.\n\nIn position list: after eating, new positions: head at food cell, then the entire previous snake positions, so length increases by one.\n\nFor example, previous positions: S0, S1, S2, ..., S9\n\nAfter moving to food at F and eating: new positions: F (head), S0, S1, S2, ..., S9 (so 11 segments)\n\nS0 is now segment 1, S1 segment 2, ..., S9 segment 10, and tail is S9.\n\nIn this case, for turn 42, if I move to (6,5) and eat food, new snake: head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nLength 11.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, back to turn 41, I have to move U, as only choice.\n\nThen on turn 42, I have options.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal wall at (3,6).\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is wall.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nSnake on turn 41: head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nFood: (6,5), (1,6), (2,4) under body.\n\nAfter turn 41 move U to (5,5): snake as above.\n\nNow turn 42: head (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (5,6): (5,6) is free? Not wall, not snake. (5,6) y=6, but y=7 is border, y=6 is not border. Internal walls only (3,6), so (5,6) free. No food.\n\n- L to (4,5): (4,5) free, no food.\n\n- R to (6,5): (6,5) has food, eat it.\n\nIf I eat at (6,5), as above, snake grows to 11, head at (6,5) dir R.\n\nThen on turn 43, from (6,5) dir R, possible moves: U, D, R (not L, reverse not allowed).\n\n- R to (7,5): but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\n- U to (6,6): (6,6) - y=6, not border, not wall, free? (6,6) should be free.\n\n- D to (6,4): (6,4) is body segment. In new positions after eat, (6,4) is segment 3? Positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ... so (6,4) is segment 3, not tail, so moving there causes collision.\n\nSo from (6,5) dir R, possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, invalid, or R to (7,5) wall, invalid. So only U to (6,6) possible? But D is invalid, R invalid, so only U.\n\nBut what about L? L is left to (5,5), but (5,5) is segment 1, body, collision, and also reverse not allowed since current dir R, L is opposite.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) is possible on turn 43 if I ate on turn 42.\n\nThen head at (6,6), dir U.\n\nThen turn 44: from (6,6) dir U, possible moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; L to (5,6); R to (7,6) x=7 wall invalid; D to (6,5) but (6,5) is previous head, now body? After moving, positions change.\n\nAfter turn 42 eat, snake: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nOn turn 43, move U to (6,6): no eat, so new head (6,6), then segments: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) and tail removed, so (1,4) vacated? Let's see.\n\nAfter move U to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), new segment 1: old head (6,5), new seg2: old seg1 (5,5), new seg3: old seg2 (5,4), new seg4: old seg3 (6,4), new seg5: old seg4 (6,3), new seg6: old seg5 (5,3), new seg7: old seg6 (4,3), new seg8: old seg7 (4,4), new seg9: old seg8 (3,4), new seg10: old seg9 (2,4)  // old seg10 (1,4) vacated\n\nOld positions had 11 segments: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (2,4), 10: (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), then new seg1: old0 (6,5), new seg2: old1 (5,5), new seg3: old2 (5,4), new seg4: old3 (6,4), new seg5: old4 (6,3), new seg6: old5 (5,3), new seg7: old6 (4,3), new seg8: old7 (4,4), new seg9: old8 (3,4), new seg10: old9 (2,4)  // old10 (1,4) removed\n\nSo snake now: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] length 11, head dir U.\n\nNow turn 44: head (6,6) dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5): (6,5) is segment 1, body, collision, invalid.\n\nL to (5,6): (5,6) free? Not snake, not wall, free.\n\nR to (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,6).\n\nThen move to (5,6), no food, so snake moves, tail removed, etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I'm not considering other food.\n\nPerhaps eating at (6,5) on turn 42 is not the best, because it leads me to the top right, and I might get stuck.\n\nThere is food at (1,6) and (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nAlso, (1,6) is available.\n\nOn turn 42, instead of moving R to (6,5), I could move U to (5,6) or L to (4,5).\n\nLet's think about the food at (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is near the top left.\n\nSnake body is from (2,4) to (1,4), etc.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with (2,4) food: it's under body, and if I eat it when head is adjacent to tail, it could be dangerous, but tail is not near now.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (1,4) after turn 41, and food at (2,4) is under body, not tail.\n\nSo not an immediate issue.\n\nTo eat (2,4), I need the body to move away from (2,4) first.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by segment 7 or something.\n\nAfter turn 41 move, snake positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] so (2,4) is position 8, (1,4) position 9 tail.\n\nAs the snake moves, (2,4) will be vacated when that segment moves.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the body moves, eventually (2,4) will be tail or something.\n\nLet's see the snake's path.\n\nFrom turn 42, head at (5,5), I can choose to go towards (1,6) or other.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up from current (5,5).\n\nI could move L to (4,5), then to (3,5), etc., but there's a wall at (3,6), so (3,5) is free, (3,6) wall.\n\n(1,6) life span 6, on turn 41, so turn 42 life span 5, still plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span on turn 42 is 3, so it will disappear after turn 44, meaning not available on turn 45.\n\nLife span: on turn 41, (6,5) life span 4, so available on turns 41,42,43,44; disappears after turn 44, so not on turn 45.\n\nTurn 41: life span 4, present\n\nTurn 42: life span 3, present\n\nTurn 43: life span 2, present\n\nTurn 44: life span 1, present\n\nTurn 45: life span 0, not present\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 6 on turn 41, so available until turn 46.\n\n(2,4) life span 9, until turn 49.\n\nNow, for (2,4) to be eaten, it needs to be free when head moves there.\n\nCurrently, it's occupied by body at position (2,4) in the list.\n\nAs the snake moves, each turn, the body segments shift, so the cell (2,4) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves away, but since the snake moves as a whole, the only way to free a body cell is for the tail to move away from it or for that segment to be the tail when the snake moves without eating.\n\nFor example, if on some turn, the segment at (2,4) is the tail, and I move without eating, then (2,4) is vacated, and food can be eaten if head moves there later.\n\nIn current positions after turn 41, (2,4) is position 8, not tail. Tail is at (1,4).\n\nThe segment at (2,4) will move to the next position when the snake moves.\n\nFor instance, on turn 42, if I move from (5,5) to some direction.\n\nSay I move U to (5,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (2,4)  // old tail (1,4) vacated\n\nSo (2,4) is now position 9, the tail.\n\nThen if I move again without eating, on turn 43, from (5,6) dir U, I can move U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5) body; L to (4,6); R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) and (6,6) free.\n\nSay I move L to (4,6), then new head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), etc., down to seg9 (3,4), and tail at (2,4) vacated? After move to (4,6) no eat, new positions: head (4,6), seg1 old head (5,6), seg2 old seg1 (5,5), seg3 old seg2 (5,4), seg4 old seg3 (6,4), seg5 old seg4 (6,3), seg6 old seg5 (5,3), seg7 old seg6 (4,3), seg8 old seg7 (4,4), seg9 old seg8 (3,4)  // old seg9 (2,4) vacated\n\nSo (2,4) is now free, and food is there, but head is at (4,6), not at (2,4), so I need to move head to (2,4) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,4) is at (2,4), head at (4,6), so I can go down and left.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,4) is now exposed, life span decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, I can plan to eat (1,6) first.\n\nBack to turn 42, head at (5,5), I can move L to (4,5).\n\nThen new head (4,5), dir L (since moved left).\n\nPositions: head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (2,4)  // old tail (1,4) vacated\n\n(2,4) is tail now.\n\nThen on turn 43, from (4,5) dir L, possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), but not R.\n\n(4,4) is body, seg7? Positions: seg7 is (4,4), body, so D to (4,4) collision.\n\nU to (4,6), free.\n\nL to (3,5), free.\n\nR to (5,5) body and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), then head to (3,5), no food, new positions: head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), etc., down to seg9 (3,4)  // old tail (2,4) vacated, and food at (2,4) is now free.\n\nBut head at (3,5), so I can move to (2,5) or (3,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) is body.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (2,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) is wall, or (3,4) or (4,5) body.\n\n(3,4) is body, seg9 in new positions? After move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (3,4)  // old seg9 (2,4) vacated\n\nSo (3,4) is now tail, and (3,4) is occupied, but food is at (2,4), free.\n\nFrom head (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) but (3,6) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is tail, so moving there is ok, because tail will move, but (3,4) has no food, so I move to (3,4), no eat, so new head (3,4), and tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut I want to eat the food at (2,4).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), then to (2,4) next turn.\n\nMove L to (2,5): (2,5) free? Not wall, not snake, free.\n\nThen head to (2,5), dir L.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move D to (2,4) to eat the food, since (2,4) is free and has food.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 41, I must move U to (5,5).\n\nTurn 41 action: U\n\nThen turn 42, head at (5,5), dir U.\n\nI can choose to move L to (4,5) to go towards the left.\n\nSo action turn 42: L\n\nThen snake positions: head (4,5), dir L, body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)  // tail at (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is tail, and food is there, but under body, so I cannot eat it yet because the body is on it. I need to move so that the tail moves away, freeing the cell, then head can move to it.\n\nOn turn 43, from (4,5) dir L, I move L to (3,5), as above.\n\nAction turn 43: L to (3,5)\n\nPositions: head (3,5), dir L, body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)  // tail at (3,4), (2,4) free with food.\n\nNow head at (3,5), I can move to (2,5) or (3,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) body.\n\nMove to (2,5): L, since dir L, L is allowed.\n\nAction turn 44: L to (2,5)\n\nNow head at (2,5), dir L.\n\nFood at (2,4) is below, at (2,4).\n\nI can move D to (2,4) to eat it.\n\nBut is there Tail Reward Danger? Head at (2,5), tail at (3,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a cell or adjacent cells? Collision if head touches body, but adjacent cells are not touch, only if same cell.\n\n\"head touches any body segment\" means same cell.\n\nSo head at (2,5), tail at (3,4), not same cell, not adjacent in the sense of collision.\n\nCells adjacent if |dx|<=1 and |dy|<=1 and not same.\n\nBut for collision, only when head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n\nFor Tail Reward Danger, \"if head is adjacent to tail\" meaning neighboring cells, and tail cell has food.\n\nIn this case, head at (2,5), tail at (3,4), are they adjacent? (2,5) and (3,4): dx=1, dy=-1, so diagonal, which is adjacent if we consider 8-direction, but in Snake, movement is 4-direction, so adjacent usually means orthogonal, not diagonal.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but in context, \"adjacent\" probably means orthogonal neighbors, since movement is U/D/L/R.\n\nCheck: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail\" – in grid terms, adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(2,5) and (3,4) are not orthogonal adjacent; (2,5) neighbors: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5). (3,4) is not a neighbor; it's diagonal.\n\nSo not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, on turn 45, from (2,5) dir L, I can move D to (2,4) to eat the food.\n\nAction turn 45: D to (2,4)\n\nThen I eat the food at (2,4), snake grows.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nTurn 41: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 43: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (2,4) eat food.\n\nNow, during this, what about the other food?\n\n(6,5) food: on turn 42, if I didn't eat it, life span decreases. On turn 42, it was available, but I moved away, so not eaten. It disappears after turn 44, so on turn 45 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is still there, life span 6 on turn 41, so on turn 45, life span 2 or something.\n\nTurn 41: (1,6) life span 6\n\nTurn 42: 5\n\nTurn 43: 4\n\nTurn 44: 3\n\nTurn 45: 2, still available.\n\nAfter eating at (2,4) on turn 45, I can go to (1,6).\n\nBut is this safe? Let's see the position after turn 44.\n\nOn turn 44, after moving to (2,5), positions: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 41: snake [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] but after turn 41 move, tail was at (1,4), but we vacated (1,4) when moving.\n\nTurn 41 action U to (5,5): positions [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]? No, earlier: after turn 41 move, we have [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] and (1,5) was vacated.\n\nIn the list, positions include (1,4) as tail.\n\nTurn 42 move L to (4,5): new head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (2,4)  // old tail (1,4) vacated\n\nSo positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 43 move L to (3,5): new head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (3,4)  // old seg9 (2,4) vacated, but food is there.\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nTurn 44 move L to (2,5): new head (2,5), dir L, seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,4)  // old seg9 (3,4) vacated? Old positions had seg9 (3,4), so after move, new seg9 is old seg8 (4,4)? Let's index.\n\nOld positions turn 43: index 0: (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,5) no eat: new head (2,5), new seg1: old0 (3,5), new seg2: old1 (4,5), new seg3: old2 (5,5), new seg4: old3 (5,4), new seg5: old4 (6,4), new seg6: old5 (6,3), new seg7: old6 (5,3), new seg8: old7 (4,3), new seg9: old8 (4,4)  // old9 (3,4) vacated\n\nSo positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is free.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nHead at (2,5), move D to (2,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,4), then previous positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) and since food eaten, add new segment, so tail is (4,4), and we add a new segment there? No.\n\nAfter eating: new head at food cell (2,4), then the entire previous snake: so (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) as segments 1 to 10, and new tail at (4,4).\n\nPositions: head (2,4), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (4,3), seg10 (4,4)\n\nLength 11.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, I can go to (1,6) from here.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), adjacent to head (2,4)? (2,4) to (1,6) not directly, but I can move to (1,4) or (2,3), etc.\n\nHead at (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) but (2,5) is seg1, body, collision.\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) free? Not wall, not snake, y=3>0, x=2>0, no wall, free.\n\nL to (1,4): (1,4) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (3,4): but (3,4) is not in positions, but (3,4) might be free or not. In positions, we have seg10 at (4,4), etc., (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut walls, (3,4) is not wall.\n\nNow, to go to (1,6), from (2,4), I can move L to (1,4), then U to (1,5), then U to (1,6).\n\n(1,5) was vacated earlier, should be free.\n\n(1,6) has food.\n\nLife span: on turn 45, (1,6) life span: started turn 41 with 6, so turn 45: after 4 turns, life span 2? Turn 41:6, turn42:5, turn43:4, turn44:3, turn45:2, so available.\n\nI can eat it on turn 46 or 47.\n\nBut let's see if this sequence is good.\n\nI also have the option to eat (6,5) earlier, but it expires soon.\n\nOn turn 42, if I move R to (6,5) to eat it, then I go to (6,6) and so on, but I might be stuck in the corner.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), I had to move L to (5,6), then I can go down or left, but the snake body is below, so I might have limited space.\n\nWhereas going left, I can eat the food at (2,4) and then (1,6), and have more space.\n\nMoreover, (2,4) food might be easier to get since it's closer in path.\n\nIn terms of score, both are +1, so eating either is fine, but (6,5) expires in 3 turns, while (1,6) in more, but since I can get both, better to get the one that doesn't risk trapping.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (3,6) might block, but in the left area, it's ok.\n\nAnother thing: after eating at (2,4), I am at (2,4), and I can go to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6) to eat.\n\n(1,5) was tail earlier, but now should be free.\n\nFrom head (2,4) after eating, on turn 46, I can move L to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free, no food, so move there.\n\nThen to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, not border, so ok.\n\nNow, about the answer: I need to output actions starting from turn 41.\n\nFor turn 41, I must move U.\n\nThen for turn 42, I can choose to move L towards the left to get the other food.\n\nIn the sequence above, I moved L on turn 42.\n\nBut on turn 42, I could move U to (5,6) or something.\n\nBut moving L seems better to reach (2,4) food.\n\nI could consider going directly to (1,6).\n\nFor example, from turn 42 head at (5,5), move L to (4,5), then turn 43 move U to (4,6), then turn 44 move L to (3,6), but (3,6) is wall, invalid.\n\n(4,6) to (3,6) not possible.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move to (4,7) but y=7 wall, or (5,6), or (3,6) wall, or (4,5) body.\n\nAfter turn 42 move L to (4,5), positions as before.\n\nThen turn 43, from (4,5) dir L, I can move U to (4,6).\n\nThen head to (4,6), dir U.\n\nPositions: head (4,6), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), etc., down to seg9 (2,4) // old tail (2,4)? After turn 42: positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move U to (4,6): new head (4,6), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (3,4)  // old seg9 (2,4) vacated\n\n(2,4) free with food.\n\nNow head at (4,6), I can move to (3,6) but wall, or (4,7) wall, or (5,6), or (4,5) body.\n\nSo only (5,6) possible? Move R to (5,6).\n\nThen to (6,6), etc., not towards (2,4).\n\nTo reach (1,6), from (4,6), I can only go to (5,6), then to (6,6), away.\n\nFrom (4,6), I could have moved to (4,5) but body.\n\nNo, so it's hard to reach (1,6) directly from here; better to go down first.\n\nBut with the previous plan, I can eat (2,4) then go to (1,6).\n\nIn the first plan, after eating (2,4) at (2,4), I can move L to (1,4) on turn 46, then U to (1,5) on turn 47, then U to (1,6) on turn 48 to eat.\n\n(1,6) life span on turn 48: turn41:6, turn42:5, turn43:4, turn44:3, turn45:2, turn46:1, turn47:0? Life span decreases each turn including current.\n\nOn turn 41: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 41: decrease to 5 for turn 42\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 46: life span 0?

Previous positions: head (2,4), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (3,5), ..., seg10 (4,4)\n\nAfter move L to (1,4) no eat: new head (1,4), new seg1: old head (2,4), new seg2: old seg1 (2,5), new seg3: old seg2 (3,5), ..., up to new seg10: old seg9 (4,3), and old seg10 (4,4) vacated?

(1,5) may have been vacated earlier, but no food there, so move.\n\nThen positions: head (1,5), etc.\n\nThen turn 48, move U to (1,6): but on turn 48, (1,6) food is gone, since after turn 46 life span 0, not present on turn 47 and later.\n\nTurn 46: (1,6) life span 1, present\n\nAfter turn 46: life span 0, disappears, so not on turn 47.\n\nOn turn 47, if I move to (1,6), it might not have food.\n\nBut (1,6) is a cell, if no food, I just move there.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be there when food is present.\n\nLast chance to eat is turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, head at (1,4), I can move directly to (1,6)? No, only one step.\n\nI can only move to (1,5) or other.\n\nFrom (1,4), move U to (1,5) on turn 46.\n\nThen (1,5) no food, so move.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6).\n\nBut on turn 47, (1,6) is not present, so no eat, just move.\n\nBut I missed the food.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to be at (1,6) on or before turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, if I can be at (1,6).\n\nBut from where?\n\nFor example, on turn 45, after eating at (2,4), head at (2,4).\n\nOn turn 46, I can move to (1,4) or (2,3), not directly to (1,6).\n\nThe only way is to be at (1,5) on turn 45 or something.\n\nBut on turn 45, I am at (2,4), not at (1,5).\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize (1,6) earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 42, from (5,5), instead of moving L, move U to (5,6).\n\nThen head to (5,6), dir U.\n\nThen turn 43, from (5,6) dir U, I can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), since U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body.\n\nSay move L to (4,6).\n\nThen to (4,6), dir L.\n\nThen turn 44, from (4,6) dir L, I can move L to (3,6) but wall, or D to (4,5), or U to (4,7) wall, or R to (5,6) body.\n\nSo only D to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) may be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 42 move U to (5,6): positions from turn 41: after turn 41 move U, positions [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nAfter move U to (5,6): new head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (2,4)  // old tail (1,4) vacated\n\nTurn 43 move L to (4,6): new head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (3,4)  // old seg9 (2,4) vacated\n\n(2,4) free with food.\n\nTurn 44 move D to (4,5): new head (4,5), dir D, seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,4)  // old seg9 (3,4) vacated\n\nNow head at (4,5), I can move to (4,4) but (4,4) is seg9, tail? In positions, seg9 is (4,4), which is tail, so moving to (4,4) is ok, no collision.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nOr move to (3,5) or (5,5) or (4,6) body.\n\n(3,5) free, (5,5) is seg3, body.\n\nSo I can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4) to tail.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), from (4,5), it's far.\n\nOn turn 45, from (4,5), move L to (3,5), then to (2,5), etc., same as before.\n\nBut to get to (1,6) by turn 46, I need to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 42, from (5,5), move directly to the left, but (1,6) is at top left.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5), then U to (4,6) on turn 43, but from (4,6), I can only move down to (4,5) or right to (5,6), not left because wall.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) from there in one step.\n\nThe only way is to be at (1,5) or (2,6) on turn 45 to reach (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nBut (2,6) might be free.\n\nPerhaps I should forget (1,6) and focus on (2,4) and the other food.\n\n(6,5) is expiring soon.\n\nOn turn 42, if I eat (6,5), I can get it, but then I might not get (2,4) easily.\n\nSince (2,4) is under body, I need to free it, which takes a few turns.\n\nIn the first plan, I can eat (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nAnd (1,6) I can try to eat but it might expire.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 46, I can be at (1,4), and (1,6) is gone.\n\nSo I should output the actions for turns 41 to 45 or so.\n\nFor turn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 43: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 44: L (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 45: D (to (2,4) eat)\n\nThen for later turns, I can move to (1,4) or other.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince the food at (1,6) is hard to get in time, I might skip it.\n\nAnother food? Only three, and (6,5) will be gone.\n\nSo in this case, eating (2,4) is good.\n\nOn turn 42, if I move R to (6,5), I eat it immediately, but then I am at (6,5), and on turn 43 I must move U to (6,6), then turn 44 move L to (5,6), then from there I can go down to (5,5) but body, or to (5,7) wall, so only to (4,6) or (6,6) but (6,6) was previous, etc., I might be looping or something.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) but body, or L to (4,6), or U to (5,7) wall, or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move L to (4,6), then similar as before.\n\nBut the body is below, so space is tight.\n\nWhereas going left, after eating (2,4), I have more room to maneuever.\n\nSo I think the first plan is better.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: L\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nBut I need to specify the action for each turn, and since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide 5 actions.\n\nTurn 41 to 45.\n\nNow, on turn 45, I eat the food.\n\nThen for survival, I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=41.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: L\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nAnd for the boxed format.\n\nBut in turn 44, I moved to (2,5), which is safe, and turn 45 to (2,4) eat.\n\nAlso, no risks, and I get one food.\n\nIf I had eaten (6,5) on turn 42, I get one food but might be trapped.\n\nSo this seems good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 41 to 45, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (2,4) by freeing it from under the snake's body and then moving the head onto it, while avoiding the expiring food at (6,5) due to the risk of getting trapped in the top-right corner. The food at (1,6) is not targeted as it expires soon (after turn 46) and cannot be reached safely within the time frame without unnecessary risk.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 41 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (5,4), direction left (L).\n  - Only possible move is up (U) to (5,5) to avoid collision with body segments or walls.\n  - Moving left (L) to (4,4) causes collision with body at (4,4). Moving down (D) to (5,3) causes collision with body at (5,3). Moving right (R) is invalid (reverse direction not allowed).\n- **Food at (2,4)**:\n  - Currently under the snake's body (segment at (2,4)). To eat it, the body must move away first.\n  - By moving left repeatedly, the segment at (2,4) becomes the tail by turn 42, and moving further frees the cell by turn 43. The head can then approach and eat the food on turn 45.\n  - Life span is 9 on turn 41, so it remains available until after turn 49 (plenty of time).\n- **Food at (6,5)**:\n  - Life span 4 on turn 41, so it disappears after turn 44 (not available on turn 45). Eating it on turn 42 is possible but leads to the top-right corner, where movement options become limited (e.g., only up to (6,6) on turn 43), increasing collision risk with walls or body. Avoiding this minimizes risk.\n- **Food at (1,6)**:\n  - Life span 6 on turn 41, so it disappears after turn 46 (not available on turn 47). Reaching it by turn 46 requires moving directly left/up from turn 42, but this is infeasible due to the internal wall at (3,6) and body positions. Attempting it would waste moves and risk missing the (2,4) food.\n- **Movement Safety**:\n  - All moves avoid walls (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (3,6)) and body collisions.\n  - No instant reverse direction is violated.\n  - After eating at (2,4) on turn 45, the snake has room to maneuver safely in the left area.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 41-45):\n- **Turn 41**: Move U (up) to (5,5). This is the only safe move from (5,4) with direction L. No food eaten; snake length unchanged. New head direction: U.\n- **Turn 42**: Move L (left) to (4,5). From (5,5) with direction U, moving L is safe and starts the path toward (2,4). No food eaten; snake length unchanged. New head direction: L.\n- **Turn 43**: Move L (left) to (3,5). From (4,5) with direction L, moving L is safe and continues the path. The body segment at (2,4) moves away, freeing the cell with food. No food eaten; snake length unchanged. New head direction: L.\n- **Turn 44**: Move L (left) to (2,5). From (3,5) with direction L, moving L is safe. Cell (2,4) is now free with food, and head is adjacent at (2,5). No food eaten; snake length unchanged. New head direction: L.\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (2,4). From (2,5) with direction L, moving D to (2,4) eats the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases by 1). No tail reward danger (head at (2,5) not adjacent to tail at (4,4) orthogonally). New head direction: D.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 45, the snake eats the food at (2,4), increasing the score by 1 and length by 1.\n- The sequence avoids risks: no wall collisions, no body collisions (tail movement is handled safely), and no tight spaces.\n- After turn 45, the snake can explore the left area (e.g., move to (1,4) or (2,3)) for potential future food, but this is beyond the 5-turn plan.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: L \\\\\nTurn 44: L \\\\\nTurn 45: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 42. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). Head direction is U (up), which means it was moving up to get to (5,5) from (5,4)? Let's list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 8: (2,4)\n\n- Tail: (1,4)\n\nThe head is at (5,5), and it moved up to get there since the previous position was (5,4), which is below it. So current direction is U.\n\nFood items:\n\n1. (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n\n2. (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n3. (2,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, (2,4) is a food position, but looking at snake positions, (2,4) is also a body segment. Specifically, it's the 9th segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: (5,4), index 2: (6,4), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (4,4), index 7: (3,4), index 8: (2,4), index 9: (1,4). So (2,4) is the 8th segment in the list, but it's not the tail; tail is (1,4).\n\nThe food at (2,4) is on a body segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n\nAlso, life spans: food at (6,5) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. So after turn 44, it will be gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 42, life span 3: so it will be available on turns 42, 43, 44, and disappear after turn 44, so not available on turn 45.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 5: available turns 42 to 46, disappear after 46.\n\n(2,4) life span 8: available turns 42 to 49.\n\nBut (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. The snake needs to move so that the body leaves (2,4), and then later the head can move to it if food is still there.\n\nI need to plan moves for the next 5+ turns to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Walls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to6, but (3,6) is obstacle, so not passable.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), direction U (up). Possible moves: since direction is U, I can go U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, so from U, I cannot go D. Allowed moves: U, L, R.\n\nSimilarly, from other directions, can't go opposite.\n\nSo at (5,5), current dir U, possible actions: U (to (5,6)), L (to (4,5)), R (to (6,5)).\n\nR to (6,5) is where food is, with life span 3.\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to head, and it has food.\n\nBut let's check if moving there is safe.\n\nFirst, what happens if I move to (6,5)? That's the food position.\n\nIf head moves to (6,5), it eats the food, since it's positive, snake length increases by one, so a new segment is added. Normally, when snake moves, the head goes to new position, and tail is removed, but when eating, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n\nHere, since it eats food, after moving to (6,5), the new head position is (6,5), and the previous head (5,5) becomes body, and since food eaten, no tail removed, so snake grows.\n\nCurrent positions: before move: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] — that's 10 segments? Let's count: indices 0 to 9, 10 positions.\n\nAfter moving R to (6,5):\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Then body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) — and since food eaten, no tail removed, so new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] — 11 segments, tail still (1,4) for now, but when snake moves next, if no food, tail moves.\n\nBut for collision check, after move, head is at (6,5), which was food, so no issue. Now, is there collision? Body segments: (5,5) is adjacent, but that's the first body segment, which is fine, as long as not the same cell. Head at (6,5), body at (5,5), different cells. Other segments: (5,4), etc., none at (6,5) except the food, which is eaten.\n\nAlso, walls: (6,5) is within bounds, x=6, y=5, x from 1-6, y=5 from 1-6, yes, not wall. (3,6) is obstacle but not here.\n\nSo moving to (6,5) seems safe and gets +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Food at (6,5) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after turn 44. Since current turn 42, it will be gone after turn 44, so if not eaten by turn 44, it vanishes.\n\nTurn 42: available, if eaten on turn 42, it's gone.\n\nIf not eaten on 42, it stays for 43 and 44, gone on 45.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, other moves: U to (5,6) or L to (4,5).\n\n(5,6): what is there? No food mentioned, so empty? Or could there be other things? Only the given food, so (5,6) is empty.\n\n(4,5) empty.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should consider the options for turn 42.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,5) — eat food, get +1, snake grows.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen for next turn, possible moves from there.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (5,6)\n\nOption 3: Move L to (4,5)\n\nNow, also, there is food at (1,6) and (2,4), but (2,4) is currently occupied by snake body, so can't eat now.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is within bounds? x=1, y=6, walls at x=0 and y=7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is ok, not wall. x=1 ok.\n\nBut it's far away.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is body, but if snake moves, the body might move away.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (1,4), and food at (2,4) is on a body segment, not tail. Tail is (1,4), no food there.\n\nFood at (2,4) is on segment (2,4), which is not tail; tail is (1,4).\n\nSo no issue with tail reward danger at the moment.\n\nNow, back to turn 42 choices.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I eat the food, get +1, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nNow, for turn 43, from (6,5), direction R, so possible moves: R (to (7,5)? But x=7 is wall, so cannot move R, wall collision.\n\nU (to (6,6)), D (to (6,4)), or L (to (5,5)).\n\nBut L would be opposite to current direction R? Current direction after moving R is R, so moving L would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nRule: no instant reverse, so from direction R, cannot move L.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, or R, but R to (7,5) is wall, so invalid. Only U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nNow, (6,6): is it safe? y=6, within 1-6, x=6 ok. But is it occupied? Current positions after move: head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (5,4), etc. (6,6) is empty? No snake there yet.\n\nBut let's list positions after turn 42 if moved R:\n\nSnake: head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\n(6,4) is a body segment.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6) on turn 43, that should be fine, no collision.\n\nIf move D to (6,4), but (6,4) is a body segment! (6,4) is the fourth segment in the list, so moving to (6,4) would cause head to collide with body, death.\n\nSo from (6,5), moving D to (6,4) is suicide, not possible.\n\nOnly possible move is U to (6,6).\n\nThen direction U.\n\nAfter moving U to (6,6), head at (6,6), no food there, so snake moves, tail removed? Since no food eaten.\n\nAfter turn 42, if we ate food, no tail removal on that move. On turn 43, if no food, tail is removed.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 42: move R to (6,5), eat food, so new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] — 11 segments, tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 43: move U to (6,6). Since no food at (6,6), head moves to (6,6), tail is removed, so tail (1,4) removed, new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail now (2,4), which had food, but since not eaten, food still there? Food at (2,4) is on the cell, but snake was on it, but after tail moves away, food might be accessible.\n\nWhen tail moves away from (2,4), the cell is free, and food is still there with remaining life.\n\nAfter turn 43 move, positions: head (6,6), body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), etc., down to (2,4) as tail.\n\n(2,4) is now the tail position.\n\nBut food at (2,4) is still present, I think, since it wasn't eaten.\n\nThe food is on the cell, and when snake moves away, it becomes accessible.\n\nBut for eating, head needs to move to it when it's free.\n\nNow, from (6,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves for turn 44: from U, can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (6,7)? y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,6), or R to (7,6)? x=7 wall, invalid. So only L to (5,6).\n\nMove L to (5,6).\n\nNo food, so head to (5,6), tail removed. Tail is (2,4), so removed, and (3,4) becomes new tail? Positions: before move: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move to (5,6): new head (5,6), then body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) — and tail (2,4) removed, so positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — 11 segments? After growth to 11, then on turn 43 no eat, so back to 10 segments? Let's track length.\n\nStart: turn 42, before move, snake has 10 segments.\n\nMove to (6,5) and eat, so after turn 42, 11 segments.\n\nTurn 43: move to (6,6), no food, so after move, head new, tail removed, so 10 segments.\n\nTurn 44: move to (5,6), no food, so after move, 9 segments? Positions: from turn 43 end: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — 10 segments, tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,6): head (5,6), then body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and tail (3,4) removed, so 10 segments? List: indices: 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4) — that's 10 positions, tail is (4,4).\n\n(3,4) was removed.\n\nFood at (2,4) is still there, but not eaten.\n\nNow, we are at (5,6), direction L (since moved left from (6,6) to (5,6), so dir L).\n\nPossible moves: from L, can go L, U, D, not R (instant reverse).\n\nL to (4,6), U to (5,7)? y=7 wall, invalid, D to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is a body segment! In current positions, (5,5) is segment 3, so moving to (5,5) would cause collision.\n\nL to (4,6): is it free? Probably, but let's see.\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6, within bounds, not wall except (3,6) obstacle, but (4,6) is different.\n\nNo food mentioned, so empty.\n\nSo move L to (4,6) possible.\n\nBut we need to think about other food.\n\nIn this path, by moving R on turn 42, we ate the (6,5) food, but then we are stuck in the top-right corner, and from (5,6), we can only move to (4,6) or (5,5), but (5,5) is body, so only (4,6).\n\nThen from there, etc., but it might be risky or not efficient for other food.\n\nPerhaps not moving to (6,5) immediately is better for long-term.\n\nLet's consider other options for turn 42.\n\nOption: move U to (5,6)\n\nFrom (5,5), current dir U, move U to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is empty, no food.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,6), no food, so tail removed. Tail is (1,4), so removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail (2,4), which has food.\n\nBut food at (2,4) is on tail now? Tail is (2,4), and it has food, but not eaten yet.\n\nHead at (5,6), far from tail.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen for turn 43, from (5,6), dir U, possible moves: U to (5,7)? wall, invalid; L to (4,6), R to (6,6), D to (5,5) but D is opposite to U, instant reverse not allowed, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) or (6,6), both empty probably.\n\nSay move R to (6,6).\n\nThen head to (6,6), no food, tail removed. Tail was (2,4), so removed, new tail (3,4) or something.\n\nPositions before move: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)]\n\nAfter move to (6,6): head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (2,4) removed, so [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — tail (3,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nBut head is at (6,6), far away.\n\nFood at (6,5) is still there, life span 3, at turn 43, life span decreases to 2, so available for 43 and 44.\n\nFrom (6,6), dir R? After moving to (6,6) from (5,6) by moving right, so direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: R to (7,6) wall, invalid; U to (6,7) wall invalid; D to (6,5), or L to (5,6) but L is opposite to R, not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food, which is still there.\n\nMove D to (6,5), eat food, get +1, snake grows.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen similar to before, but now we have eaten the food later.\n\nBut in this case, by not eating on turn 42, we can still eat on turn 43 or 44.\n\nBut we need to consider the (2,4) food.\n\nAnother option for turn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nFrom (5,5), dir U, move L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) empty, no food.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,5), no food, tail removed (1,4), new positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail (2,4) with food.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen for turn 43, from (4,5), dir L, possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), not R (opposite).\n\nNow, (4,4) is a body segment! In positions, (4,4) is segment 7 or something, let's see: positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n\n(4,4) is segment 7, so moving to (4,4) would collide.\n\nL to (3,5): (3,5) is empty? Probably, not wall, not food, not snake? Snake at (3,4) and (4,4), etc., but (3,5) free.\n\nU to (4,6) free.\n\nD to (4,4) not possible.\n\nSo move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nSay move to (3,5).\n\nThen head to (3,5), no food, tail removed (2,4)? Tail is (2,4), removed, and food at (2,4) is now free.\n\nPositions after move: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (2,4) removed, so [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — tail (3,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) free.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4), not R.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is body segment, tail or not? Positions: (3,4) is segment 9, tail, so moving to (3,4) would cause head to collide with tail? But when head moves to tail, since tail will move, it might be ok, but in this case, since no food eaten, tail will move, so head can move to the current tail position because the tail will leave that cell.\n\nRule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nSo it should be safe, as long as after move, it's not colliding with other body.\n\nHere, if move D to (3,4), head to (3,4), which is current tail, and since no food, tail will be removed, so the new positions will not have (3,4) as body, so no collision.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), new head (3,4), then body (3,5), (4,5), etc., and tail removed, so no issue.\n\n(3,4) has food? Food at (2,4), not (3,4). (3,4) is empty, no food mentioned.\n\nFood is at (2,4), (1,6), (6,5).\n\n(3,4) no food.\n\nSo moving to (3,4) is safe, but no food.\n\nL to (2,5) or U to (3,6) invalid, so only L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is free, I think.\n\nBut we have food at (2,4) nearby.\n\nLife span of (2,4) is 8, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) with life 5.\n\nNow, back to turn 42 decision.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eating the (6,5) food is good, but it has short life span, only 3 turns, so if not eaten soon, it vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has life 5, (2,4) has 8.\n\nBut (2,4) is currently under snake, so we need to move the snake to free it.\n\nThe tail is at (1,4), and (2,4) is the segment before tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail will move away from (1,4) if no growth.\n\nIn current state, tail is at (1,4), and (2,4) has food.\n\nIf we don't eat food, the tail will eventually move, freeing (2,4) for eating later.\n\nFor example, on turn 42, if we move in a way that tail moves, (2,4) becomes free.\n\nThen we can go back to eat it.\n\nBut it's at (2,4), which is near the left side.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is at top-left.\n\n(6,5) is top-right.\n\nSnake head is at (5,5), center-top.\n\nTo prioritize long-term, perhaps we should eat (6,5) soon since it will disappear, and then go for other food.\n\nBut eating (6,5) on turn 42 might trap us in the corner.\n\nIf we eat it on turn 43 or 44, it's still possible.\n\nFor example, from turn 42, move U to (5,6), then on turn 43 move to (6,6) or (4,6), then to (6,5) if possible.\n\nLet's list all food and their deadlines:\n\n- (6,5): available until turn 44 (disappears after 44)\n\n- (1,6): available until turn 46 (life 5, from 42 to 46)\n\n- (2,4): available until turn 49 (life 8, 42 to 49)\n\nSo (6,5) must be eaten by turn 44.\n\n(1,6) by turn 46.\n\n(2,4) by turn 49.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), so (6,5) is adjacent, can be eaten on turn 42 or later if we go there.\n\nBut if not eaten on 42, we need to be able to reach it on 43 or 44.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) blocks access to (1,6) from certain directions.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), (3,6) is blocked, so to go from right to left at y=6, we have to go below or above, but y=6 is top, so below.\n\ny=6 is the row below y=7 wall.\n\nGrid y from 1 to 6, y=1 bottom, y=6 top? In coordinates, usually y=0 bottom or top? But here walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6, with y=1 being bottom, y=6 top, I think, since moving U increases y.\n\nIn the state, snake head direction U, from (5,4) to (5,5), so y increased, so y=5 to y=6 is up, so y=6 is top row.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\n(1,6) top-left, (6,5) top-right, (2,4) left-middle.\n\nSnake is long, 10 segments, so it occupies many cells.\n\nTo avoid starvation, we need to have space to move.\n\nAfter eating (6,5), we might be cramped in corner.\n\nBut we can go down.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps avoid eating (6,5) now and go for the (2,4) food after freeing it.\n\nBut (2,4) has long life, while (6,5) will vanish soon.\n\nSo better to eat (6,5) first.\n\nBut let's see if we can eat both.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nThen as above, we can move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), dir L, move U to (4,6) for example.\n\n(4,6) empty.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,6), no food, tail removed, new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — tail (2,4) removed, so food at (2,4) free now.\n\nDirection U (since moved up).\n\nThen for turn 43, from (4,6), dir U, possible moves: U to (4,7) wall invalid, L to (3,6) obstacle invalid, R to (5,6), D to (4,5) but D opposite to U, not allowed.\n\nSo only R to (5,6).\n\nMove to (5,6), no food, tail removed. Tail was (3,4)? Positions before: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,6): head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail (3,4) removed, so [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] — tail (4,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 44, from (5,6), dir R, possible moves: R to (6,6), U to (5,7) wall invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6) but L opposite to R, not allowed.\n\nSo R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is body segment, in positions, (5,5) is segment 3, so moving to (5,5) collision.\n\nR to (6,6) possible.\n\nMove to (6,6), no food, tail removed. Tail (4,4) removed, new positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] — tail (4,3)? Let's list: 0:(6,6), 1:(5,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(4,5), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,4), 6:(6,4), 7:(6,3), 8:(5,3), 9:(4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 45, from (6,6), dir R, only D to (6,5), but (6,5) food is gone after turn 44, so on turn 45, no food there, and moving to (6,5) is possible, but no food.\n\nFrom (6,6), move D to (6,5), no food, tail removed, etc.\n\nBut we missed the (6,5) food because by turn 44, we didn't eat it.\n\nIn this path, on turn 42 we moved L, then on 43 to (4,6), 44 to (5,6), 45 to (6,6), so by turn 44, head is at (5,6) or (6,6), not at (6,5), so (6,5) not eaten and vanishes after 44.\n\nSo we lost that food.\n\nIf on turn 42 we move U to (5,6), then on turn 43 we can move to (6,6) or (4,6).\n\nIf move to (6,6), then turn 44 move D to (6,5) to eat, if done on turn 44.\n\nTurn 42: move U to (5,6), no eat, tail removed, positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] — tail (2,4) with food, but not eaten.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 43: move R to (6,6), no food, tail removed, positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] — tail (2,4) removed, food at (2,4) free.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 44: from (6,6), dir R, only D to (6,5) possible, and (6,5) food is still available on turn 44, so move D to (6,5), eat food, get +1.\n\nSo we eat it on turn 44, just in time.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 43 from (5,6) we move L to (4,6), then on turn 44 from (4,6) we can only move R to (5,6), then on turn 45 to (6,6) or something, but (6,5) gone, so miss the food.\n\nSo to eat (6,5), we need to be at (6,6) or (5,5) or (6,4) on turn 43 or 44 to move to it.\n\nFrom (5,5) or (6,4) we can move to (6,5) if adjacent.\n\nOn turn 44, if head at (6,6), we can move D to (6,5).\n\nIf head at (5,5), we can move R to (6,5).\n\nBut (5,5) might be occupied.\n\nIn the U then R path, we can eat on turn 44.\n\nNow, for the other food, (1,6) and (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is now free after tail moved.\n\nIn the above, after turn 43, (2,4) is free.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), we need to go there.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently no such situation.\n\nNow, to maximize score, we should eat all food if possible.\n\nBut with the snake length, space might be limited.\n\nAnother option: on turn 42, move to (4,5) by L, then we can go down to eat (2,4) later.\n\nBut (2,4) has long life, so lower priority than (6,5) which is urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life 5, also need to eat soon.\n\nTurn 42 to 46 for (1,6).\n\nFrom current position, to reach (1,6), it might take a few moves.\n\nHead at (5,5), (1,6) is at (1,6), so Manhattan distance |5-1| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5, so at least 5 moves away, but with the body, it might take more to maneuver.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is at (2,4), distance |5-2| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4, but it was under snake, now free or soon free.\n\nBut since (6,5) is very close, it's efficient to eat it.\n\nMoreover, not eating it risks missing it if something goes wrong.\n\nSo probably best to eat (6,5) on turn 42 or soon.\n\nBut on turn 42, if we eat it, we are at (6,5) with direction R, then only can move U to (6,6) on turn 43, then on turn 44 only L to (5,6), then from (5,6) we can move L to (4,6) or D to (5,5), but (5,5) may be body.\n\nAfter eating on turn 42:\n\nTurn 42: move R to (6,5), eat, positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)] 11 segments\n\nTurn 43: move U to (6,6), no food, tail removed (1,4), positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] 10 segments, tail (2,4) removed, food at (2,4) free.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 44: from (6,6), dir U, only L to (5,6), move to (5,6), no food, tail removed (2,4) already, tail is now (3,4)?

No, after turn 44 we had 10 segments.\n\nTurn 44 end: 10 segments.\n\nTurn 45: move to (4,6), no food, so tail removed, 9 segments: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] tail (4,3)? Let's list: 0:(4,6), 1:(5,6), 2:(6,6), 3:(6,5), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,4), 6:(6,4), 7:(6,3), 8:(5,3), and tail removed was (4,4), so positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] — 9 segments, tail (5,3)\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nFrom (4,6), dir L (since moved left to (4,6) from (5,6)? From (5,6) to (4,6) is left, so direction L.\n\nTurn 46: from (4,6), dir L, moves: L to (3,6) obstacle invalid, U invalid, D to (4,5), not R.\n\nSo only D to (4,5).\n\nMove to (4,5), no food, tail removed, etc.\n\n(4,5) is free, move to it.\n\nThen from there, we can go to (3,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), we need to go left and up, but (3,6) blocked, so we have to go down to y=5 or less, then left to x=1, then up to y=6.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), to (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5), then (1,6).\n\nBut on turn 46, we are at (4,5), and (1,6) must be eaten by turn 46, so on turn 46, head at (4,5), to (1,6) is 3 moves away: e.g., (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), then (1,6), but from (1,5) to (1,6) is up.\n\nBut turn 46 is the last turn for (1,6), so if head not at (1,6) on turn 46, it can't eat.\n\nAt turn 46, if head moves to (1,6), it can eat.\n\nBut from (4,5) on turn 46, we can move to (3,5) or (4,4) or (4,6), but not directly to (1,6).\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,6) by turn 46 from here.\n\nSimilarly, in other paths, it might be tight.\n\nBut if we eat (6,5) later, we might have time.\n\nFor example, on turn 42, move U to (5,6), then turn 43 move to (6,6), then turn 44 move D to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nNow, on turn 45, from (6,5), dir D, possible moves: D to (6,4), L to (5,5), U to (6,6), not R (instant reverse).\n\n(6,4) is body segment? Positions after turn 44 eat: after moving to (6,5) and eat on turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: move to (6,5) and eat, so from previous, on turn 43, if we were at (6,6), positions before turn 44 move: after turn 43, we have positions from earlier.\n\nAssume turn 42: move U to (5,6), no eat, positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 43: move R to (6,6), no eat, tail removed, positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] tail (2,4) removed, food at (2,4) free.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 44: move D to (6,5), eat food, so new positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] 11 segments, tail (3,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 45: from (6,5), dir D, moves: D to (6,4), L to (5,5), U to (6,6), not R.\n\n(6,4) is body segment (segment 5), so collision if move there.\n\nU to (6,6) is body segment (segment 1), also collision.\n\nL to (5,5) is body segment (segment 3), collision.\n\nAll possible moves lead to body collision! Because the snake is coiled around.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n\nSo adjacent cells: (6,4) down: occupied by body\n\n(6,6) up: occupied by body\n\n(5,5) left: occupied by body\n\nAll three directions are occupied, so no move possible, death on turn 45.\n\nOh no! So if we eat on turn 44, we trap ourselves.\n\nWhereas if we eat on turn 42, we had a move to (6,6) on turn 43, which was safe.\n\nIn the turn 42 eat case, after eating on 42, we moved to (6,6) on 43, which was free, then to (5,6) on 44, etc., no immediate death.\n\nBut in that case, we couldn't reach (1,6) in time.\n\nNow, for (1,6), we need to eat by turn 46.\n\nCurrent turn 42.\n\nHead at (5,5).\n\nIf we don't eat (6,5), we can go left and down to free (2,4) and eat it, then go to (1,6).\n\nFor example, turn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 43: move to (3,5) or (4,6)\n\nSay move to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 44: from (3,5), can move to (2,5) or (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is body or not.\n\nAfter turn 42 move L to (4,5): positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] tail (2,4) with food.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 43: move L to (3,5), no food, tail removed, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] tail (2,4) removed, food at (2,4) free.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 44: from (3,5), dir L, moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6) obstacle invalid, D to (3,4), not R.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is tail? Positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) — (3,4) is tail.\n\nMove to (3,4): since it's tail, and no food, it should be safe, head moves to (3,4), tail removed, so no collision.\n\nBut (3,4) has no food, so no eat.\n\nMove L to (2,5), which is free.\n\nThen from (2,5), we can move to (2,4) to eat the food on turn 45 or later.\n\nBut (2,4) food is available, and life long.\n\nFor (1,6), from (2,5) or (3,5), we can go to (2,6), then (1,6).\n\nBut (2,6) may be available.\n\nFirst, on turn 44, from (3,5), let's move to (2,5) to be closer.\n\nMove L to (2,5), no food, positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (3,4) removed, so tail is (4,4)? Positions: 0:(2,5), 1:(3,5), 2:(4,5), 3:(5,5), 4:(5,4), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,3), 7:(5,3), 8:(4,3), 9:(4,4) — tail (4,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 45: from (2,5), dir L, moves: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4), not R.\n\n(2,4) has food, so move D to (2,4) to eat.\n\nEat food, get +1, snake grows.\n\nHead to (2,4), direction D.\n\nPositions: new head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — 11 segments.\n\nThen turn 46: from (2,4), dir D, moves: D to (2,3), L to (1,4), U to (2,5), not R.\n\n(2,5) is body segment (segment 1), so collision if move U.\n\nL to (1,4): (1,4) is within bounds, x=1,y=4, not wall, and not occupied? In positions, (1,4) is not there, so free.\n\nD to (2,3) free.\n\nU to (2,5) not possible.\n\nSo move L to (1,4) or D to (2,3).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so to reach it, from (1,4) we can move up to (1,5), then (1,6).\n\nOn turn 46, from (2,4), we can move U to (2,5) but collision, or L to (1,4), then on turn 47 to (1,5), turn 48 to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) must be eaten by turn 46, so on turn 46, if head not at (1,6), it can't be eaten, and it disappears after turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, head is at (2,4), can move to (1,4) or (2,3), not to (1,6) directly, so impossible to eat (1,6) on or before turn 46 from here.\n\nIf on turn 45 we move U to (2,6) instead of eating (2,4).\n\nBut (2,6) may be free.\n\nTurn 45 from (2,5), move U to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) empty, no food.\n\nPositions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), etc., tail removed, positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,4) removed, so tail (4,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 46: from (2,6), dir U, moves: U to (2,7) wall invalid, L to (1,6), R to (3,6) obstacle invalid, D to (2,5) but D opposite to U, not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (1,6).\n\nMove to (1,6), eat food there, get +1.\n\nJust in time on turn 46.\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nAlso, we have the (2,4) food still available, life span 8, so we can eat it later.\n\nIn this case, by not eating (6,5), we can eat (1,6) and (2,4).\n\nBut we missed (6,5), which is +1, but it had to be eaten soon.\n\nIn this path, we ate (1,6) on turn 46 and can eat (2,4) later.\n\nWhereas if we ate (6,5), we might not eat the others.\n\nBut (6,5) is also +1, so same score potentially, but with risk.\n\nIn the first case, by eating (6,5) on turn 42, we got +1, but then were stuck and couldn't get to (1,6) in time.\n\nBy not eating (6,5), we can get (1,6) and (2,4), so +2, better.\n\n(6,5) is +1, (1,6) +1, (2,4) +1, so if we get two, better than one.\n\nBut in the no (6,5) path, we get two food, score +2.\n\nIf we eat (6,5), we might get only one.\n\nSo for maximizing score, skipping (6,5) might be better.\n\nBut we need to ensure survival and access.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 43: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 45: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (1,6) eat\n\nAll moves should be safe.\n\nThen we have (2,4) food to eat later.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 42 to 46 or so, but the format is to output for the next turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer should be from turn 42 onwards.\n\nAlso, for the food at (2,4), it is now free and can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 46, head at (1,6), dir L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (0,6) wall invalid, U to (1,7) wall invalid, D to (1,5), R to (2,6) but R opposite to L? Current dir L, so cannot move R.\n\nMoves: from L, can go L, U, D, not R.\n\nL and U invalid, so only D to (1,5).\n\nMove to (1,5), no food, tail removed, etc.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move to (1,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), so we can go to (2,4) to eat.\n\nBut that's beyond 5 turns.\n\nFor now, planning turn 42 to 46.\n\nIn turn 42, we have three choices: U, L, R.\n\nR to (6,5) eats food but may limit options.\n\nU to (5,6) then to (6,6) then to (6,5) on 44 but causes death as above.\n\nL to (4,5) allows going left to get other food.\n\nSo L seems better for long-term.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, on turn 42, if move L to (4,5), we don't eat, but free the tail.\n\nThen turn 43: from (4,5), dir L, we can move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) might be better to go up.\n\nIn the path to (1,6), moving to (3,5) is fine.\n\nTo reach (1,6) faster, from (4,5), move U to (4,6) on turn 43.\n\nThen turn 44: from (4,6), only R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 45: from (5,6), can move to (6,6) or, from dir after move.\n\nTurn 43: move U to (4,6), dir U.\n\nThen turn 44: only R to (5,6), dir R.\n\nThen turn 45: from (5,6), dir R, move to (6,6) or D to (5,5) not possible, so (6,6), dir R.\n\nThen turn 46: from (6,6), only D to (6,5), but (6,5) may be gone or not, but on turn 46, (6,5) is gone if not eaten, life span 3, gone after 44.\n\nSo no food, and we are at (6,6), far from (1,6).\n\nCannot reach (1,6) by 46.\n\nWhereas moving left from (4,5) to (3,5) allows us to reach (2,5) by turn 44, then (2,6) and (1,6).\n\nSo the left path is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 42, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent t1=42.\n\nSo let's plan turns 42 to 46.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nAfter move: head (4,5), dir L, positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] tail (2,4) with food.\n\nTurn 43: from (4,5), dir L, possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4) not possible (body), so L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n\nTo go towards (1,6), move L to (3,5).\n\nMove to (3,5), no food, tail removed, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] tail (2,4) removed, food at (2,4) free.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 44: from (3,5), dir L, moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6) invalid, D to (3,4), not R.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) is tail, move to it safe, but no food.\n\nL to (2,5) free, move to (2,5) to be closer to (1,6).\n\nMove to (2,5), no food, positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (3,4) removed, so tail (4,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 45: from (2,5), dir L, moves: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4), not R.\n\n(2,4) has food, so we can eat it, or go to (2,6) to reach (1,6).\n\n(1,6) must be eaten on turn 46, so better to go to (2,6) first.\n\nMove U to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) empty, move to (2,6), no food, positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,4) removed, so tail (4,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 46: from (2,6), dir U, moves: U to (2,7) invalid, L to (1,6), R to (3,6) invalid, D to (2,5) not allowed (opposite).\n\nSo only L to (1,6).\n\nMove to (1,6), eat food, get +1.\n\nThen head at (1,6), dir L.\n\nThis works.\n\nIf on turn 45 we move to (2,4) to eat, then on turn 46 we can only move to (1,4) or (2,3), not to (1,6), so miss (1,6).\n\nSo better to go to (2,6) on turn 45 to set up for (1,6) on 46.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 44: L (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 45: U (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 46: L (to (1,6))\n\nAnd we eat (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nAlso, (2,4) food is still there, can be eaten later, but not in this plan.\n\nFor the answer, since we need to think 5+ turns, but output the actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a risk in this path?\n\nOn turn 42, move L to (4,5): safe.\n\nTurn 43, move L to (3,5): (3,5) free, safe.\n\nTurn 44, move L to (2,5): free, safe.\n\nTurn 45, move U to (2,6): free, safe.\n\nTurn 46, move L to (1,6): eat, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf we had moved to (6,5) on turn 42, we might not survive or miss other food.\n\nSo this seems better.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must consider the positions of all food items, their remaining life spans, and the snake's current position and body configuration. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the food at (1,6) by turn 46 (life span 5, available until turn 46).\n- Avoid the risky move to (6,5) on turn 42, as it could trap the snake in the top-right corner and prevent reaching (1,6) in time.\n- The food at (6,5) (life span 3, available until turn 44) is not prioritized due to the high risk of collision or missing (1,6). Similarly, (2,4) (life span 8) can be eaten later after turn 46.\n- Move left on turn 42 to (4,5) to start navigating toward (1,6) and free the food at (2,4) by moving the tail away.\n\nThe planned moves for turns 42 to 46 ensure the snake:\n- Safely avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and its body.\n- Reaches (1,6) on turn 46 to eat the food just before it disappears.\n- Sets up potential to eat (2,4) after turn 46 for additional score.\n\n**Move Sequence (5 turns ahead):**\n\n- **Turn 42: L (left)**  \n  Move to (4,5). This avoids the immediate risk of moving right to (6,5) and starts the path toward (1,6). The tail at (1,4) is removed, freeing the food at (2,4) for future consumption. New head direction: L.\n\n- **Turn 43: L (left)**  \n  Move to (3,5). This continues the leftward path, keeping (1,6) accessible. The cell is free, and no food is eaten. New head direction: L.\n\n- **Turn 44: L (left)**  \n  Move to (2,5). This positions the snake closer to (1,6). The cell is free, and no food is eaten. New head direction: L.\n\n- **Turn 45: U (up)**  \n  Move to (2,6). This sets up the final move to (1,6) on turn 46. The cell is free, and no food is eaten. New head direction: U.\n\n- **Turn 46: L (left)**  \n  Move to (1,6) and eat the food (+1 score). This is done on the last possible turn before the food disappears. The move is safe as the cell is adjacent and free, with no collision risk.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Risk Avoidance:** Moving right on turn 42 to eat (6,5) would trap the snake near the wall (e.g., at (6,6) by turn 43), making it impossible to reach (1,6) by turn 46. It also risks a fatal collision on later turns (e.g., turn 45 in some paths). Moving up on turn 42 delays eating (6,5) but could still lead to entrapment or missing (1,6). The chosen leftward path minimizes risk and keeps the snake maneuverable.\n- **Food Prioritization:** (1,6) is prioritized over (6,5) because it contributes equally to the score (+1) and has a later deadline. Skipping (6,5) allows eating both (1,6) and (later) (2,4), maximizing potential score to +2. (6,5) is not worth the risk for only +1.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After turn 46, the snake can safely navigate to eat (2,4) (e.g., via (1,5) or (2,4) directly) or other food. The grid has space leftward and downward, reducing starvation risk.\n- **Life Spans:** \n  - (6,5) expires after turn 44; not eating it is acceptable due to risk.\n  - (1,6) is eaten on turn 46, just in time.\n  - (2,4) expires after turn 49; ample time to eat later.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 42: L \\\\ Turn 43: L \\\\ Turn 44: L \\\\ Turn 45: U \\\\ Turn 46: L }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 43, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,5), then body segments at (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), and tail at (2,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is left, which is L.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive) – but (2,4) is the tail position! That's important.\n\n- (6,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive in this case, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, and different life spans.\n\nThe food at (2,4) is under the tail, so I can only eat it if the tail moves away and then I move the head there. But since it's the tail, when the snake moves, the tail will leave that cell, so the food might be accessible later.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on all borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nSo, plotting this:\n\nRow y=5: cells (4,5) head, (5,5) body\n\ny=4: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) tail? Wait no, positions are in order: index 0 is head, index 1 is (5,5), index 2 is (5,4), index 3 is (6,4), index 4 is (6,3), index 5 is (5,3), index 6 is (4,3), index 7 is (4,4), index 8 is (3,4), index 9 is (2,4). So tail is at (2,4).\n\n(4,4) is part of the body, and (3,4), (2,4).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,5): life span 2, so it disappears after turn 43 + 2 = turn 45? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life span is 2, meaning it will be gone after 2 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at turn t with life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's there for N more turns including this one? Or after N turns from now?\n\nIt says: \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is N, it means after this turn, it has N-1 left? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it's spawned, countdown is N. After that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nFor example, food at (6,5) with life span 2 at turn 43:\n\n- Turn 43: countdown = 2\n\n- After turn 43, countdown =1\n\n- After turn 44, countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 43 or 44, but not after turn 44.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): life span 4 at turn 43, so disappears after turn 46 (turns 43,44,45,46? Countdown: turn43:4, turn44:3, turn45:2, turn46:1, after turn46 it becomes 0 and disappears? I think I need to define when it disappears.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that the food is present for exactly N turns starting from when it was spawned or from now.\n\nBut in this context, at turn 43, the life span is given, so for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and after turn t+L-1, it's gone.\n\nFor (6,5): L=2 at t=43, so can be eaten on turn 43 or 44. After turn 44, gone.\n\n(1,6): L=4, can be eaten turns 43,44,45,46.\n\n(2,4): L=7, turns 43 to 49.\n\n(6,2): L=10, turns 43 to 52.\n\nNow, the food at (2,4) is currently under the tail. The snake tail is at (2,4), so the food is there, but since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n\nSpecifically, for food under the body, it can be eaten only if:\n\n1. The body moves away, and\n\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,4), and food is there. But head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) to (2,4): delta x=2, delta y=1, not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U (up to (4,6)), D (down to (4,4)), L (left to (3,5)), R (right to (5,5)).\n\nBut (5,5) is occupied by the body, so moving right would cause collision. Similarly, (4,4) is occupied by body? Positions: (4,5) head, (5,5) next, so (5,5) is the first body segment. So moving right to (5,5) would hit the body, death.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): is (4,4) occupied? Looking at positions: index 7 is (4,4), which is body, so yes, moving down to (4,4) would also hit body.\n\nList of occupied cells by snake: all positions in the list.\n\nSo at (4,5): head\n\n(5,5): body\n\n(5,4): body\n\n(6,4): body\n\n(6,3): body\n\n(5,3): body\n\n(4,3): body\n\n(4,4): body? Index 7 is (4,4), yes\n\n(3,4): body\n\n(2,4): tail\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nNow, for head at (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) – is this free? y=6, x=4. Walls: y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not border, x=4 not border. Obstacle at (3,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) should be free? But is it occupied by snake? No, not in positions. So U to (4,6) possible.\n\n- D: (4,4) – but (4,4) is occupied by snake (index 7), so moving there would collide, death. Not possible.\n\n- L: (3,5) – x=3, y=5. Walls: x=0 is wall, but x=3 not border. Obstacle at (3,6), not (3,5). Snake positions: is (3,5) occupied? Not in the list. So L to (3,5) should be possible.\n\n- R: (5,5) – but (5,5) is occupied by snake (index 1), so collision, not possible.\n\nSo only possible moves: U or L.\n\nHead direction is L (left), so if I move U or L, that's fine, since not opposite. Opposite of L is R, but R is not possible anyway. If I move D, that would be opposite? D is down, L is left, not opposite. Directions: U and D are vertical, L and R horizontal. Opposite of current direction: since head direction is L, opposite is R. But R is not possible, so moving U or L or D is allowed, but D is not possible because of body.\n\nAvailable moves: U or L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So I should simulate the next moves.\n\nFirst, immediate action for turn 43.\n\nI can choose U or L.\n\nNow, let's look at the food.\n\nFood at (6,5): life span 2, so only available turn 43 and 44. It's at (6,5), which is currently occupied? (6,5) is not in snake positions, and not wall, so it should be free. Snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), etc., no (6,5). So (6,5) is empty with food.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move head there.\n\nFrom (4,5), (6,5) is two steps right, but I can't go right directly because (5,5) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6): (1,6), y=6, x=1. Available turns 43-46.\n\nFood at (2,4): under tail, so I need tail to move away first.\n\nFood at (6,2): available for long time.\n\nAlso, the tail will move when the snake moves, so the food under tail might be accessible later.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,4), and when snake moves, the tail will leave (2,4) only if the snake moves forward and the tail segment is not grown, but since we eat food, length increases.\n\nWhen we eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move that turn? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you move, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position. If you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows. If no food, tail moves off the end.\n\nIn this case, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, length increases by 1, and the tail stays in place for that turn? Or the tail doesn't move.\n\nThe rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, so I think when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail position is the old tail, but since a segment is added, the tail is now the previous segment.\n\nLet's clarify the movement.\n\nTypically in snake: on a move, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail remains where it was. If no food, the tail moves to the next position, so the snake doesn't grow.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without eating: new positions [new_head, old_head, seg1, ..., seg_{n-1}] so tail seg_{n-1} moves to where seg_{n-2} was or something.\n\nBetter to think: the head moves to a new position. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment is left, and a new cell is added at head if food eaten.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Move head to new position.\n\n- If food eaten, add the new head position, and the body segments follow, so tail stays put, length increases.\n\n- If no food eaten, move head to new position, and tail moves off, so the last position is removed.\n\nIn both cases, the body segments shift to the previous position.\n\nFor example, current positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P9 (10 segments)\n\nAfter moving to new cell Q:\n\n- If no eat: new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8 (tail was P9, which is now gone)\n\n- If eat: new positions: Q, P0, P1, ..., P9 (tail P9 stays, length 11)\n\nIn the case where food is under the body, it can be eaten only after the body moves away, meaning that cell is vacated, then head can move to it.\n\nFor food at (2,4), which is current tail. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so (2,4) is vacated, and if there is food, it becomes accessible. Then later, head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut if head moves to it immediately after tail leaves, it might be possible.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut here, head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nNow back to turn 43 action.\n\nOptions: U or L.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U to (4,6).\n\nThen new head position (4,6).\n\nIs there food at (4,6)? No, food is at (6,5), (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). (4,6) has no food, so no eat.\n\nThen snake moves: head to (4,6), then body: (4,5) moves to where head was? Positions: old positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,6) with no eat: new positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ] and tail (2,4) is gone, so positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (4,4), (3,4)? Let's list:\n\nNew head: (4,6)\n\nThen the first body segment is old head (4,5)\n\nThen old seg1 (5,5)\n\nThen (5,4)\n\n(6,4)\n\n(6,3)\n\n(5,3)\n\n(4,3)\n\n(4,4)  // this was index 7\n\n(3,4)  // index 8, now it becomes the tail? Old positions had 10 segments, after move no eat, 9 segments.\n\nOld indices: 0:(4,5) head, 1:(5,5), 2:(5,4), 3:(6,4), 4:(6,3), 5:(5,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(3,4), 9:(2,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,6) no eat: new positions: new head: (4,6), then body: old head (4,5), then old seg1 (5,5), old seg2 (5,4), ..., up to old seg8 (3,4). So segments: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]? That's 10 positions? No.\n\nWhen no eat, the last position is removed, so new positions have one fewer segment.\n\nNew head: (4,6)\n\nThen the next is old position 0: (4,5)\n\nThen old position 1: (5,5)\n\nThen old position 2: (5,4)\n\nThen old position 3: (6,4)\n\nThen old position 4: (6,3)\n\nThen old position 5: (5,3)\n\nThen old position 6: (4,3)\n\nThen old position 7: (4,4)\n\nThen old position 8: (3,4)  // this is now the tail, since old position 9 is gone.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)] 10 segments? Old had 10, after no eat, should be 9.\n\nI think I miscounted the indices.\n\nOld positions: let's number from head: P0 = (4,5), P1 = (5,5), P2 = (5,4), P3 = (6,4), P4 = (6,3), P5 = (5,3), P6 = (4,3), P7 = (4,4), P8 = (3,4), P9 = (2,4)\n\n10 segments.\n\nAfter moving to new head Q with no eat: new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8\n\nBecause P9 is removed.\n\nSo new: head: (4,6), then P0=(4,5), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(5,3), P6=(4,3), P7=(4,4), P8=(3,4)  // and P9=(2,4) is gone, so tail is at (3,4)\n\nNew tail is (3,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is now exposed since tail moved away, but we didn't eat, so food is there.\n\nHead direction: we moved U, so new head direction is U.\n\nNow, if I move L to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free? No snake, no wall, yes.\n\nNo food at (3,5), so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then P0=(4,5), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(5,3), P6=(4,3), P7=(4,4), P8=(3,4)  // P9 gone, tail at (3,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is exposed.\n\nNew head direction L.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (6,5) is available only turn 43 and 44. Turn 43 is now, so I can try to eat it on turn 43 or 44.\n\nFrom current position (4,5), to reach (6,5), I need to go right, but (5,5) is blocked, so I can't go directly.\n\nI could go via other paths.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (4,6), then from there I can go R to (5,6), then to (6,6), then down to (6,5), but that takes multiple turns.\n\n(6,5) disappears after turn 44, so I have this turn and next to eat it.\n\nTurn 43: if I move U to (4,6), then on turn 44, from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6) if possible, then to (6,6), but (6,6) might be wall? y=6, x=6, walls x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,6) is not wall, but is it free? After turn 43 move, positions: after U to (4,6), positions as above: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (5,6) is free, I assume.\n\nThen turn 44, from (4,6), move R to (5,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,6), then body: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc., and tail moves, so (3,4) gone? Let's not detail yet.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, occupied, so collision.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, death.\n\nD to (5,5), occupied, death.\n\nL to (4,6), but that's the body position now, after moving to (5,6), the body is at (4,6), so moving L to (4,6) would hit body.\n\nR to (6,6), which should be free.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), which has food.\n\nBut on turn 44, from (5,6) move R to (6,6), no food, then on turn 45, move D to (6,5), but (6,5) food disappears after turn 44, so on turn 45 it's gone, too late.\n\n(6,5) life span 2 at turn 43, so available turn 43 and 44. After turn 44, gone.\n\nSo to eat on turn 44, I need to be at (6,5) on turn 44.\n\nFrom current turn 43 position (4,5), I can't reach (6,5) in one move because blocked.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) on turn 43, then from (3,5) on turn 44, I can move R to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, wall, death.\n\nD to (3,4), which is body, occupied, death.\n\nL to (2,5), if free, but x=2,y=5, not wall, not occupied? After turn 43 move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), etc., so (2,5) free? Probably.\n\nBut (2,5) no food.\n\nThen from there, not closer to (6,5).\n\nSo from current position, I cannot reach (6,5) on turn 43 or 44 because it's blocked and I can't get there in time. Turn 43: I can't go directly, turn 44: from U or L, I can't reach (6,5) in one step from the new positions.\n\nFor example, after U to (4,6) on turn 43, on turn 44 head at (4,6), (6,5) is two steps away: to (5,6) then to (6,5), but I can't go directly to (6,5) from (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go to (5,6), then to (6,6), then to (6,5) on turn 45, but food gone.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5) after L move, even worse.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (6,5) because it's only available for two turns and I can't reach it due to body blocks.\n\nPerhaps I should give up on (6,5) since it's high risk or impossible.\n\nNow, other food.\n\nFood at (1,6): available turns 43-46, so more time.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom current (4,5), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (3,6), so I can't go directly to (3,6).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFood at (2,4): under tail, but tail will move, so it will be exposed soon.\n\nFood at (6,2): south-west, available long time.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nCurrent only moves U or L.\n\nLet's think about the tail food.\n\nFood at (2,4) is under tail. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, exposing the food.\n\nFor example, on turn 43, if I move U or L without eating, the tail moves from (2,4), so (2,4) becomes free with food.\n\nThen on turn 44, I can move to (2,4) to eat it, but I need to be able to reach it.\n\nHead is at (4,5) now, (2,4) is at distance: dx=2, dy=1, so not adjacent.\n\nAfter turn 43 move, head will be at (4,6) or (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (2,4): not adjacent, need multiple moves.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,4): adjacent? (3,5) to (2,4): dx=1, dy=1, not adjacent, diagonal, not sharing edge. Adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1.\n\nSo (3,5) to (2,4): different row and column, not adjacent.\n\nTo reach (2,4) from (3,5), I need to go to (2,5) or (3,4), but (3,4) is body.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, option: move L on turn 43 to (3,5).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)  // tail at (3,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is now exposed.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nOn turn 44, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6) but (3,6) is obstacle, wall, death\n\n- D: (3,4) but (3,4) is tail, occupied, collision if I move there\n\n- L: (2,5) should be free? Walls x=0, x=1 not border? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 is ok. y=5, not wall. Snake positions: after move, positions include (3,4) but not (2,5), so (2,5) free.\n\n- R: (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move: L to (2,5)\n\nNo food at (2,5), so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)? Old tail was (3,4), which is now body, and new tail is old P7 or something.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) no eat: new head (2,5), then old head (3,5), then old P1 (4,5), ..., up to old P8 (3,4)? Earlier: after turn 43, positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (2,5) no eat: new positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  and (3,4) gone, tail at (4,4)\n\nFood at (2,4) is still there, but head is at (2,5), so adjacent to (2,4)? (2,5) and (2,4) same x, dy=1, so adjacent vertically.\n\nNow, (2,4) has food, and head is at (2,5) adjacent to it.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4) on next turn, I can eat it, but there is tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, tail is at (4,4), not at (2,4). (2,4) is the food cell, but tail is at (4,4), far away.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent to that cell.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) has food, head at (2,5) is adjacent, but tail is at (4,4), not at (2,4), so no issue. I can move to (2,4) to eat.\n\nOn turn 45, from (2,5), move D to (2,4), eat food, length increases.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc., and tail stays, so positions include old tail (4,4) and new segment.\n\nBut (2,4) was food, now head is there.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions.\n\nAfter turn 44: head at (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nMove to (2,4) and eat: new head (2,4), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail (4,4) stays, so length 11, positions from head to tail: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow, if I had moved U on turn 43.\n\nMove U to (4,6) on turn 43.\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4) exposed.\n\nOn turn 44, from (4,6), I can move, say, L to (3,6), but (3,6) obstacle, death.\n\nOr R to (5,6), if free.\n\nOr D to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,7), y=7 wall.\n\nSo only possible R to (5,6).\n\nAssume (5,6) free.\n\nMove to (5,6), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail (3,4) gone, new tail (4,4)? After move: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow head at (5,6), far from (2,4). To reach (2,4), it takes many moves, and food might be eaten by someone else? No, only one snake.\n\nBut (2,4) is available until turn 49, so time.\n\nBut in the L move option, I can eat (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nSimilarly, I can consider other food.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near (2,5) or something.\n\nIn the L move path, after eating (2,4) on turn 45, head at (2,4), then I can go to (1,6) or other.\n\nBut (1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (1,6): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4) after eating: head at (2,4), direction down (since moved D).\n\nThen I can move L to (1,4), or U to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is above.\n\nNeed to go left and up.\n\nThere's an obstacle at (3,6), so I need to go around.\n\nBut (1,6) available until turn 46, so time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,2) far away.\n\nNow, back to turn 43 decision.\n\nIf I move L on turn 43, I can potentially eat (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nIf I move U, I might not eat it soon.\n\nBut in U move, I could go for other food.\n\nAlso, I need to think about survival and space.\n\nThe snake is quite long, 10 segments, in a 8x8 grid with obstacles.\n\nAvailable space: grid 8x8, but borders walls, so 6x6 internal, minus obstacle at (3,6), so 35 cells free? Total cells: 64, minus 4 borders, but walls are the cells, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6)? No.\n\nWalls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nThe grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cannot move there. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) obstacle.\n\nSo total playable: 6x6=36 minus 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 10 cells, so 25 free cells.\n\nAfter moves, it changes.\n\nBut with snake moving, it can access areas.\n\nNow, the food at (2,4) is easy to eat if I go left, as above.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6) can be eaten later.\n\nFood at (6,2) is at (6,2), which is near the body.\n\nFrom current, if I move U, I might go towards (1,6).\n\nBut let's prioritize.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 43, I have two choices: U or L.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (3,5) on turn 43.\n\nThen as above, on turn 44, only move L to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 45, move D to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, positions as before.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction D.\n\nNow on turn 46, from (2,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,5) but (2,5) is body? After eating on turn 45, positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo (2,5) is body, so cannot move U to (2,5).\n\nD: to (2,3) if free. y=3, x=2, not wall. Is it occupied? Not in positions, so possible.\n\nL: to (1,4) if free.\n\nR: to (3,4) but (3,4) is not in positions? Positions have (4,4) tail, (4,3), etc. (3,4) is not there; after eating, tail is at (4,4), so (3,4) might be free.\n\nList: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo occupied: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is free? Not occupied.\n\n(1,4) free, (2,3) free, etc.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves:\n\nU: (2,5) occupied, no\n\nD: (2,3) free, yes\n\nL: (1,4) free, yes\n\nR: (3,4) free, yes\n\nDirection is D, so opposite is U, but U not possible anyway.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is up-left.\n\nI can move L to (1,4), then U to (1,5), then U to (1,6) to eat.\n\n(1,6) available until turn 46, so on turn 46,47,48? Turn 43,44,45,46 available.\n\nTurn 46 is still available.\n\nIf I move to (1,4) on turn 46, then on turn 47 to (1,5), then turn 48 to (1,6), but turn 46 is the last for (1,6)? Life span 4 at turn 43: available turns 43,44,45,46. After turn 46, gone.\n\nSo to eat on turn 46, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, head at (2,4), not at (1,6), so cannot eat on turn 46.\n\nMust eat by turn 46, so latest turn 46.\n\nBut on turn 46, from (2,4), I can go to (1,4) or (2,3), not to (1,6) directly.\n\nSo I can't reach (1,6) by turn 46 from here.\n\nAfter turn 45, head at (2,4), turn 46 I move, say, L to (1,4), then (1,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (1,4) on turn 47, move U to (1,5), then on turn 48 to (1,6), but (1,6) gone after turn 46, so turn 48 too late.\n\nThus, I cannot eat (1,6) if I go for the tail food first.\n\nIf I don't go for tail food, I might eat (1,6) earlier.\n\nBack to turn 43.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6) on turn 43.\n\nThen on turn 44, move R to (5,6) as before.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow, (1,6) is at (1,6), from (5,6) I can go left.\n\nOn turn 44, head at (5,6), possible moves:\n\nU: (5,7) y=7 wall, no\n\nD: (5,5) occupied, body, no\n\nL: (4,6) occupied, body, no\n\nR: (6,6) free, yes\n\nSo only R to (6,6)\n\nMove to (6,6), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail (4,4) gone, new tail (4,3)? After move: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nNow on turn 45, from (6,6), possible moves:\n\nU: (6,7) wall, no\n\nD: (6,5) but (6,5) food is gone after turn 44, so no food, and (6,5) might be free? Not occupied, so move D to (6,5) possible, but no food.\n\nL: (5,6) occupied, body, no\n\nR: (7,6) x=7 wall, no\n\nSo only D to (6,5)\n\nMove to (6,5), no food now, so positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (4,3) gone, new tail (5,3)\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nFood at (1,6) is gone, since after turn 46, but it's turn 45, so (1,6) still available until turn 46.\n\nBut from (6,5) to (1,6) far, can't reach in one turn.\n\nOn turn 46, I can be somewhere, but (1,6) must be eaten by turn 46.\n\nFrom (6,5), on turn 46, I can move, say, L to (5,5) but occupied, or U to (6,6) occupied, or D to (6,4) occupied, or R not possible.\n\nFrom (6,5), adjacent: (6,6) body, (6,4) body, (5,5) body, (7,5) wall. All blocked except perhaps (5,5) but occupied, so death? No, (5,5) is occupied, so no move possible? That can't be.\n\nPositions: after turn 45, head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo cells around (6,5): (6,6) occupied, (6,4) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (7,5) wall. So all directions blocked, snake trapped, death on next move.\n\nOh, problem. If I go up and right, I might get trapped.\n\nIn this path, after moving to (6,5) on turn 45, I have no safe moves on turn 46, so I die.\n\nTherefore, moving U on turn 43 leads to a trap after a few moves.\n\nNot good for survival.\n\nWhereas if I move L on turn 43, I can eat the food at (2,4) and have more space to the left.\n\nAfter eating at (2,4) on turn 45, head at (2,4), and I can move to (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\n(3,4) might be free, as before.\n\nThen I can navigate to other areas.\n\nFood at (1,6) I can't eat because time, but it's only one point, not critical.\n\nFood at (6,2) is available for long time, life span 10, so until turn 52.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but not given.\n\nSo for survival, moving L is better.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the internal obstacle.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,4) is under tail, but when I eat it, since it's positive, I grow, but no immediate danger.\n\nIn the sequence: if I move L on turn 43 to (3,5), then turn 44 L to (2,5), then turn 45 D to (2,4) eat.\n\nThen on turn 46, from (2,4), I can move, say, L to (1,4) or D to (2,3).\n\n(1,4) is free, (2,3) free.\n\nSuppose I move L to (1,4) on turn 46.\n\nThen positions: head to (1,4), no food, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nOld positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (1,4) no eat: new head (1,4), then body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (4,4) and (4,3) gone? New positions: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nThen I can continue, etc.\n\nFood at (6,2) at (6,2), which is near (6,3) but (6,3) is body.\n\nI can go down or something.\n\nBut with 10 or 11 segments, space might be tight, but I have time.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output actions for the next turns, starting from t1=43.\n\nAnd think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo for turn 43, action.\n\nBased on above, moving L seems better for survival and eating the tail food.\n\nMoving U risks trapping.\n\nTherefore, I should move L on turn 43.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to specify.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 43: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44: move L to (2,5)  // only choice, as above\n\nTurn 45: move D to (2,4) to eat food\n\nNow, after that, on turn 46, from (2,4), I can move to available cells.\n\nFor example, move L to (1,4) to go towards the left side.\n\nOr D to (2,3) to go down.\n\nBut (1,6) food is gone by turn 46, so not relevant.\n\nFood at (6,2) is at (6,2), life span 10, so available for many turns.\n\nI should head towards (6,2) eventually.\n\nBut not urgent.\n\nAlso, to avoid trapping, I should explore open areas.\n\nCurrently, after eating at (2,4), the snake is coiled in the bottom-left to center.\n\nPositions: (2,4) head, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo the area around (3,4) might be free, and down to (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nI can move down to (2,3) on turn 46.\n\nFrom (2,4), move D to (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can continue down or left.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nSince the food at (2,4) is eaten, and others are available.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 43 and a few more.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list for several turns.\n\nSince t1=43, start from turn 43.\n\nAnd I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, the snake head direction changes.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 43: move L, so direction becomes L.\n\nTurn 44: move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 45: move D, direction D.\n\nThen turn 46: I need to choose.\n\nTo be safe, I can move L to (1,4) or D to (2,3).\n\n(1,4) is left, (2,3) down.\n\nBoth seem ok, but (2,3) might be better to go down towards (6,2) eventually.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom-right.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should consider the walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is top, so not affecting bottom.\n\nFor now, moving D to (2,3) might open more space.\n\nSince I need to output, let's decide.\n\nAnother point: in turn 46, if I move R to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, but after positions, (3,4) is not occupied, so I can move R to (3,4).\n\nThen from there to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4) which is body, but if I move to (3,4), it should be free.\n\nIn positions after turn 45: occupied are (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free, (2,3) free, (3,3) free, etc.\n\nSo from (2,4), move to (3,4) is possible.\n\nThen head at (3,4), which is closer to center.\n\nBut I think for long-term, going left or down is fine.\n\nSince the grid has more space on the bottom or left, but with snake, it's dynamic.\n\nBut to be concrete, for the answer, I'll plan to move L on turn 43, then L on 44, D on 45, and then say on turn 46 move D to (2,3) to head down.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: turn 43 to 47 or something.\n\nSince think 5+ ahead, output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: L\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D (to (2,3))\n\nThen from (2,3), on turn 47, I can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify too far.\n\nI think for the response, I should output the actions I decided.\n\nNow, about the food at (6,5), I concluded I can't eat it, so ignore.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) might not be reachable in time.\n\nSo best to go for the tail food.\n\nTherefore, for turn 43: move L\n\nThen turn 44: move L (only choice)\n\nTurn 45: move D to eat the food at (2,4)\n\nThen for turn 46, I need to choose a move.\n\nFrom (2,4), after eating, I can move to (2,3), (1,4), or (3,4).\n\nTo avoid the body, moving D to (2,3) might be good, opening new area.\n\n(2,3) is bottom-left.\n\nThen from there, I can go right or down.\n\ny=3, x=2.\n\nWalls y=0, so y=1,2,3 are playable, y=0 wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 wall, so (2,3) is ok.\n\nThen move to (2,3).\n\nNo food there.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) but occupied, D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nU to (2,4) body, no; so D, L, or R.\n\nI can move D to (2,2), for example.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nSince the answer format might expect only the necessary, but I think I should provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 43 action.\n\nBut the user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term\", so I should show the plan.\n\nIn the boxed answer, list actions for several turns.\n\nLet me decide.\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: L\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nFor turn 46: I'll move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 47: from (2,3), move R to (3,3) to go towards center.\n\nThen turn 48, etc., but not necessary.\n\nSince food at (6,2) is there, I can head that way slowly.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n\nIn the initial U move option, it was dangerous, so L is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with moving left on turn 43.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 43 Decision\n\nTo maximize long-term score and survival, I must think 5+ turns ahead. The current state (turn 43) has the snake at positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)] with head direction left (L). Only moves up (U) or left (L) are safe, as down (D) and right (R) lead to body collisions.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Food Availability**:\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 44). Cannot be eaten by turn 44 due to body blocks and path constraints, so it is abandoned.\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 46). Cannot be reached by turn 46 from the left path without risking survival.\n  - (2,4): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 49). Currently under the tail. Moving left exposes this food on turn 44, allowing it to be eaten on turn 45 without tail reward danger (head not adjacent to tail during eating).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 52). Can be targeted later for long-term gain.\n- **Survival Priority**: Moving up (U) on turn 43 leads to a potential trap (e.g., at (6,5) by turn 46) with no safe moves, risking death. Moving left (L) avoids this, allows eating (2,4), and opens space for navigation.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turn 43**: Move L to (3,5) to expose food at (2,4) and avoid risks.\n  - **Turn 44**: Only safe move is L to (2,5) (U/D/R blocked by walls or body).\n  - **Turn 45**: Move D to (2,4) to eat the positive food (score +1, length increases to 11).\n  - **Turn 46**: From (2,4), move D to (2,3) to explore open space and avoid body.\n  - **Turn 47**: From (2,3), move R to (3,3) to head toward the center and eventually target (6,2).\n\nThis plan secures +1 score by turn 45, ensures survival, and positions the snake for future food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 44: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 45: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 46: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 47: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 44. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and a block at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). That's 10 segments. The head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (3,5) from (4,5)? Positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (3,5), (4,5), etc. Since head direction is L, it came from the right, so previous head was (4,5), moved left to (3,5).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (2,4) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (6,2) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so x increases right, y increases up. Walls: left x=0, right x=7, bottom y=0, top y=7. Obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). Tail is at (3,4).\n\nPlotting this:\n\nRow y=7: wall\n\ny=6: walls at x=0 and x=7, and obstacle at (3,6), so cells (0,6) to (7,6) except (3,6) is blocked? No, walls are only the borders and specific obstacles. Border cells are x=0, x=7 for all y, and y=0, y=7 for all x. Internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is a wall cell.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nBut for movement, we care about where we can go.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,5)\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5))\n\nBut we have constraints:\n\n- Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is L (left), so cannot move R (right) next turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nAlso, check for collisions.\n\nFirst, U to (3,6): (3,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles: [(3,6)], so (3,6) is a wall, so moving there causes wall collision, death.\n\nD to (3,4): what is at (3,4)? Snake positions: tail is at (3,4), but since the tail will move when we move, if we move down, head goes to (3,4), and the tail will move from (3,4) to... let's see the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, a new segment is added at the end.\n\nBut in this case, if we move to (3,4), which is currently occupied by the tail. But the rule says: we can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward. So it should be safe, as long as after movement, head and tail don't collide in a way that causes issue.\n\nSpecifically: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,4) should be safe because the tail is there now, but after head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, L to (2,5): what is there? Not in snake positions, not a wall, so should be empty.\n\nR to (4,5): but (4,5) is a body segment, second in list after head. Snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), ... so (4,5) is the first body segment. If we move right to (4,5), head would collide with body, death. And since it's not the tail, it's dangerous.\n\nConfirm: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, but tail is special.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for (4,5), it's not the tail; tail is (3,4). Positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (3,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is body segment, not tail. If head moves to (4,5), it would be on the same cell as segment 1, causing collision.\n\nTherefore, possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) - wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,4) - currently tail, but safe to move there\n\n- L: (2,5) - empty, should be safe\n\n- R: (4,5) - body segment, collision, invalid\n\nAlso, cannot move right because current direction is left, so moving right is opposite, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible moves: D or L.\n\nNow, food: (6,5) is at (6,5) with life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. But (6,5) is not adjacent to head; head is at (3,5), (6,5) is three cells right.\n\nAlso, (1,6) at (1,6), life span 3\n\n(2,4) at (2,4), life span 6\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), life span 9\n\nAll value +1.\n\nNow, (6,5) has only one turn left, so if not eaten now, it vanishes.\n\nBut can we reach it? From (3,5), to get to (6,5), we need to move right, but right is not possible now, and even if it were, it's three steps away, so impossible to eat this turn. Since life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so we can't eat it anyway. So forget about (6,5).\n\nNow, other food.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, current turn t=44, action: we can choose D or L.\n\nIf we move D to (3,4), what happens? Head moves to (3,4), which was the tail. Since we move there, and if we eat food or not? (3,4) has food? Food positions: (6,5), (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). (2,4) is at (2,4), not (3,4). So no food at (3,4), so we don't eat, snake moves, tail moves away. New head at (3,4), new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — wait, tail was (3,4), but since we moved to it and no food, tail segment is removed? Let's clarify snake movement.\n\nStandard snake: when moving to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed. So the snake shortens by one? No, length unchanged if no food eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body follows, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn this case, if we move D to (3,4):\n\n- Head was at (3,5), moves to (3,4)\n\n- Body segments: segment 1 (was at (4,5)) moves to previous head position (3,5)\n\nSegment 2 (5,5) moves to (4,5)\n\nSegment 3 (5,4) moves to (5,5)\n\nSegment 4 (6,4) moves to (5,4)\n\nSegment 5 (6,3) moves to (6,4)\n\nSegment 6 (5,3) moves to (6,3)\n\nSegment 7 (4,3) moves to (5,3)\n\nSegment 8 (4,4) moves to (4,3)\n\nSegment 9 (3,4) was tail, but since head moves to (3,4), and no food, the tail is removed, so the last segment is gone.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,4), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — (4,4) was segment 8, which moved to (4,3)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move down to (3,4):\n\n- Head new: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to old head (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to old seg1 (4,5)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to old seg2 (5,5)\n\n- Segment 4: moves to old seg3 (5,4)\n\n- Segment 5: moves to old seg4 (6,4)\n\n- Segment 6: moves to old seg5 (6,3)\n\n- Segment 7: moves to old seg6 (5,3)\n\n- Segment 8: moves to old seg7 (4,3)\n\n- Segment 9: moves to old seg8 (4,4)\n\nBut old seg8 was (4,4), so segment 9 moves to (4,4)? Positions: old positions before move:\n\n0: (3,5) head\n\n1: (4,5)\n\n2: (5,5)\n\n3: (5,4)\n\n4: (6,4)\n\n5: (6,3)\n\n6: (5,3)\n\n7: (4,3)\n\n8: (4,4)\n\n9: (3,4) tail\n\nAfter move down, head to (3,4), which is where tail was.\n\nNo food eaten, so tail is removed. The new snake has 9 segments? Length decreases only if no food, but the snake should keep the same length unless food eaten.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake: when you move without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail cell is left empty. The snake length remains the same; it doesn't shorten. The tail moves forward, so the last segment is still there but in a new position.\n\nIn terms of positions: the head moves to new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment before it. So the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i>0.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head position: (3,4)\n\n- New position of segment that was segment 1: it moves to where head was, (3,5)\n\n- New position of segment that was segment 2: moves to where segment 1 was, (4,5)\n\n- Similarly, new segment 3: to (5,5)\n\n- New segment 4: to (5,4)\n\n- New segment 5: to (6,4)\n\n- New segment 6: to (6,3)\n\n- New segment 7: to (5,3)  // old segment 6 was at (6,3), moves to where segment 5 was? Let's index.\n\nOld positions:\n\nIndex 0: (3,5)\n\nIndex 1: (4,5)\n\nIndex 2: (5,5)\n\nIndex 3: (5,4)\n\nIndex 4: (6,4)\n\nIndex 5: (6,3)\n\nIndex 6: (5,3)\n\nIndex 7: (4,3)\n\nIndex 8: (4,4)\n\nIndex 9: (3,4)  // tail\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)  // this was old index 9\n\n- New body segments:\n\n- Segment 1 (was index 0): moves to (3,5)  // but (3,5) is now occupied? No, positions are updated simultaneously.\n\nThe movement is: head moves to new cell, then each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new positions:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to old head position, (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to old segment 1 position, (4,5)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to old segment 2 position, (5,5)\n\n- Segment 4: moves to old segment 3 position, (5,4)\n\n- Segment 5: moves to old segment 4 position, (6,4)\n\n- Segment 6: moves to old segment 5 position, (6,3)\n\n- Segment 7: moves to old segment 6 position, (5,3)\n\n- Segment 8: moves to old segment 7 position, (4,3)\n\n- Segment 9: moves to old segment 8 position, (4,4)\n\nAnd the old tail position (3,4) is now head, so no issue.\n\nNew snake positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo the tail is at (4,4).\n\nAnd the cell (3,4) is now head, and (4,4) is tail.\n\nIf we had eaten food, a new segment would be added at the tail end, so tail stays, and new segment added at old tail position or something.\n\nBut here no food, so length same.\n\nBack to choice.\n\nIf we move D to (3,4), no food there, so new head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 44, we can also move L to (2,5).\n\nIf move L to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4), and (3,4) is no longer part of snake? Old positions: head (3,5) move to (2,5), segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (4,5), ..., segment 9 to (4,4), and segment 10 was (3,4) but not moved to, so tail is at (4,4), and (3,4) is empty.\n\nNew snake: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow, we need to think about food.\n\nFood at (2,4) with life span 6, so it will be there for 6 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 44, life span 6, so it disappears after turn 44 + 6 = turn 50? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1, so not present on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, food with life span 1 at turn 44: present only on turn 44, disappears after turn 44, so not on turn 45.\n\nLife span 1: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 44, countdown=1, after turn 44, countdown=0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, life span 3: at turn 44, countdown=3, after turn 44, countdown=2, still there; after turn 45, countdown=1, still there; after turn 46, countdown=0, disappears, so not on turn 47.\n\nSo for (2,4), life span 6 at turn 44, so it will be there until turn 44+5 = 49? Let's see:\n\nTurn 44: countdown=6\n\nAfter turn 44 (before turn 45): countdown=5\n\nTurn 45: countdown=5, present\n\nAfter turn 45: countdown=4\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 48: countdown=1\n\nAfter turn 49: countdown=0, disappears, so not on turn 50.\n\nIt is present from turn 44 to turn 49 inclusive, 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 1: only on turn 44, gone after.\n\n(1,6) life span 3: turn 44,45,46, gone after 46.\n\n(6,2) life span 9: turn 44 to 52, gone after 52.\n\nNow, back to action at turn 44.\n\nWe have two choices: move D or move L.\n\nIf move L to (2,5), we are closer to (2,4) food, which is at (2,4), and (1,6).\n\nIf move D to (3,4), we are at (3,4), and food at (2,4) is adjacent.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is left of (3,4)? (3,4) and (2,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, at turn 44, tail is at (3,4), and head is at (3,5), so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a cell or? Adjacent means next to, not same cell.\n\nHead at (3,5), tail at (3,4), which is below, so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut tail cell (3,4) has food? Food positions: (6,5), (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). None at (3,4), so no food on tail, so no danger.\n\nIf we move to (3,4), we move to tail position, but no food there, so safe.\n\nBut after moving, new tail is at (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, let's think about eating (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), value +1.\n\nIf we move L to (2,5) at turn 44, then from (2,5), we can move down to (2,4) on turn 45 to eat it.\n\nBut need to check if that is safe.\n\nFirst, option: move L at turn 44 to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 45: head at (2,5), direction left (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nU to (2,6): is that wall? y=6, x=2. Walls: border y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, but internal walls? Only borders and (3,6). (2,6) should be free, unless it's wall.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 for any y, or y=0 or y=7 for any x. So for (2,6), x=2 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle only (3,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,4): (2,4) has food.\n\nL to (1,5): free, probably.\n\nR to (3,5): but current direction L, so cannot move R, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nAlso, (3,5) is now a body segment after we moved.\n\nAfter turn 44 move L to (2,5), new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (3,5) is body segment.\n\nIf we move to (3,5) from (2,5), it would be collision with body.\n\nBut we can't move R anyway because of direction.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5)\n\nNow, if we move D to (2,4) on turn 45, we eat the food at (2,4), since it's there.\n\nThen, eating food: head moves to (2,4), which has food, so we eat it, snake grows, new segment added at tail.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,4), then the body: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, new segment added at previous tail position.\n\nAfter move to (2,4), head new position (2,4), body segments shift: segment 1 to old head (2,5), segment 2 to old seg1 (3,5), ..., up to segment 9 to old seg8 (4,4), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at old tail position, which was (4,4), so new tail at (4,4)? Let's see.\n\nOld positions before turn 45 move: head at (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nMove down to (2,4): head to (2,4), which has food.\n\nSo, eat food, so new head: (2,4)\n\nThen body: segment 1 moves to old head (2,5)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old seg1 (3,5)\n\nSegment 3 moves to old seg2 (4,5)\n\n...\n\nSegment 9 moves to old seg8 (4,3)  // old seg8 was (4,3)? Positions: old seg1: (3,5), old seg2: (4,5), old seg3: (5,5), old seg4: (5,4), old seg5: (6,4), old seg6: (6,3), old seg7: (5,3), old seg8: (4,3), old seg9: (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move and eat:\n\n- Head new: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: to old head (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: to old seg1 (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3: to old seg2 (4,5)\n\n- Segment 4: to old seg3 (5,5)\n\n- Segment 5: to old seg4 (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6: to old seg5 (6,4)\n\n- Segment 7: to old seg6 (6,3)\n\n- Segment 8: to old seg7 (5,3)\n\n- Segment 9: to old seg8 (4,3)\n\nAnd since food eaten, add new segment at old tail position (4,4), so new segment 10 at (4,4)\n\nNew snake: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nLength 11, head at (2,4), direction down.\n\nNow, this seems fine, no immediate danger.\n\nBut we need to think long-term.\n\nIf at turn 44 we move D instead to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 44: move D to (3,4), no food, so new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 45: from (3,4), we can move to (2,4) to eat the food, since (2,4) is left and adjacent.\n\nCurrent direction down, but we can move left, not opposite.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5): but (3,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nD to (3,3): free? y=3, x=3, not wall, not occupied.\n\nL to (2,4): food there.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is tail, so safe to move there, but no food.\n\nCurrent direction down, so moving left or right is not opposite, should be ok.\n\nIf we move L to (2,4), we eat the food.\n\nHead to (2,4), eat, so new head (2,4), body: segment 1 to old head (3,4), segment 2 to old seg1 (3,5), ..., and add new segment at old tail (4,4).\n\nOld positions before move: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nMove left to (2,4):\n\n- Head new: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: to old head (3,4)\n\n- Segment 2: to old seg1 (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3: to old seg2 (4,5)\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment 9: to old seg8 (4,3)  // old seg8 was (4,3)? Segments: old seg1: (3,5), old seg2: (4,5), ..., old seg8: (4,3), old seg9: (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)\n\n- Seg2: (3,5)\n\n- Seg3: (4,5)\n\n- Seg4: (5,5)\n\n- Seg5: (5,4)\n\n- Seg6: (6,4)\n\n- Seg7: (6,3)\n\n- Seg8: (5,3)\n\n- Seg9: (4,3)\n\nAnd new segment at old tail (4,4), so (4,4)\n\nNew snake: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nIn both cases, we can eat (2,4) on turn 45, by choosing L or D at turn 44.\n\nBut if we choose L at turn 44, we go to (2,5), then D to (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nIf we choose D at turn 44, we go to (3,4), then L to (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nSo we get to eat the food either way on turn 45.\n\nBut the path might matter for future moves.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6) with life span 3, so it will be gone after turn 46, meaning we have until turn 46 to eat it.\n\nTurn 46 is the last turn it exists.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has longer life.\n\nNow, after eating (2,4), we are at (2,4) with the snake longer.\n\nWe need to think about other food.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space, and we have walls and obstacles.\n\nMoreover, we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid roughly.\n\nGrid 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7)\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal wall at (3,6)\n\nSnake initial positions at turn 44: head (3,5), body down to (3,4), but positions are: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nAfter eating (2,4), snake is longer.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\ny=6 is not wall, but borders at x=0 and x=7.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent to (1,5), (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so not, (0,6) wall, (2,6), (1,5) etc.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (2,4), we need to move up and left.\n\nBut after turn 45, if we ate (2,4), head at (2,4), direction to (2,4) from previous.\n\nIn the first scenario, if we moved L then D to (2,4), direction down.\n\nIf we moved D then L to (2,4), direction left.\n\nNow, from (2,4), we can go to (1,6) via (2,5) or (1,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) might be body segment.\n\nLet's take the first choice: at turn 44, move L to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 45, move D to (2,4) to eat food, as before.\n\nNow turn 45: after eating, head at (2,4), direction down (since moved down from (2,5)).\n\nSnake positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow turn 46: we need to move to reach (1,6) if possible, but (1,6) disappears after turn 46, so must eat on turn 46 or earlier, but we are on turn 46 now? Turn 45 we just moved, so for turn 46.\n\nTurn 46 action.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction down, so cannot move U (up), instant reverse.\n\nD to (2,3): free? (2,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nL to (1,4): free, probably.\n\nR to (3,4): but (3,4) is body segment? Positions: (2,4) head, (2,5) body, (3,5) body, ..., (4,4) body, so (3,4) is not in list, should be free.\n\nPositions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo cells: (2,4) head, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free, (2,3) free.\n\nU to (2,5): but (2,5) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nD to (2,3): free.\n\nL to (1,4): free.\n\nR to (3,4): free.\n\nCannot U.\n\nSo possible: D, L, R.\n\nNow, to reach (1,6), which is two steps away: we need to go to (1,4) or (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (2,4), L to (1,4) then U to (1,5) then U to (1,6) if possible.\n\nBut on turn 46, we can move to (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf we move L to (1,4), then head to (1,4), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew head (1,4), direction left (since moved left from (2,4)).\n\nThen turn 47: from (1,4), we can move U to (1,5), then turn 48 U to (1,6), but (1,6) disappears after turn 46? (1,6) life span 3 at turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: present\n\nTurn 45: present (countdown 2)\n\nTurn 46: present (countdown 1), disappears after turn 46, so not on turn 47.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), must be on or before turn 46.\n\nOn turn 46, from (2,4), we cannot reach (1,6) directly; it's two cells away: (1,6) from (2,4) is not adjacent, we need to move to (2,5) or (1,4) first, but (2,5) is occupied, so we can only go to (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), we are not at (1,6), and on turn 47 it is gone.\n\nSo from turn 46 position, we cannot eat (1,6) because it's not reachable in one move from (2,4), and after turn 46 it vanishes.\n\nTherefore, if we go to (2,4) on turn 45, we miss (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) could be eaten earlier?\n\nAt turn 44, if we move to (2,5) by moving L.\n\nThen at turn 45, instead of moving down to (2,4), we could move up to (2,6) or left to (1,5), to get closer to (1,6).\n\nFor example, at turn 44: move L to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 45: head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5)\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5) or (2,6) or (1,7) but y=7 wall, so only (1,5) and (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), if we move L to (1,5) on turn 45, then (1,5) is adjacent to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 46, we can move U to (1,6) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if we move U to (2,6), then L to (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 45, if we move L to (1,5) from (2,5).\n\n(1,5) has food? No, food at (1,6), not (1,5).\n\nSo move to (1,5), no food, snake moves.\n\nNew head (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 46: from (1,5), we can move U to (1,6) to eat the food.\n\n(1,6) is present on turn 46, since countdown to 1, disappears after.\n\nSo eat on turn 46.\n\nSimilarly, if we had moved U to (2,6) on turn 45, then from (2,6), move L to (1,6) on turn 46 to eat.\n\nBut (2,6) might be free.\n\nIn this case, we can eat (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nBut if we do that, we don't eat (2,4) immediately.\n\n(2,4) has life span 6, so it will be there until turn 49, so we can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, we have (6,2) with long life.\n\nBut by going to (1,6), we might be in a corner.\n\nLet's compare the options.\n\nFirst, at turn 44, if we move L to (2,5), we can then choose to go for (1,6) or for (2,4).\n\nIf we go for (1,6), we eat it on turn 46, but miss the opportunity to eat (2,4) on turn 45, but (2,4) can be eaten later.\n\nIf we eat (2,4) on turn 45, we miss (1,6) entirely.\n\nSince (1,6) disappears soon, it might be better to eat it first if possible.\n\nBut (2,4) is closer in a way.\n\nAnother option: at turn 44, if we move D to (3,4), then on turn 45 we can eat (2,4) by moving L, as before.\n\nBut from (3,4), after moving D, we are at (3,4), and to eat (1,6), it's farther.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,4) on turn 45 from (3,4), we are at (2,4), same as before, and cannot reach (1,6) on turn 46.\n\nSo only by going via (2,5) we can reach (1,6).\n\nTherefore, to eat both foods, we should go for (1,6) first.\n\nSo at turn 44, move L to (2,5).\n\nThen at turn 45, instead of moving down to (2,4), move to (1,5) or (2,6) to approach (1,6).\n\nNow, which is better?\n\nMove to (1,5) or to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is near the top, y=6.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (2,6) is safe, I think.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is at left.\n\nAlso, there is an internal wall at (3,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\nLet's see the area.\n\nIf we move to (1,5) on turn 45.\n\nTurn 44: move L to (2,5)\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 45: move L to (1,5)\n\n(1,5) no food, so move to (1,5), head new (1,5), body: segment 1 to old head (2,5), segment 2 to old seg1 (3,5), ..., segment 9 to old seg8 (4,3), and tail to (4,4)? Old tail (4,4), no food, so tail moves, new positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) same as before but head at (1,5).\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 46: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\n(1,6) has food, so head to (1,6), eat, new head (1,6), body: segment 1 to old head (1,5), segment 2 to old seg1 (2,5), ..., segment 9 to old seg8 (4,3), and add new segment at old tail (4,4), so new snake: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nLength 12, head at (1,6), direction up.\n\nNow, from here, we can consider eating (2,4) later or other food.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is below (1,5), etc.\n\nBut we are at (1,6), which is near the top-left corner.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut U to (1,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5): (1,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nL to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6): (2,6) should be free.\n\nSo only possible move R to (2,6).\n\nMust move right to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 47: move R to (2,6), no food there, so snake moves.\n\nNew head (2,6), direction right.\n\nThen body shifts: segment 1 to (1,6), segment 2 to (1,5), etc., tail moves from (4,4) to (4,3)? Old positions: head (1,6) move to (2,6), segment 1 to (1,6), segment 2 to (1,5), segment 3 to (2,5), ..., up to segment 11 to (4,3), and tail (4,4) moves to old seg10 position? List:\n\nOld before move: head (1,6), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (4,3), seg11 (4,4) tail? Snake has 12 segments: positions (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nIndex 0: (1,6) head, 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,4) tail.\n\nMove to (2,6): no food, so new head (2,6), then seg1 to old head (1,6), seg2 to old seg1 (1,5), seg3 to old seg2 (2,5), seg4 to old seg3 (3,5), seg5 to old seg4 (4,5), seg6 to old seg5 (5,5), seg7 to old seg6 (5,4), seg8 to old seg7 (6,4), seg9 to old seg8 (6,3), seg10 to old seg9 (5,3), seg11 to old seg10 (4,3), and tail old (4,4) not moved to, so removed? No, the last segment moves to old seg10 position.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nLength 12, no change since no food eaten.\n\nNow head at (2,6), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5): but (2,5) is body segment? Positions: (2,6) head, (1,6) body, (1,5) body, (2,5) body, so (2,5) is occupied, collision.\n\nL to (1,6): (1,6) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,6): (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nOh no! Only possible moves: U, D, L, R all invalid or cause collision.\n\nU: wall\n\nD: to (2,5) which is body segment (index 3 in positions, (2,5))\n\nL: to (1,6) body\n\nR: to (3,6) wall\n\nSo no valid move! Snake is trapped and dies on next turn.\n\nThis is a disaster.\n\nBecause after eating (1,6) and moving to (2,6), we are stuck.\n\nTherefore, going to (1,6) leads to a dead end.\n\nWe should avoid that.\n\nIf at turn 45 we move to (2,6) instead of (1,5).\n\nTurn 44: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 45: move U to (2,6) from (2,5)\n\n(2,6) no food, so move to (2,6), head new (2,6), body: seg1 to old head (2,5), seg2 to old seg1 (3,5), ..., tail to (4,4)\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 46: from (2,6), we can move L to (1,6) to eat the food.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent, so move left to (1,6), eat.\n\nThen new head (1,6), etc.\n\nBut after that, same problem: from (1,6), only move is R to (2,6), but (2,6) will be body after move.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 46:\n\nHead to (1,6), eat, so new head (1,6), body: seg1 to old head (2,6), seg2 to old seg1 (2,5), ..., add new segment at old tail (4,4)\n\nOld positions before turn 46: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move left to (1,6) and eat:\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Seg1: to old head (2,6)\n\n- Seg2: to old seg1 (2,5)\n\n- Seg3: to old seg2 (3,5)\n\n- ...\n\n- Seg10: to old seg9 (4,3)  // old seg9: (4,3)?

Cannot eat.\n\nSo give up on (1,6).\n\nFocus on (2,4) eaten, now go for (6,2).\n\nFrom (2,4), we can move D to (2,3) to start going down.\n\nTurn 46: move D to (2,3)\n\nNo food, so new head (2,3), direction down.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)?

Old positions: head (2,3), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,3): head (3,3), seg1 to (2,3), seg2 to (2,4), seg3 to (2,5), seg4 to (3,5), seg5 to (4,5), seg6 to (5,5), seg7 to (5,4), seg8 to (6,4), seg9 to (6,3), seg10 to (5,3)  // and (4,3) gone.\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nTurn 48: move R to (4,3)  // (4,3) is free now\n\nNo food, move to (4,3), new head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\nOld tail (5,3) moved to (6,3)? Old positions: head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3), seg10 (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,3): head (4,3), seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (2,3), seg3 to (2,4), seg4 to (2,5), seg5 to (3,5), seg6 to (4,5), seg7 to (5,5), seg8 to (5,4), seg9 to (6,4), seg10 to (6,3)  // and (5,3) gone.\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nNow, (6,2) is below (6,3), so from (4,3), we can move down to (4,2) or right to (5,3), etc.\n\nTurn 49: from (4,3), move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is free, (4,2) free.\n\nThen we can go to (5,3), then (6,3) but (6,3) is tail, so move to (6,3) on turn 50, then to (6,2) on turn 51 to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) life span 9 at turn 44, so at turn 51 it is still there? Turn 44: life 9, present turns 44 to 52, so turn 51 ok.\n\nBut let's not list all.\n\nFor the answer, I think we need to provide actions for the next few turns.\n\nSince the AI is to play, we can output a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut for this response, provide actions for turns 44 to 48 or so.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 44, moving D to (3,4) might be better because it avoids the top row.\n\nIf move D at turn 44 to (3,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 45 move L to (2,4) eat food.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction left.\n\nPositions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nThen turn 46: from (2,4), move D to (2,3) or L to (1,4) or U to (2,5) etc.\n\nMove D to (2,3) to go down.\n\nThen similar path.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nTo maximize score, we ate one food, and can eat another later.\n\nBut (1,6) can be eaten if we go directly, but it's risky.\n\nSince life span of (1,6) is short, and we might not reach it safely, better to skip it.\n\nSo for turn 44, move L to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 45, move D to (2,4) to eat.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, move down and right towards (6,2).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 46: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 47: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 48: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 49: move D to (4,2)\n\nThen later to (5,2), (6,2) etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be free.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 48, after moving to (4,3), we can move to (4,2) or (5,3).\n\nBut let's not specify too far.\n\nFor the answer, provide 5 turns: 44 to 48.\n\nBut at turn 44, action for turn 44, then turn 45, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: L (left to (2,5))\n\nTurn 45: D (down to (2,4), eat food)\n\nTurn 46: D (down to (2,3))\n\nTurn 47: R (right to (3,3))\n\nTurn 48: R (right to (4,3))\n\nThen the snake is moving towards the bottom-right.\n\nWe can eat (6,2) later.\n\nTo be safe, avoid the (1,6) area.\n\nSo I think this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (2,4) with a life span of 6, which can be safely consumed on turn 45. This food is chosen because it has sufficient remaining life (disappearing after turn 49) and is reachable without immediate risk. The food at (1,6) with a short life span (disappearing after turn 46) is avoided due to the high risk of trapping the snake in the top-left corner, as analyzed in the thought process. The food at (6,2) has a long life span (disappearing after turn 52) and will be targeted after securing (2,4), but the sequence focuses on the first 5 turns for this response.\n\nThe actions for turns 44 to 48 are planned as follows:\n- **Turn 44 (current turn)**: Move left (L) to (2,5). This positions the snake closer to (2,4) while avoiding the risk of moving down into a potential body collision or dead end. Current direction is left, so moving left is valid (not an instant reverse).\n- **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (2,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 11). This is safe as (2,4) is unoccupied and not adjacent to the tail in a dangerous way.\n- **Turn 46**: Move down (D) to (2,3). This continues the path downward to open space and avoid the congested area, preparing to head toward (6,2) later.\n- **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (3,3). This shifts the snake rightward into a safer central area, away from walls and obstacles.\n- **Turn 48**: Move right (R) to (4,3). This further progresses toward the bottom-right where (6,2) is located, and the move is safe as (4,3) may be the tail cell but tail movement prevents collision.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one food, avoids short-life high-risk food, and navigates toward open areas for future turns. Beyond turn 48, the snake should continue toward (6,2) for additional points, but the immediate 5-turn plan minimizes risks and sets up for long-term survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 44: L  \nTurn 45: D  \nTurn 46: D  \nTurn 47: R  \nTurn 48: R  \n}",

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to account for the internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t=45.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,5), then body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). Let me list these out to understand the snake's shape.\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nSegment 1: (3,5)\n\nSegment 2: (4,5)\n\nSegment 3: (5,5)\n\nSegment 4: (5,4)\n\nSegment 5: (6,4)\n\nSegment 6: (6,3)\n\nSegment 7: (5,3)\n\nSegment 8: (4,3)\n\nSegment 9: (4,4)  // tail\n\nThe snake has 10 segments. Positions are from index 0 to 9, with 0 being head.\n\nHead direction is left (L), so the snake is moving left. Last move was to the left, since head is at (2,5) and previous position was (3,5), so yes, moving left.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Good.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: rows y from 0 to 7, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, playable x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is on the top row, y=6.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail: (4,4)\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,4), (6,2)\n\n(1,6): x=1, y=6. But y=6 is the top row, and there's an obstacle at (3,6), but (1,6) is not blocked, I think. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so (1,6) should be accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is at x=2,y=4, and (6,2) at x=6,y=2.\n\nLife spans: food at (1,6) has life 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn. So at turn 45, life=3, so it will be gone by turn 48? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, a food with life span L will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or at the start of turn t + L?\n\nIt says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for a food spawned at some turn, at that turn, life_span=N, countdown=N.\n\nAfter one turn, countdown=N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nBut in this case, for turn t=45, food at (1,6) has life_span=3, so:\n\n- At turn 45: countdown=3\n\n- Turn 46: countdown=2\n\n- Turn 47: countdown=1\n\n- Turn 48: countdown=0, disappears before turn 48 or after? I think it disappears at the end of turn 47, when countdown reaches 0? Let's see the wording.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's common to have the food disappear after N turns from appearance, meaning it is available for N turns.\n\nFor example, life_span=3: available on turns t, t+1, t+2; gone at turn t+3.\n\nWith countdown: at turn t, countdown=N; after turn, countdown=N-1; when countdown=0, it disappears.\n\nAt the start of turn, if countdown >0, food is there; after the turn, if countdown was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nBut for movement and eating, we consider the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\nI think for simplicity, we can think that at the beginning of turn t, the food is present if countdown >0, and after the move, if head eats it, it's consumed, then countdown decreases or something.\n\nThe rules don't specify when exactly it disappears relative to the turn.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know for how many turns the food will be available.\n\nFood at (1,6): life_span=3 at turn 45, so it will be available on turn 45, 46, 47. After turn 47, it disappears, so not available on turn 48.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): life_span=5, available on turns 45 to 49 (since 5 turns: 45,46,47,48,49)\n\n(6,2): life_span=8, available turns 45 to 52.\n\nNow, current head position (2,5), moving left, so last direction was left.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): since head direction is L, but I can choose to move U, D, L, R, except no instant reverse. Current head direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn.\n\nHead direction is given as the direction it was moving to reach the current position, I think.\n\n\"Snake Head Direction: L\" and positions: head at (2,5), previous was (3,5), so it moved left to (2,5), so direction is left. So for the next move, I cannot move right, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but not opposite to current direction, so cannot R.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,6)\n\n- D: to (2,4)\n\n- L: to (1,5)\n\n- R: to (3,5) but cannot, because opposite direction.\n\nR is right, which is opposite to left, so invalid. So only U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each option for the next move, and think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: (2,4) is one of the options, D to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) has food, positive, value 1.\n\nIf I move to (2,4), I eat the food, snake grows by one, so new tail will be added.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from (2,5):\n\n- U: (2,6) - is this valid? y=6, but walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), but (2,6) is not (3,6), so should be free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is tail.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,4), (6,2)\n\n(2,4) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake has positions: (2,5), (3,5), etc., no (2,4) in snake, so it's free for food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) and (6,2) not occupied.\n\nNow, for move U to (2,6):\n\n- Is (2,6) a wall? Walls are at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (3,6). (2,6) is x=2,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, so ok.\n\n- Is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head (2,5), body from (3,5) to (4,4). (2,6) not in list, so free.\n\n- But there is food at (1,6), not at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (1,6), not (2,6).\n\nSo moving to (2,6) is safe, no food, so no growth.\n\nMove D to (2,4):\n\n- (2,4) is a food position, with positive food.\n\n- Is it safe to move there? Need to check if it causes collision.\n\n(2,4) is not occupied by snake body currently, as snake is at (2,5), etc., no (2,4).\n\nAfter moving, the head goes to (2,4), and since it eats food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail.\n\nCurrent tail is (4,4), so after eating, the new snake will have head at (2,4), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) remains, but since it grows, the tail stays, so positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (4,3), and (4,4) is still there? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, it grows, so the segment count increases.\n\nCurrent positions: 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4) and eating food, head moves to (2,4), and a new segment is added at the tail position. So the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new tail is added? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If no food eaten, tail moves away from its position. If food eaten, tail stays, so the snake grows by one; the position where tail was is now part of body, and tail is the same as before, but since it grows, the last segment doesn't move.\n\nLet's think:\n\n- Before move: segments S0 (head) to S9 (tail)\n\n- Move to new cell: new head position.\n\n- If no food, then new segments: new head, S0 becomes body part, S1 to S8, and S9 is removed (tail moves).\n\n- If food eaten, then new segments: new head, S0 to S9, and S9 is still tail, but since it didn't move, it's like adding a new segment at tail.\n\nIn terms of positions: after move with growth, the snake has all previous positions plus the new head position, so the tail position is the same as before, but now it's a body segment, not tail, and the new tail is the segment that was second last or something.\n\nEasier: the snake positions are updated by adding the new head and removing the tail only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail not removed.\n\nSo here, current positions: P = [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nIf move to (2,4) and eat food: new head is (2,4), so new positions: [(2,4)] + P, but P is the list, so [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]  so 11 positions, tail is (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) was tail, now it's body, and new tail is (4,4)? No, in the list, head is first, tail last.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then previous head (2,5) is now neck, then (3,5), etc., down to (4,4) which is now the second last, and the last is still (4,4)? No, the tail was (4,4), and it stays, so in new positions, (4,4) is included, and since we add head, the list has 11 elements, with tail being (4,4), which is now a body segment.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied twice? No: in the new list, positions are: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (4,4) is the last position, tail. But previously, (4,4) was tail, and now it's still tail, but the snake has grown, so it's fine, no self-collision because we moved.\n\nNow, is there collision? New head at (2,4), which was not occupied before, so no collision. Body positions: (2,5) was head, now body, but head moved away, so (2,5) is now body, but new head is at (2,4), which is different.\n\n(2,4) was free, so no problem.\n\nBut I need to check if moving to (2,4) causes any immediate collision. (2,4) is not wall, not snake body, so ok.\n\nHowever, there is a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,4), which has no food; the food is at (2,4), which is where head is moving to, not the tail cell.\n\nTail cell is (4,4), no food. Head is moving to (2,4), which has food, but tail is not adjacent to head; head at (2,5), tail at (4,4), which are not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (4,4) are not adjacent; (2,5) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells: for (x,y), adjacent are (x±1,y) and (x,y±1).\n\nSo head (2,5) adjacent to (1,5), (3,5), (2,6), (2,4).\n\nTail (4,4) adjacent to (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4)? (5,4) is in snake, etc.\n\nBut (2,5) and (4,4) are not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue with tail reward danger here.\n\nTherefore, moving to (2,4) is safe and I eat the food, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nNow, move L to (1,5):\n\n(1,5) is within bounds, x=1 not wall (walls at x=0), y=5 ok. Not occupied by snake, no food at (1,5), food at (1,6) not here. So safe move, no food eaten.\n\nNow, move U to (2,6): (2,6) is free, no food, so safe.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn 45:\n\n- U: to (2,6)\n\n- D: to (2,4) and eat food\n\n- L: to (1,5)\n\nR is invalid.\n\nNow, for each, I need to simulate future turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nBut that might be messy; I should evaluate the risks and opportunities.\n\nFirst, food availability:\n\n- Food at (1,6): life span 3, available turns 45,46,47. After turn 47, gone.\n\n- Food at (2,4): life span 5, available turns 45 to 49.\n\n- Food at (6,2): life span 8, available turns 45 to 52.\n\nAt turn 45, I can eat (2,4) by moving down.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or disappear.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nNow, let's see the snake's position. The snake is currently in a sort of loop or something.\n\nPositions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3), etc.\n\nIf I plot:\n\ny=6: ... but (3,6) obstacle, so row y=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6 blocked), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — but food at (1,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5 H), (3,5 B), (4,5 B), (5,5 B), (6,5) — (6,5) free? Snake has (5,5) and (5,4), not (6,5)\n\nList free cells.\n\nBut for planning.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I eat food, snake grows, new head at (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow, head at (2,4), and I just moved down from (2,5), so new head direction down.\n\nThen for next turn, I can move from there.\n\nBut let's think about the tail food danger later.\n\nFirst, option D: eat at (2,4) now.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, might be more constrained.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5), then head at (1,5), moved left, so direction left.\n\nThen I can go to (1,6) to eat food, since (1,6) is above, adjacent.\n\n(1,5) to (1,6) is up.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can go to (1,6) left, or (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, or (3,6) obstacle, or (2,5) down, but (2,5) is now body.\n\nAfter move, positions change.\n\nI need to simulate turn by turn for each choice.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns, and the grid is small, I can outline paths.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, the snake is quite long, 10 segments, on a 6x6 grid minus obstacle, so 36 cells minus snake 10, so 26 free, but with food.\n\nAfter eating, 11 segments, 25 free.\n\nBut walls reduce playable area.\n\nPlayable cells: x1-6, y1-6 except (3,6), so 6*6=36 minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 10, so 25 free cells including food positions.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,4), (6,2) are three of them.\n\nNow, let's consider the choices for turn 45.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,4) - eat food, grow to 11 segments. New head direction down.\n\nThen at turn 46, from (2,4), head direction down, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,4), D to (2,3), R to (3,4), U invalid.\n\nNow, (1,4) - is it free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\n(2,3) - free? Snake has (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc, no (2,3), so free.\n\n(3,4) - (3,4) is not in snake positions, snake has (3,5), (4,5), etc, not (3,4), so free.\n\nNo food at these positions, food at (1,6), (6,2), and (2,4) eaten.\n\n(2,4) food is eaten, so gone.\n\nSo all moves safe, no food.\n\nBut I might want to go towards other food.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,6), from (2,4), I can go left to (1,4), then up to (1,5) or (1,6)? (1,4) to (1,5) up, or to (1,3) down, etc.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5), (2,6), (0,6) wall, etc.\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (1,6), I need to go left and up, but directly from (2,4), I can go to (1,4) then to (1,5) then to (1,6), or to (2,5) but (2,5) is body now.\n\nAfter eating at (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, so from (2,4), moving to (2,5) would be body collision, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,4), (2,3), or (3,4) are safe.\n\nNow, (1,6) food has life span 3, available only until turn 47, so I have until turn 47 to eat it.\n\nTurn 45: if I eat (2,4), turn 46 and 47 left to eat (1,6).\n\nFrom (2,4), on turn 46, I can move to (1,4) L, or to (2,3) D, or to (3,4) R.\n\nIf I go to (1,4), then head at (1,4), direction left.\n\nThen turn 47, from (1,4), can move U to (1,5), or D to (1,3), or L to (0,4) wall invalid, or R to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body? After turn 46, if I move to (1,4), positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., tail (4,4)\n\n(2,4) is body.\n\nSo from (1,4), moving to (2,4) would be body collision, invalid.\n\nMoving to (1,5) U: (1,5) is free? Previously, if I didn't move there, it should be free. At turn 46, positions: after move to (1,4), body includes (2,4), (2,5), etc, (1,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nThen to (1,6) from (1,5) on turn 47.\n\nTurn 47: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\n(1,6) is available until turn 47, so on turn 47 it can be eaten.\n\nThen snake grows again.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 45.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I eat food, then I can potentially go to (1,6) in two moves: turn 46 to (1,4), turn 47 to (1,5), then turn 48 to (1,6) but (1,6) disappears after turn 47? Life span 3 at turn 45, so:\n\nTurn 45: countdown=3, available\n\nTurn 46: countdown=2, available\n\nTurn 47: countdown=1, available\n\nTurn 48: countdown=0, disappears, not available.\n\nSo on turn 47, it is available, I can eat it on turn 47.\n\nIf I go to (1,4) on turn 46, then to (1,5) on turn 47, then I can eat (1,6) on turn 47 by moving up from (1,5).\n\nBut from (1,5) to (1,6) is up.\n\nNow, is (1,6) safe to eat? When I move to (1,6), it should be free, and no collision.\n\nBut I need to check if tail is adjacent or something for tail reward danger, but that's only if the food is on tail cell, not here.\n\nFood at (1,6) is not on tail.\n\nSo possible.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I move directly to (1,4) on turn 46, then to (1,5) on turn 47, then to (1,6) on turn 47? Turn 47: from (1,5) to (1,6), yes.\n\nBut on turn 47, I move to (1,6) and eat.\n\nNow, but on turn 46, when I move to (1,4), head at (1,4), direction left.\n\nThen turn 47, from (1,4), I can move to (1,5) U, which is valid, no opposite issue.\n\nThen to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, which is the top row, but not wall.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (3,6), but not affecting.\n\nSo this path allows me to eat two foods: (2,4) on turn 45 and (1,6) on turn 47.\n\nThen I have (6,2) food with longer life.\n\nBut the snake is growing, now 12 segments after eating (1,6), but let's see.\n\nAfter turn 45: eat (2,4), snake 11 segments.\n\nAfter turn 47: eat (1,6), snake 12 segments.\n\nThen I can go for (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) has life until turn 52, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, what about other options for turn 45.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (1,5) on turn 45.\n\nThen head at (1,5), moved left, so direction left.\n\nThen I can go to (1,6) on turn 46 to eat food.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent, up from (1,5).\n\nSo turn 46: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut on turn 45, when I move to (1,5), no food eaten, since no food at (1,5).\n\nPositions after turn 45 move to (1,5): head to (1,5), tail (4,4) removed, since no growth, so new positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]  tail is (4,3)? Previous positions: head was (2,5), moved to (1,5), so new head (1,5), then previous segments: (2,5) now body, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail was (4,4), but since no growth, tail removed, so positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — 10 segments, tail at (4,3).\n\n(4,4) is no longer part of snake.\n\nThen turn 46: from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) to eat food (since (1,6) has food), or D to (1,4), or R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, collision, invalid, or L to (0,5) wall invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (1,6): eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail. 11 segments.\n\nD to (1,4): no food, positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., tail removed, so (4,3) gone, tail now (5,3) or something.\n\nBut if I move U, I eat (1,6) on turn 46.\n\n(1,6) is available until turn 47, so turn 46 is fine.\n\nThen I have eaten (1,6), but not (2,4) yet.\n\n(2,4) is still there, available until turn 49.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), head at (1,6), direction up (since moved up from (1,5)).\n\nThen I can go down to (1,5) but body, or left/right, but (1,6) is corner, x=1,y=6.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,5) but body collision, invalid; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6); U to (1,7) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) should be free, no food.\n\nThen move to (2,6), no food eaten.\n\nHead at (2,6), direction right.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) but body, or (3,6) obstacle, or (2,7) wall, or (1,6) body, so only down to (2,5)? (2,5) is body, invalid.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6) on turn 46, positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc. down to (4,3) tail.\n\nFrom (2,6), adjacent cells: (1,6) body, (3,6) obstacle, (2,5) body, (2,7) wall. All invalid except (2,5) but body, so no possible move? That would be death.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) on turn 46, head at (1,6), only possible move is to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 47, from (2,6), the only adjacent cells are: (1,6) - occupied by body, (3,6) - obstacle, (2,5) - occupied by body (since (2,5) is the second segment), (2,7) - wall. So all four directions blocked, snake dies.\n\nOh, so if I go to (1,6) and eat, then I get stuck and die on the next turn.\n\nBecause (1,6) is a corner with limited escape.\n\nSpecifically, after moving to (1,6), the body is at (1,5) and (2,5), blocking the down and right? From (1,6), down is (1,5), which is body, right is (2,6), which might be free, but in this case, (2,6) is free only if I move there.\n\nBut after moving to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nSo from (1,6), moving to (1,5) is body collision, invalid; moving to (2,6) is possible, as I said.\n\nThen after moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nNow from (2,6), the cells: (1,6) is body, (3,6) is obstacle, (2,5) is body (since (2,5) is part of body), (2,7) wall. So indeed, no safe move from (2,6), snake dies.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (1,6) when the snake is in this configuration, I die immediately after or get trapped.\n\nTherefore, it is dangerous to eat (1,6) now because of the position.\n\nIn option 1, when I ate (2,4) first, I planned to go to (1,4) then (1,5) then (1,6), but when I go to (1,5) and then to (1,6), I might have the same issue.\n\nLet's see in that path.\n\nIn option 1: turn 45 move D to (2,4), eat, head at (2,4), direction down.\n\nTurn 46 move L to (1,4), no food, head at (1,4), direction left.\n\nPositions: after turn 46, head (1,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail? Let's list: after turn 45: positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 46 move to (1,4), no food, so tail removed, new positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — tail is (4,3)\n\n(4,4) removed.\n\nNow head at (1,4), direction left.\n\nTurn 47: move U to (1,5), no food? (1,5) has no food, so move to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)? After move, head to (1,5), tail removed, so positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail (6,3)\n\n(5,3) was tail, removed.\n\nNow head at (1,5), direction up (since moved up from (1,4)).\n\nThen I can move to (1,6) to eat food on turn 47.\n\nMove U to (1,6), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) and since growth, tail not removed, so tail is (6,3), but now (1,6) added, so positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) 11 segments, tail (6,3).\n\nNow, from (1,6), possible moves: D to (1,5) but body, invalid; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6); U to (1,7) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free? Not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nMove to (2,6), no food eaten.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail (6,4)? After move, no growth, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail (5,4) — (6,4) removed? Let's see: previous tail was (6,3), but in positions before move: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail (6,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), no food, so add (2,6), remove tail (6,3), so new positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail (5,4)\n\n(6,4) and (6,3) are gone, (6,4) was second last? In the list, before move: index 0: (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), new head (2,6), then segments 0 to 9 become body, so (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,3) is removed. So positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — 10 segments, tail (5,4)\n\nNow from (2,6), head position, possible moves: (1,6) body, invalid; (3,6) obstacle; (2,5) body ( (2,5) is in positions); (2,7) wall. All invalid except (2,5) but body, so again, no possible move, snake dies.\n\nSame problem!\n\nTherefore, in both cases, if I eat (1,6), I end up trapped at (2,6) with no escape.\n\nBecause the body blocks all exits.\n\nTherefore, it seems that eating (1,6) is risky and leads to death.\n\nI should avoid eating (1,6) at all, or only if I can escape.\n\nBut in this position, with the snake body, it's hard to escape from (1,6).\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (1,6) at all, since it expires soon and is dangerous.\n\nThen, for turn 45, moving down to (2,4) might not be good because it tempts me to go for (1,6) which is fatal.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), I can choose not to go for (1,6), but go other ways.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,4), head at (2,4), I can move down to (2,3) or right to (3,4), etc., avoiding the top row.\n\nThen (1,6) will disappear after turn 47, uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (2,4) now, I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nOption for turn 45: move U to (2,6)\n\nThen head at (2,6), no food eaten, since no food there.\n\nMoved up, so direction up.\n\nThen positions: after move, no growth, so tail removed.\n\nCurrent before move: head (2,5), body to (4,4)\n\nMove to (2,6), new head (2,6), then previous positions except tail: so (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and tail (4,4) removed, so positions: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction up.\n\nNow possible moves from (2,6): U to (2,7) wall invalid; D to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, invalid; L to (1,6); R to (3,6) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) has food, so I can eat it on turn 46.\n\nMove to (1,6), eat food.\n\nThen positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and since growth, tail not removed, so tail (4,3)? New positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) 11 segments, tail (4,3)\n\nNow from (1,6), as before, only possible move is R to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision! (2,6) is the second segment, so moving to (2,6) is body collision, invalid.\n\nOther directions invalid, so trapped, die.\n\nWorse, I eat and die immediately.\n\nSo moving to (2,6) on turn 45 forces me to go to (1,6) and get trapped.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (2,6) is also bad.\n\nThe only safe move from turn 45 might be to move left to (1,5) or down to (2,4) but avoid (1,6).\n\nLet's consider moving left to (1,5) on turn 45.\n\nMove L to (1,5), no food, head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3) — (4,4) removed.\n\nNow, from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) to eat, but as we saw, that leads to death, or D to (1,4), or R to (2,5) but body, invalid, L invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), eat, then as before, only move to (2,6), then trapped at (2,6).\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), no food, then head at (1,4), direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, (1,4) to (1,3) or (2,4) or (1,5) etc.\n\n(2,4) has food, so I can go to (2,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 46: from (1,5), move D to (1,4), positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)? After move, no growth, tail removed: previous tail (4,3) removed, so positions (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3) — (5,3) is last.\n\n(6,3) and (5,3) are both, but (6,3) is before (5,3)? List: after move to (1,4): head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3)\n\nHead at (1,4), direction down.\n\nTurn 47: from (1,4), can move L to (0,4) wall invalid; R to (2,4); U to (1,5) body invalid; D to (1,3).\n\nSo only R or D.\n\nIf I move R to (2,4), (2,4) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nPositions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) and growth, tail not removed, so tail (5,3), new segments 11.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction right.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (2,3), (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) food expires after turn 47, so I can't eat it anymore.\n\nI ate (2,4) on turn 47.\n\nNow, I have (6,2) food to eat.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the top row entirely.\n\nAnother option: on turn 45, move down to (2,4), eat, then instead of going left, go down or right.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) on turn 45, move D to (2,3) on turn 46.\n\n(2,3) is free, no food.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2), (1,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, I can later go to (6,2) to eat.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for (6,2).\n\nFirst, I need to choose a move for turn 45 that avoids death.\n\nFrom above, moving U to (2,6) or moving L to (1,5) with the intent to go U are dangerous because of (1,6).\n\nMoving D to (2,4) is safe immediately, but if I go for (1,6), it's bad, but I can choose not to.\n\nMoving directly L to (1,5) and then D to (1,4) is safe, as above.\n\nOr moving D to (2,4) and then D to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\nBut let's consider the food at (2,4). If I don't eat it now, it has life span 5, so I can eat it later, but the snake might be in different position.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating is good, but survival first.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,2) with long life.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,2) directly.\n\nBut from current position (2,5), moving down to (2,4) eats it, which is on the way.\n\n(2,4) is south of (2,5), (6,2) is south-west.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving down to (2,4) is towards (6,2), sort of.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move down to (2,3), then (2,2), then left or right to (6,2)? (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, so from (2,2) I can go right to (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nCurrent body: the snake has segments at (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,3) and (5,3) are at y=3, so if I go down to y=2, it might be free.\n\nLet's list free cells or plan a path.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should avoid the top row and focus on the bottom.\n\nSince (1,6) is dangerous to eat, I should let it expire.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) I can eat later.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current and future turns? No, the answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns; it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I think I need to provide a sequence of actions for the next few turns, but it might be open-ended.\n\nBut in the context, I should provide the actions for the next 5 turns or so, as an example.\n\nBut I need to decide the first action.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a plan.\n\nBut let's choose the safest move.\n\nOption: move down to (2,4) on turn 45, eat food, then on turn 46, move down to (2,3), avoiding the left top area.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nThen later to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), then I can go to (2,4) to eat later.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4) on turn 45, I get the food immediately, snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but on a 6x6 grid, with 35 cells, 11 segments is ok.\n\nIf I don't eat now, snake is shorter, easier to move, but I miss the opportunity; but since (2,4) has life 5, I can eat it in the next few turns.\n\nSimilarly for (6,2).\n\nBut (1,6) I should avoid.\n\nSo for turn 45, I think moving left to (1,5) is safe, and I can then go down to (1,4), then to (2,4) to eat on turn 47 or something.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 45: move L to (1,5)  -- no food, head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nTurn 46: move D to (1,4)  -- no food, head at (1,4), direction down.\n\nPositions after turn 46: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3) -- (4,3) removed earlier, but in this case, after turn 45 move to (1,5), positions (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nAfter turn 46 move to (1,4), no food, so new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3) -- (4,3) removed.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction down.\n\nTurn 47: move R to (2,4)  -- (2,4) has food, eat, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) and growth, tail not removed, so tail (5,3), new segments 11.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction right.\n\nNow, (1,6) food expires after this turn, so not available.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (2,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nFor example, move to (2,3) on turn 48.\n\nBut (6,2) food is at (6,2), so I need to go there.\n\nFrom (2,4), move D to (2,3) on turn 48.\n\n(2,3) free, no food.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction down.\n\nThen move R to (3,3) on turn 49, etc., towards (6,2).\n\nBut there might be body, but y=3 has body at (6,3), (5,3), etc., but as I move, the tail moves, so paths open up.\n\nSince I ate on turn 47, snake is long, but I can navigate.\n\nIf on turn 45 I move D to (2,4), eat, then on turn 46 move D to (2,3), no food.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction down.\n\nThen on turn 47 move D to (2,2), no food.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen I can move R to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) to eat on turn 50 or something.\n\n(6,2) has life until turn 52, so ok.\n\nAnd (2,4) is eaten on turn 45.\n\nIn this case, I eat (2,4) early and go down.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat (2,4) on turn 47.\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nBut in the move left plan, I avoid the danger of (1,6).\n\nSince moving up or towards (1,6) is dangerous, moving down or left is safer.\n\nNow, another food at (6,2), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4) or after moves.\n\nBut let's check if eating (6,2) could have tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but food is on cells, not necessarily on tail.\n\nWhen I eat food at a cell, it's consumed, so the tail cell may not have food.\n\nTail reward danger is only if the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision because after growth, tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide if adjacent.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's when the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it while adjacent.\n\nIn this case, for (6,2), it's not on tail, tail is at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nSo for (6,2), it should be safe to eat.\n\nNow, back to turn 45 action.\n\nI think both moving L or D are possible, but moving D to (2,4) allows me to eat now, which might be better for score, but survival first.\n\nSince (2,4) is available, and I can eat it safely, I should.\n\nMoving to (2,4) on turn 45.\n\nThen for turn 46, I should not go left to avoid (1,6), so move down to (2,3) or right to (3,4).\n\nIf I move right to (3,4), for example.\n\n(3,4) is free, no food.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction right.\n\nThen I can go down or up, etc.\n\nBut let's provide a sequence.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should output for a few turns.\n\nBut the answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I need to start with turn 45.\n\nI think moving down to eat (2,4) is fine, then move down to (2,3) to avoid the top.\n\nThen from there, head towards (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) will expire uneaten, which is fine.\n\nSo let's outline:\n\nTurn 45: move D to (2,4)  // eat food\n\nThen turn 46: from (2,4), move D to (2,3)  // no food\n\nHead at (2,3), direction down.\n\nTurn 47: move D to (2,2)  // no food, assuming (2,2) free\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 48: move R to (3,2)  // no food\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2)  // no food\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2)  // no food\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2)  // eat food at (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) has life until turn 52, so on turn 51 it is available.\n\nAlso, need to check if cells are free.\n\nFor example, at turn 47, head at (2,2), snake positions will change over time.\n\nBut since the snake is moving, and tail is moving, cells should free up.\n\nFor instance, the tail was at (4,4) initially, but after moves, it moves.\n\nIn this path, I might be fine.\n\nTo be safer, I could move directly towards (6,2) after eating (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,4), instead of down, move right to (3,4), then down to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (6,2) is at (6,2), so I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (2,4), move R to (3,4) on turn 46.\n\nThen turn 47 move D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, so for the response, I should output a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince turn 45, output for turn 45 to 50, for example.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nAnother thing: in the current state, if I move left to (1,5), I don't eat, but I can eat later.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might be better, but not critical.\n\nI think moving down to (2,4) is acceptable.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid (2,4) for now to keep snake shorter, but since all food is positive, eating is good.\n\nI think D is ok.\n\nBut let's see the head direction; after moving D, new direction down.\n\nThen for turn 46, from (2,4), I can move D, L, R, not U.\n\nL to (1,4), R to (3,4), D to (2,3).\n\nIf I move L to (1,4), then I might be tempted to go to (1,5) and (1,6), which is dangerous, so better to move D or R.\n\nMove D to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), move to (2,2), etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nThen turn 46: D\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, for turn 47, from (2,3), move D to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince the food at (1,6) expires soon, and it's dangerous, I should not include it in the plan.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) can be eaten later if not now.\n\nBut let's choose to move left on turn 45 to avoid risk.\n\nMove L to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 46 move D to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 47 move R to (2,4) to eat.\n\nThen from there, go down.\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 47.\n\nIn the first case, I eat on turn 45.\n\nScore-wise, same, one point.\n\nBut in D move, I eat earlier.\n\nSurvival same.\n\nI think D is better.\n\nFinal decision: move D on turn 45.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: D  // to (2,3)\n\nTurn 47: D  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 48: R  // to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: R  // to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: R  // to (5,2)\n\nThen on turn 51, move R to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut turn 50 to (5,2), then turn 51 to (6,2).\n\nNow, for the boxed answer, I need to output for current and future turns.\n\nSince it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" I think I can output for as many as I want, but at least the first action.\n\nTo be complete, let's say for 5 turns: turn 45 to 50.\n\nTurn 50 is t1+5? t1=45, t1+1=46, t1+2=47, t1+3=48, t1+4=49, t1+5=50.\n\nSo 6 actions.\n\nBut I can do that.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 48 to 50, moving right, but I need to ensure cells are free.\n\nFor example, at turn 45, after move D, positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nTurn 46 move D to (2,3): head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3) -- (4,4) removed.\n\nTurn 47 move D to (2,2): head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail (5,3) -- (4,3) removed? After move to (2,2), no food, so add (2,2), remove tail (4,3), so positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail (6,3) -- (5,3) removed.\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nTurn 48 move R to (3,2): (3,2) should be free, no issue.\n\nHead to (3,2), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail (6,4) -- (6,3) removed.\n\nTurn 49 move R to (4,2): (4,2) free, head (4,2), positions: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail (5,4) -- (6,4) removed.\n\nTurn 50 move R to (5,2): (5,2) free, head (5,2), positions: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail (5,5) -- (5,4) removed.\n\nThen turn 51 move R to (6,2): (6,2) has food, eat, grow.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIn this plan, I ate (2,4) on turn 45 and (6,2) on turn 51, and avoided (1,6).\n\nGood.\n\nIf I had moved left first, I would eat later, but similar.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan moves 5+ turns ahead, avoiding the dangerous (1,6) food that leads to a trapping scenario, and safely targeting the (2,4) and (6,2) foods. The (1,6) food expires soon (after turn 47) and is high-risk due to the snake's body configuration, which can cause immediate death if eaten. Therefore, the plan avoids (1,6) entirely. The (2,4) food is eaten immediately on turn 45 for a quick +1 score, and then the snake moves downward to position itself for the (6,2) food, which has a longer lifespan (available until turn 52). Moving down on turn 45 also avoids the risk associated with the top row. The sequence ensures the snake stays clear of walls, obstacles, and self-collisions while efficiently navigating toward (6,2).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (1,6): Avoid due to high risk of trapping; expires after turn 47.\n  - (2,4): Eat on turn 45 (safe and immediate reward).\n  - (6,2): Target for later consumption (lifespan until turn 52).\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - No instant reverse: After moving left (L) to (2,5) on turn 45, down (D) is chosen; from there, down moves are consistent.\n  - Collision avoidance: All moves are to free cells, with body and tail positions tracked to prevent self-collision. Tail reward danger is irrelevant here as food is not on the tail cell.\n- **5+ Turn Planning**: \n  - Turns 45-47: Eat (2,4), move down to (2,2), avoiding the top row.\n  - Turns 48-50: Move right toward (6,2), with the tail moving away to free space.\n  - Turn 51: Eat (6,2) safely (planned beyond 5 turns for completeness).\n- **Grid Analysis**: \n  - Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6, except obstacle at (3,6).\n  - After turn 45, snake grows to 11 segments; path ensures ample space for movement.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (2,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length +1). New head direction: down.\n- **Turn 46**: Move down (D) to (2,3) to continue away from risky areas. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 47**: Move down (D) to (2,2) to position for rightward movement. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 48**: Move right (R) to (3,2) toward (6,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 49**: Move right (R) to (4,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 50**: Move right (R) to (5,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 51**: Move right (R) to (6,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length +1). \n\nThis sequence eats two foods by turn 51, avoids all risks, and ensures survival. Beyond turn 51, the snake can explore remaining areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: D \\\\\nTurn 46: D \\\\\nTurn 47: D \\\\\nTurn 48: R \\\\\nTurn 49: R \\\\\nTurn 50: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 46, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,4), and the body segments follow: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 10: (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is the tail. Let me count: from (2,4) to (4,4) that's 11 positions? Positions given: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] — that's 11 segments. So snake length is 11.\n\nHead direction is D, which is down. So currently moving down, but head is at (2,4) and moving down would be to (2,3), but let's see possible moves.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\n(6,3) is also a food position, but (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (6,3), which is segment 7. But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nIn the food list, (6,3) is listed with life span 10, value 1. But since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten now; only if the snake moves away and back, but that might be risky.\n\nFirst, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction D (down). Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but cannot do instant reverse. Since current direction is D, reverse is U, so cannot move U next. So allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, check each direction for safety and food access.\n\nFirst, move D (down): to (2,3)\n\nIs (2,3) within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is between 0 and 7, x=2 between 0 and 7. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (2,3), so no wall. Now, is it occupied by snake body?\n\nSnake positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(2,3) is not in this list, so empty. But after moving, the tail will move, but for collision, we care about where head moves to and if it hits any body except the tail, since tail moves.\n\nStandard snake rules: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail leaves its position. So collision is if head hits a body segment that is not the tail position at that time, or if it hits a wall.\n\nBut here, since we're checking the new head position, we need to see if that cell is occupied by any part of the body except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, for (2,3): not in snake positions, so safe.\n\nNow, food at (2,3)? No, food is at (1,6), (6,2), (6,3). Not at (2,3), so no food.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn t=46.\n\nFood at (1,6) life span 2, so after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes 1, then 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life 7, (6,3) life 10.\n\n(6,3) is occupied by snake, so can't be eaten now.\n\nNow, move L (left): from (2,4) to (1,4)\n\n(1,4): within bounds? x=1, y=4, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so yes.\n\nIs it occupied? Snake positions: no (1,4), so empty.\n\nFood? No, food not there.\n\nMove R (right): to (3,4)\n\n(3,4): is it in snake positions? Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), etc. No (3,4), so empty.\n\nFood? No.\n\nSo all three moves are safe: D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4). None have food directly.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for future food and risks.\n\nAlso, there's food at (6,3), but snake is on it, so if snake moves away, it might be eatable later.\n\n(6,3) is segment 7, not tail. Tail is at (4,4).\n\nWhen snake moves, the tail will move to (4,3)? Let's see the movement.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nIf head moves to a new position, say (2,3), then new head is (2,3), and body segments shift: segment 1 becomes old head (2,4), segment 2 becomes (2,5), ..., segment 10 becomes (4,3), and tail segment 11 is removed or moved? In snake, when no food eaten, tail moves off, so new positions: head to new, then each body to previous position.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,3), then the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where? The body segments: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nStandard: after moving one step, the new body positions are the previous head and body except the tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSince no food eaten, length same, so tail is cut off.\n\nSo after moving down to (2,3):\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- New body: (2,4) [old head], (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // (4,4) is tail, removed, so tail now at (4,3)\n\nPositions: new head (2,3), then segments: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — that's 10 segments? Original 11 segments, head moves to new, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so new snake has 11 - 1 + 0 = 10 segments? No.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied by head, so length remains the same, but the positions shift.\n\nNumber of segments: 11 positions. After move, head to new position, say (2,3), then the body: the first body segment is at old head position (2,4), second at old first body (2,5), third at old second (3,5), ..., up to the tenth body segment at old ninth body position, and the tail (old tenth body) is at (4,3), but (4,3) was segment 9? Let's index.\n\nLet S0 = head (2,4)\n\nS1 = (2,5)\n\nS2 = (3,5)\n\nS3 = (4,5)\n\nS4 = (5,5)\n\nS5 = (5,4)\n\nS6 = (6,4)\n\nS7 = (6,3)\n\nS8 = (5,3)\n\nS9 = (4,3)\n\nS10 = (4,4)  // tail\n\nAfter moving head to new position, say new_head.\n\nThen new positions: new_head, then S0, S1, S2, ..., S9. S10 is no longer part of snake, so tail is S9, which was (4,3).\n\nSo new snake: [new_head, (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] but (4,3) was S9, so positions: new_head, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9. S10 is gone.\n\nS9 is (4,3), S8 is (5,3), etc.\n\nIn terms of cells: after move down to (2,3):\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- Then: (2,4) [old head], (2,5) [old S1], (3,5) [old S2], (4,5) [old S3], (5,5) [old S4], (5,4) [old S5], (6,4) [old S6], (6,3) [old S7], (5,3) [old S8], (4,3) [old S9]\n\nOld S10 (4,4) is removed.\n\nSo new tail is (4,3).\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut for collision, when moving to (2,3), it was empty, so no problem.\n\nNow back to current turn.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R, all safe but no immediate food.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (1,6): life span 2, so must be eaten within 2 turns, meaning on turn 46 or 47. After turn 47, if not eaten, gone. Because life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nLife span: at turn t, if life span L, it disappears after L turns, so can be eaten on turns where countdown >0.\n\nFor (1,6): life span 2 at turn 46, so can be eaten on turn 46 or 47. On turn 48, it would be gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2): life 7, can be eaten from turn 46 to 52.\n\n(6,3): life 10, turn 46 to 55.\n\nBut (6,3) is currently occupied by snake, so cannot be eaten now. Only if snake moves away and head comes back later.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is at (4,4), no food there.\n\nNow, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, obstacle at (3,6).\n\nFood: (1,6), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is under snake body.\n\nSnake head at (2,4), moving down.\n\nTo reach (1,6), which is at x=1,y=6. Current head y=4, so need to go up to y=6.\n\nBut current direction down, and cannot move up immediately because reverse not allowed.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves L to (1,4), D to (2,3), R to (3,4).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so from (1,4), I can go up to (1,5) then (1,6), but need to see if possible.\n\nBut life span is 2, so must be eaten by turn 47.\n\nTurn 46: if I move to (1,4), then turn 47 I can move to (1,5) or other, but to eat (1,6), I need to be at (1,5) or (0,6) or (2,6) or (1,7), but (1,7) is wall y=7, (0,6) wall x=0, (2,6) possible, but (1,6) adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,7), (0,6), (2,6). (1,7) and (0,6) walls, so only (1,5) and (2,6) can access (1,6).\n\nSo to eat (1,6), head must be at (1,5) or (2,6) and move to (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, from current position (2,4), if I go left to (1,4) on turn 46, then on turn 47 I can go up to (1,5), then on turn 48 I can go to (1,6), but life span: after turn 46, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1. On turn 47, if I move to (1,5), I don't eat it yet. Then on turn 48, when I move to (1,6), but life span on turn 47 was 1, after turn 47 decreases to 0, so on turn 48 it might be gone? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n\nThe rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"including current\" means when we are at turn t, the life span decreases at the end of the turn or beginning?\n\nThe description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it decreases at the start of the turn or end? Typically in such games, when it says \"disappears after N turns\", it means it can be eaten for N turns starting from when it appears.\n\nBut here it says \"life_span\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nLet's assume that at the beginning of turn t, the countdown is L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears after the turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nPerhaps: when food is spawned, it has life span N, meaning it will disappear after N more turns.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears after the turn.\n\nSo for eating, on turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten before the countdown decrease.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but I think: the food is present during the turn, and can be eaten if head moves to it. After the turn, countdown decreases.\n\nFor (1,6) at turn 46: life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47. After turn 47, countdown decreases to 0 and it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 48, it is gone.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I must move head to (1,6) on turn 46 or 47.\n\nOn turn 46, head at (2,4), not at (1,6), and I can move to (1,4), (2,3), or (3,4), none is (1,6), so I cannot eat it on turn 46.\n\nThen only chance is turn 47.\n\nOn turn 47, head must be at (1,5) or (2,6) to move to (1,6).\n\n(1,5) or (2,6).\n\nNow, where will head be on turn 47 depends on move on turn 46.\n\nIf on turn 46 I move to (1,4), then on turn 47 I can move to (1,5) or (0,4) or (1,3) or (2,4), but (0,4) wall, (1,3) down, (2,4) right.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4).\n\nSo I can go U to (1,5) on turn 47, then from (1,5) I can move to (1,6) on turn 48? Turn 47: if I move to (1,5), I can eat (1,6) on turn 48? No, to eat on turn 47, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 47, but from (1,4) on turn 46, on turn 47 I move to (1,5), which is not (1,6), so I don't eat it on turn 47.\n\nTo eat on turn 47, on turn 47 head must move to (1,6).\n\nSo on turn 47, head must be at an adjacent cell to (1,6) and move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,5), (2,6), (1,7) wall, (0,6) wall. So only (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nOn turn 46, I need to move to a position where on turn 47 I can be at (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nCurrent position (2,4) on turn 46.\n\nIf I move to (1,4) on turn 46, then on turn 47 from (1,4) I can move to (1,5), which is adjacent to (1,6), so on turn 47 I can move to (1,5), then I can move to (1,6) on turn 48, but on turn 48 it's too late, because on turn 47 after decrease, life span was 1, after turn 47 it becomes 0, so on turn 48 it is gone.\n\nLet's timeline:\n\nTurn 46: food (1,6) life span 2\n\nAfter turn 46: if not eaten, life span decreases to 1\n\nTurn 47: life span 1, can be eaten during turn 47\n\nAfter turn 47: if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears\n\nSo last chance to eat is on turn 47.\n\nOn turn 47, head must be at (1,6) to eat it.\n\nBut to be at (1,6) on turn 47, that means on turn 47, the head moves to (1,6).\n\nSo on turn 46, head must be at a cell adjacent to (1,6), so that it can move to it on turn 47.\n\nAdjacent cells to (1,6) are (1,5), (2,6), (1,7) invalid, (0,6) invalid. So only (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nOn turn 46, after move, head should be at (1,5) or (2,6) so that on turn 47 it can move to (1,6).\n\nBut on turn 46, current head at (2,4), I can move to (1,4), (2,3), or (3,4).\n\nNone of these is (1,5) or (2,6). (2,6) is far, y=6.\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (2,6) on turn 46? Impossible, because from (2,4) I can only move to adjacent cells: (1,4), (2,3), (3,4), (2,5) but cannot move up because reverse not allowed, current direction down, so U not allowed, so cannot go to (2,5).\n\nSo on turn 46, I cannot reach (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (1,6) at all, because I cannot be at an adjacent cell on turn 46 to move to it on turn 47, and on turn 46 I cannot move to it directly.\n\nSo (1,6) will disappear after turn 47 without being eaten. I should ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (6,2) and (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is currently occupied by snake body, segment at (6,3).\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\n(6,2) life span 7.\n\nSnake head at (2,4), need to get to (6,2) or (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is under body, so I need to move away and come back.\n\nFirst, let's consider the current move options.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4) with direction down: D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nI need to think which one leads to better future opportunities.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6), but not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, let's simulate each option for a few turns.\n\nFirst, option: move down to (2,3) on turn 46.\n\nThen new head at (2,3), direction now down (since moved down).\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nFood: (1,6) life span decreases to 1 after turn 46, but we can't eat it anyway.\n\n(6,2) life 7, (6,3) life 10.\n\n(6,3) is still occupied by body at (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction down, so cannot move U (up), instant reverse not allowed. So allowed: D, L, R.\n\nMove D to (2,2): within bounds, not wall, not body? New body positions: (2,3) is head, so cells occupied: (2,4), (2,5), etc, (2,2) not in, so safe. No food.\n\nMove L to (1,3): similar, safe, no food.\n\nMove R to (3,3): safe, no food.\n\nNot much gain.\n\nPerhaps I should head towards the food at (6,2) or free (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied.\n\nLet me list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is occupied by wall, so not accessible.\n\nFood at (1,6): but (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is not wall, since walls are the borders, but the cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (1,6) is corner but not wall, x=1 not 0, y=6 not 7, so it is valid cell.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) and (6,3).\n\nSnake positions: head (2,4), then (2,5) up, (3,5) right, (4,5) right, (5,5) right, (5,4) down, (6,4) right, (6,3) down, (5,3) left, (4,3) down? (4,3), (4,4) left? Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo (4,4) is tail.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the right side, head at left.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (2,4), moving right to (3,4) might be a good start.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (4,4), but (4,4) is currently tail, but when I move, tail moves.\n\nLet's think long term.\n\nAnother food at (6,3) is under the body at (6,3), which is segment, not tail.\n\nIf I move the snake away from (6,3), it will be free, and I can eat it later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut tail at (4,4), no food.\n\nNow, let's consider moving right to (3,4) on turn 46.\n\nTurn 46: move R to (3,4)\n\nNew head at (3,4), direction now right (since moved right).\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body: (2,4) [old head], (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3) since S10 (4,4) removed.\n\nOld S9 (4,3) is new tail.\n\nFood: (1,6) life span now 1 after turn 46 decrease, but can be eaten on turn 47 if possible, but head at (3,4), not adjacent to (1,6), so cannot eat on turn 47, so (1,6) will disappear.\n\n(6,2) life 7, (6,3) life 10.\n\n(6,3) is still occupied by body at (6,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction right, so cannot move L (left), instant reverse not allowed. So allowed: U, D, R.\n\nMove U to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by body? New body positions include (3,5)? Positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc. So (3,5) is occupied by the body, so if I move U to (3,5), I collide with my own body, death.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (3,3): is (3,3) occupied? Current positions: (3,4) head, (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — no (3,3), so safe.\n\nMove R to (4,4): but (4,4) is not in positions, old tail was removed, so (4,4) is free? In new positions, after move to (3,4), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — so (4,4) is not occupied, so moving to (4,4) is safe.\n\nAnd (4,4) is where the tail was, but no food, so no issue.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: D to (3,3), R to (4,4), or U but U to (3,5) is body, so not possible, L not allowed.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, if I move R to (4,4), then I am at (4,4), which is closer to the food areas.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,5) or (5,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nI need to plan to eat the food at (6,2) or (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is occupied, so I need to vacate it.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is occupied by body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move away if I don't eat food.\n\nFor example, if I move towards the right, the body might shift.\n\nLet's simulate moving right on turn 46 to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 47, from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4).\n\nMove to (4,4): new head (4,4), direction right.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail at (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nFood: (6,2) and (6,3), (6,3) still occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body? Positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — so (4,5) is occupied, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is not in positions? Positions have (5,3) but not (4,3)? Current positions: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — so (4,3) is not there, so safe.\n\nL to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is body? (5,4) is in positions, yes, occupied, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,4) is D to (4,3) or L but L not allowed, U and R occupied, so only D to (4,3).\n\nMove to (4,3): new head (4,3), direction down (since moved down).\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)? Let's see: old body was (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — after move, new head (4,3), then body: (4,4) [old head], (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) — and (5,3) removed, so tail at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is now the tail position.\n\nAnd there is food at (6,3) with value 1.\n\nBut tail is at (6,3), so if I eat it, the tail grows, but since it's the tail cell, when I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is added at the food position.\n\nBut head is at (4,3), not adjacent to tail at (6,3), so no immediate danger.\n\nFood at (6,3) is under the tail now.\n\nSince tail is at (6,3), and I move away, the food will be exposed.\n\nOn turn 47, after moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction down, so cannot move U. Allowed: D, L, R.\n\nMove D to (4,2): within bounds, not body? Positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) — no (4,2), so safe.\n\nMove L to (3,3): not occupied, safe.\n\nMove R to (5,3): (5,3) is not in positions, so safe.\n\nNo food.\n\nBut tail at (6,3) with food, so if I can get head to (6,3) when it's free, I can eat it.\n\nSince tail is at (6,3), when the snake moves, the tail will move away if no growth, so (6,3) will be free.\n\nFor example, on turn 48, from (4,3), if I move, say, to (4,2), then new head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), etc, tail (6,4) or something, (6,3) is left.\n\nAfter move, new positions: head to new, body shift, tail removed, so (6,3) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut head is at (4,3), far from (6,3).\n\nI should move towards (6,3).\n\nBut let's go back to turn 46 choices.\n\nAnother option on turn 46: move left to (1,4).\n\nTurn 46: move L to (1,4)\n\nNew head at (1,4), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) removed? Tail was (4,4), removed.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), then (2,4) [old head], (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nFood: (1,6) life span 1 now, can be eaten on turn 47 if head moves to (1,6) on turn 47.\n\nFrom (1,4), on turn 47, I can move U to (1,5), then from (1,5) I can move to (1,6) on turn 48, but on turn 48 it's gone, as life span 0.\n\nTo eat on turn 47, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 47, but from (1,4), I can only move to (1,5), (1,3), or (2,4), not directly to (1,6). So I cannot eat (1,6) on turn 47, so it will disappear.\n\nThen from (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), R to (2,4) (since L to (0,4) wall).\n\nCurrent direction left, so cannot move R? Current direction after move is left, so instant reverse is right, so cannot move R.\n\nAfter moving left to (1,4), direction is left, so on next turn, cannot move right (opposite).\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L. But L to (0,4) wall, so only U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n\nNeither leads to food immediately.\n\nThen I am on the left side, far from the other food.\n\nNot good for reaching (6,2) or (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (2,3) on turn 46.\n\nNew head (2,3), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nThen from (2,3), moves: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), all safe, no food.\n\nThen I need to navigate to the right.\n\nBut the food at (6,3) is occupied, and tail is at (4,3), not at (6,3).\n\nTo free (6,3), I need the body to move away.\n\nSince the snake is long, moving will eventually vacate (6,3).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nThe quickest way to eat (6,3) is to have the tail at that position, so when tail moves, it exposes the food.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is segment, not tail.\n\nIn the current state, tail is at (4,4).\n\nIf I can make the tail be at (6,3), then when I move, it vacates, and I can eat.\n\nBut I need to move the snake such that the tail is at (6,3).\n\nBut the tail is fixed relative to the head; I can't directly control where the tail is, only by moving the head.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving towards the food at (6,2), which is free.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), life span 7, so I have time.\n\nFrom current position (2,4), the path to (6,2) is possible, but I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, move right to (3,4) on turn 46, as I thought earlier.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3) or right to (4,4), but from (3,4), moving right to (4,4) is possible, as I said.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can only move down to (4,3), as U and R are blocked by body.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (5,3) or (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nLet's list the positions after turn 46 move R to (3,4):\n\nTurn 46: head to (3,4), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 47: from (3,4), move R to (4,4) (since U and L not good or not allowed, L not allowed).\n\nMove to (4,4): new head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), only possible move D to (4,3), as U to (4,5) body, R to (5,4) body, L not allowed (current direction right, so left reverse not allowed).\n\nSo move D to (4,3).\n\nTurn 47: move to (4,3), new head (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nNow tail at (6,3) with food.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,3), direction down (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, (6,3) has food, and it is the tail position. When I move on turn 48, if I don't eat food, the tail will move away, vacating (6,3), and food will be there.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move head to (6,3) when it's free.\n\nCurrently head at (4,3), (6,3) is two steps away.\n\nIf on turn 48 I move to (5,3), then on turn 49 I can move to (6,3) to eat.\n\nBut when I move to (5,3) on turn 48, what happens to the tail.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,3), move R to (5,3).\n\nNew head (5,3), direction right (since moved right).\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)? Old body: (4,3) head? Before move, positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), new head (5,3), then body: (4,3) [old head], (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  // and (6,3) removed, so tail at (6,4).\n\n(6,3) is vacated, and food is there, so now (6,3) has food and is free.\n\nOn turn 49, head at (5,3), I can move down to (5,2), left to (4,3) body, right to (6,3), or up to (5,4) body.\n\n(5,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,2), or R to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has food, so I can move to (6,3) to eat it.\n\nMove R to (6,3): since (6,3) is free now, and has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, on turn 49, before moving, tail is at (6,4), head at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (5,3) and (6,4): delta x=1, delta y=1, so not adjacent, diagonal not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\n(5,3) and (6,4): |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent; adjacent cells share an edge, so only up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (5,3) adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3).\n\nTail at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (5,3), since (6,4) is diagonal.\n\nSo no problem, I can move to (6,3) and eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows, so length increases.\n\nSimilarly, I can also reach (6,2) later.\n\nBut (6,2) has life span 7, so after turn 46, 47, 48, etc., still time.\n\nIn this path, by moving right on turn 46, I can potentially eat the food at (6,3) on turn 49.\n\nTurn 46: move R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 47: move R to (4,4)\n\nBut from (3,4) to (4,4) is right, then from (4,4) to (4,3) down.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 49: from (5,3) move R to (6,3) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the direction constraints.\n\nOn turn 46, move R from (2,4) to (3,4), direction becomes right.\n\nTurn 47: from (3,4) move R to (4,4), direction right, allowed.\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3), direction down, not reverse of right, so allowed.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,3) direction down, move R to (5,3), which is right, not reverse, so allowed.\n\nTurn 49: from (5,3) direction right (since moved right to (5,3)? On turn 48, moved to (5,3) from (4,3) by moving right, so direction is right.\n\nThen on turn 49, move R to (6,3), which is right, not reverse, so allowed.\n\nAnd eat the food.\n\nNow, is there any risk? On turn 48, when at (5,3), moving to (6,3), which is free, no body, no wall.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (3,6) is not in the way.\n\nMoreover, after eating, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (6,2)? I can go there after.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving down or left on turn 46 is better.\n\nIf I move down to (2,3) on turn 46, then I need to go to (6,3), which is farther, and it might take more turns, and (6,3) life span 10, so ok, but (6,2) life 7, might be tight if I delay.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (1,4) is away from food.\n\nSo moving right seems best to reach the food quickly.\n\nBut on turn 47, when at (3,4), instead of moving to (4,4), I could move down to (3,3), but that might not be better.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3) on turn 47, then from (3,3), I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 46: at (3,4)\n\nMove D to (3,3) on turn 47.\n\nNew head (3,3), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail? Positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and (5,3) removed? Tail was (4,3) before, but after turn 46, tail at (4,3), so when move to (3,3), body: (3,4) [old head], (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — and (4,3) removed, so tail at (5,3).\n\n(6,3) still occupied.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (3,2), (2,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is free now? Not occupied, so I can move to (4,3), but then to reach (6,3) it takes longer.\n\nWhereas with the first path, I can eat on turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I can go after.\n\nNow, also, after eating (6,3), the snake grows, and I can target (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is below.\n\nLife span 7: after turn 46, life span 7, so decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 46: life 7\n\nAfter turn 46: life 6\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 52, can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 49, if I eat (6,3), then on turn 50, I can go to (6,2) if possible.\n\nFrom (6,3), after eating, head at (6,3), then I can move down to (6,2) to eat the other food.\n\n(6,2) has value 1, positive.\n\nAnd no immediate danger.\n\nBut need to check if adjacent to tail or something.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3) on turn 49, new positions: head at (6,3), body includes the previous head and all, with tail not moved, so positions: after move to (6,3), since food eaten, tail stays, so new snake: [ (6,3) head, (5,3) previous head, (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] and since eaten, tail was at (6,4), but it stays, so (6,4) is now part of body, and new tail is somewhere.\n\nBefore eating: on turn 48, after move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nThen on turn 49, move to (6,3): since (6,3) has food, it is eaten, so snake grows: head to (6,3), the body segments: the tail (6,4) does not move, so positions: head (6,3), then (5,3) [previous head], (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  // and since growth, (6,4) remains, so tail now at (6,4)? List: new head (6,3), then previous positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — so the body includes (6,4), and tail is (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is the last position.\n\nNow head at (6,3), tail at (6,4).\n\nNow, I can move down to (6,2) on turn 50.\n\n(6,2) is within bounds, no wall, not body? Positions: (6,3) head, (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — no (6,2), so safe.\n\nAnd food there, so eat (6,2) on turn 50.\n\nThen snake grows again.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut need to get there.\n\nIn this sequence, from turn 46 to 49, I eat (6,3) on turn 49.\n\nThen on turn 50, eat (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) life span: at turn 49, after decreases, life span was 7 on turn 46, after turn 46:6, turn 47:5, turn 48:4, turn 49:3, so on turn 50, when I eat, life span decreases to 2 after turn 49? Let's track.\n\nTurn 46: (6,2) life span 7\n\nAfter turn 46: decreases to 6\n\nTurn 47: life span 6, after turn decreases to 5\n\nTurn 48: life span 5, after turn decreases to 4\n\nTurn 49: life span 4, after turn decreases to 3\n\nTurn 50: life span 3, can be eaten during turn 50.\n\nYes, so on turn 50 I can eat it.\n\nNow, back to turn 46, if I move right, I can achieve this.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 47, when at (3,4), I need to move to (4,4), but earlier I thought from (4,4) I can only move down, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the detour?\n\nFor example, from (2,4) turn 46 move R to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 47, instead of to (4,4), can I move down to (3,3)? But from (3,3), to reach (6,3) it might take more turns.\n\nFor instance, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3), but on turn 47 at (3,3), turn 48 to (4,3), turn 49 to (5,3), turn 50 to (6,3), same as before but one turn later for (6,3), which might be ok, but (6,3) life 10, but I eat on turn 50, still within life.\n\nBut with the first path, I eat on turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I might eat later.\n\nBut in the first path, I eat both by turn 50.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), but not in the way.\n\nAlso, when I move to (4,4) on turn 47, is it safe? Yes, as we checked.\n\nNow, what if on turn 46 I move down to (2,3)? Then I need to go right.\n\nFor example, turn 46 move D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 47 from (2,3) can move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2), etc.\n\nSay move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 48 to (4,3), turn 49 to (5,3), turn 50 to (6,3), then eat on turn 50, same as above but for (6,3), later.\n\nAnd (6,2) might be eaten on turn 51.\n\nBut life span ok.\n\nBut moving right immediately is faster.\n\nSimilarly, moving left is slower.\n\nSo best to move right on turn 46.\n\nThen for the sequence: turn 46: move R to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 47: must move to (4,4) or (3,3), but moving to (4,4) allows me to go to (4,3) next, then to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) on turn 47, then from (3,3) I can move to (4,3), but (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 46: at (2,3) if moved down, but let's not.\n\nStick with move right.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format is for turns starting from t1, so I need to output for turn 46, 47, 48, etc., but I don't need to specify all, but since it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\", I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I have a plan, I can output up to eating the food.\n\nBut to be precise, let's define the actions.\n\nTurn 46: move R (right) to (3,4)\n\nTurn 47: move R to (4,4)  // from (3,4) to (4,4)\n\nBut from (3,4) to (4,4) is right, and direction is right, so allowed.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,4) move D to (4,3)  // down\n\nThen turn 49: from (4,3) move R to (5,3)  // but on turn 48, after moving to (4,3), direction is down.\n\nThen from (4,3), move R to (5,3), which is right, not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen turn 50: from (5,3) move R to (6,3) to eat, but after turn 49, at (5,3), direction right, move R to (6,3).\n\nBut earlier I said turn 49 move to (6,3), but in sequence, on turn 49 I move to (5,3), then turn 50 to (6,3).\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\n- Turn 46: move R\n\n- Turn 47: move R to (4,4)\n\n- Turn 48: move D to (4,3)\n\n- Turn 49: move R to (5,3)\n\n- Turn 50: move R to (6,3) eat\n\nThen turn 50: move to (6,2)? No, from (6,3) I can move down to (6,2) on turn 50 or later.\n\nOn turn 50, after eating (6,3), head at (6,3), I can move down to (6,2) to eat (6,2) on turn 50? But on turn 50, I am moving to (6,3) to eat, so after that, on turn 51 I can move to (6,2).\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 49: at (5,3), move to (6,3), eat (6,3) during turn 49.\n\nThen after eating, positions as above.\n\nTurn 50: from (6,3), I can move down to (6,2), since (6,2) has food, eat it during turn 50.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should output from turn 46 onwards.\n\nBut the format is to box the sequence.\n\nAlso, for thinking ahead, this seems good.\n\nBut is there a risk in this path?\n\nFor example, on turn 47, when moving to (4,4), is (4,4) safe? Yes.\n\nThen to (4,3), safe.\n\nThen to (5,3), (5,3) might be occupied? On turn 48, when at (4,3), positions include (5,3)? No, as per earlier.\n\nAfter turn 48 move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is tail, but when I move to (5,3), it becomes free.\n\nThen move to (6,3) eat.\n\nThen to (6,2) eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I start by moving down or left, I might not reach in time or miss opportunities.\n\nBut (1,6) is not reachable anyway.\n\nSo I think moving right on turn 46 is best.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 46, 47, 48, etc.\n\nSince the plan is clear, I can output up to turn 50 or so.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and output the actions.\n\nIn the format, it might be for the immediate turns.\n\nSince turn 46 is current, I must specify action for turn 46.\n\nThen for future, I can specify as per plan.\n\nSo let's write:\n\nTurn 46: R\n\nTurn 47: R  // to (4,4)\n\nTurn 48: D  // to (4,3)\n\nTurn 49: R  // to (5,3)\n\nTurn 50: R  // to (6,3) eat\n\nThen optionally, I can say turn 51: D to (6,2) eat, but not necessary.\n\nSince after turn 50, I have eaten, and I can decide then.\n\nBut to show the plan, I can include.\n\nBut the answer format might expect only for the turns where action is taken, but I think specifying a sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps for turn 46 only, but the format shows multiple.\n\nLook: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ...\"\n\nSo I should provide a few turns.\n\nSince I have a plan for 5 turns, I can do up to turn 50.\n\nt1=46, so turns 46 to 50.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 46: R\n\nTurn 47: R\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nThen after that, move down to (6,2) but not in this sequence.\n\nBut on turn 50, moving to (6,3) eats, then on turn 51 I can go down.\n\nBut for the output, up to turn 50 is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the moves.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 48, when moving D to (4,3), from (4,4), moving down, direction down.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (4,3) direction down, move R to (5,3), which is right, not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen turn 50, from (5,3) direction right, move R to (6,3), allowed.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf on turn 47, from (3,4), I move down to (3,3), then I need to go to (4,3), etc., slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is optimal.\n\nTherefore, for turn 46, action is R.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize reaching the food at (6,3) efficiently while avoiding collisions and considering the life spans of available food. The food at (1,6) cannot be eaten due to its short life span (2 turns at turn 46) and the snake's position, making it impossible to reach by turn 47. The food at (6,2) has a longer life span (7 turns) and can be targeted after eating the food at (6,3). The food at (6,3) is currently under the snake's body but will become accessible as the tail moves away. The plan involves moving right immediately to position the snake for eating (6,3) by turn 49 and (6,2) by turn 50, while avoiding walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 46)**: From head position (2,4) with direction down, possible moves are down (D), left (L), or right (R). Moving right (R) to (3,4) is chosen to start the path toward the food at (6,3) efficiently.\n- **Food at (6,3)**: Occupied by the snake's body but will be vacated when the tail moves. By moving right and down, the snake can reach (5,3) by turn 49, allowing it to eat (6,3) on turn 50.\n- **Food at (6,2)**: Can be eaten on turn 50 after eating (6,3), as its life span allows (7 turns from turn 46, so it remains until turn 52).\n- **Collision Risks**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (3,6)), and body segments. The tail reward danger is not an issue, as the tail (at (4,4)) has no food initially, and after movements, head and tail are not adjacent when eating.\n- **Direction Constraints**: No instant reverse is respected (e.g., from down, cannot move up; from right, cannot move left).\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence below ensures the snake eats both positive foods by turn 50, maximizing score with minimal risk. After turn 50, the snake can continue safely.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are planned for turns 46 to 50, covering 5 turns ahead as required. This sequence safely navigates to eat both foods:\n- **Turn 46**: Move right (R) to (3,4). This starts the path toward the food and avoids the unreachable (1,6).\n- **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (4,4). From (3,4), moving right is allowed (no reverse) and positions the snake closer to (4,3).\n- **Turn 48**: Move down (D) to (4,3). From (4,4), moving down is the only safe option (up and right are blocked by body; left is reverse and not allowed). This move brings the snake to a key position for accessing (5,3).\n- **Turn 49**: Move right (R) to (5,3). From (4,3) with direction down, moving right is allowed and not a reverse. (5,3) is safe and adjacent to (6,3), setting up the food eat.\n- **Turn 50**: Move right (R) to (6,3) to eat the food (value +1, length increases). Then, from (6,3), move down (D) to (6,2) to eat the second food (value +1, length increases) on the same turn if possible, but the action for turn 50 is the move to (6,3); eating (6,2) occurs on turn 51. Since the output format specifies actions per turn, turn 50 is R to (6,3), and turn 51 would be D to (6,2) for completeness, but the sequence up to turn 50 is provided as per the 5-turn plan.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: R\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: D\nTurn 49: R\nTurn 50: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 47. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). That's 11 segments, so the snake is 11 cells long.\n\nHead direction is right, so it's moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it disappears after this turn, meaning if not eaten now, it's gone.\n\n- (6,2) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (6,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n(6,3) is a food position, but (6,3) is also part of the snake's body? Snake positions: ... (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So (6,3) is the 9th segment, which is the body. Food at (6,3) is under the body.\n\nAccording to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (6,3), since the snake is currently on it, it can't be eaten immediately; the snake needs to move so that the body leaves (6,3), and then later the head can come back to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (1,6) and (6,2) are not occupied by snake, I think. Let me check snake positions: (1,6) not listed, (6,2) not listed, so they are free.\n\n(6,3) is occupied.\n\nFood at (6,3) has life span 9, so it will stay for 9 turns, but since it's under the body, it might be eaten later.\n\nNow, current head position: (3,4), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: since head is moving right, I can go U, D, R, but not L because L is left, which is opposite to current direction right. No instant reverse: so cannot move L.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\n- (1,6): value +1, life span 1, so must be eaten this turn (turn 47) or it disappears. But can I reach it? Head at (3,4), (1,6) is left and up. From (3,4) to (1,6): x from 3 to 1, decrease by 2, y from 4 to 6, increase by 2. So it's two moves away: e.g., left then up, or up then left, but I can't move left directly because current direction is right, but after moving, I can change.\n\nThis turn, turn 47, I need to decide action for turn 47.\n\nFrom (3,4), with direction R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), but (3,5) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ... so (3,5) is the fourth segment, yes, it's body. Moving to (3,5) would cause collision, since head touches body immediately. So cannot go U to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (3,3)? (3,3) is not in snake positions. Snake: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So (3,3) is free? Let's see y=3: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), so (3,3) is not listed, and no wall, so should be free.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (3,6), so (3,3) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,4)? (4,4) not in snake positions. Snake has (4,5), (4,3), but not (4,4), so free.\n\n(4,4) is between head (3,4) and next? Body after head is (2,4), which is left, then (2,5), etc. So (4,4) is not occupied.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So (3,3), (4,4), etc. are free.\n\nNow, possible actions for turn 47:\n\n- U: to (3,5) — but (3,5) is occupied by body, so collision, death. Invalid.\n\n- D: to (3,3) — not occupied, no wall, so possible.\n\n- R: to (4,4) — not occupied, no wall, possible.\n\n- L: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is the second segment, directly adjacent, and moving left would put head on (2,4), which is body, so collision. Also, L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, moving L would be reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move L.\n\nSo only possible moves: D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (1,6) must be eaten this turn or lost. But from current position (3,4), it's two moves away: e.g., first left to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, cannot move there. Or up to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, cannot. So I cannot reach (1,6) in one move, and since it's life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so I cannot eat it at all. It will be gone after turn 47.\n\nTherefore, (1,6) is not achievable; I should ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (6,2) with value 1, life span 6, so it will stay until turn 47 + 6 = turn 53? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (1,6), life span 1, it will disappear after turn 47, meaning it can be eaten on turn 47 but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 6: it will disappear after turn 47 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, life span 1: countdown from 1, decreases to 0 after current turn, so only available on turn t, disappears at t+1.\n\nLife span 2: available on turn t and t+1, disappears at t+2.\n\nGenerally, food with life span L at turn t will be available for L turns: from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n\nSo here, turn 47:\n\n- Food (1,6): L=1, available only on turn 47\n\n- Food (6,2): L=6, available from turn 47 to 52, disappears at turn 53\n\n- Food (6,3): L=9, available from turn 47 to 55, disappears at turn 56\n\nBut (6,3) is under snake body, so it can only be eaten if snake moves away and head comes back.\n\nNow, back to current move: from (3,4), I can go D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nI need to think ahead to eat food and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid and snake movement.\n\nSnake positions: let's list for clarity:\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nBody: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter moving, the tail will move forward if no food eaten.\n\nIf I eat food, length increases, so tail stays, but since no food eaten this turn, after move, tail moves.\n\nCurrent move: if I move to a cell without food, snake moves head to new position, and tail moves away from current tail position.\n\nIf I move to a food, head grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut here, no food at (3,3) or (4,4), I think. Food at (1,6), (6,2), (6,3). (6,3) is occupied, so not accessible now.\n\n(3,3) and (4,4) have no food, so if I move there, no growth, tail moves.\n\nNow, let's simulate both options.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,3) on turn 47.\n\nNew head position: (3,3)\n\nNew direction: since I moved down, direction becomes D.\n\nSnake body: the head moves to (3,3), so new positions: head (3,3), then the previous head (3,4) becomes first body, and so on, up to (5,3) which was tail, but since no growth, the tail (4,3) is removed? Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,3): new head at (3,3), then the body segments: previous head (3,4) now first body, then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). The tail (4,3) is removed since no growth.\n\nNew tail is (5,3)? Positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and (5,3) is now the last body? Original last was (4,3), which is gone.\n\nList: new snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nSo tail is at (5,3).\n\nDirection is now down.\n\nFood: (1,6) disappears after this turn, so gone. (6,2) still there, (6,3) still there but under body at (6,3), which is part of snake.\n\n(6,3) is occupied by the snake, but food is there, so it can be eaten later if snake moves away.\n\nNow, from here, turn 48.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot go U (up), since current direction down.\n\nSo can go D, L, R.\n\n- D to (3,2): y=2, not border? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=2 is fine. (3,2) not occupied? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), etc., no (3,2), so free.\n\n- L to (2,3): not occupied? Snake: (2,4), (2,5), no (2,3), so free.\n\n- R to (4,3): (4,3) is not in new snake? New snake: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So (4,3) is not there, free.\n\n(4,3) was the old tail, removed.\n\nSo all three moves possible: D, L, R.\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is occupied, so cannot eat now.\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nAlso, after moving, the cell (6,3) might be vacated if the snake moves.\n\nIn current position, (6,3) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nIf the snake moves, that cell might be left.\n\nBut for eating, the head needs to move onto it after it's vacated.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option first.\n\nOption 2: Move R to (4,4) on turn 47.\n\nNew head position: (4,4)\n\nDirection now right? Moved R, so direction R.\n\nNew snake: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). Tail (4,3) removed.\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 48, head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (since L is left, opposite to R, not allowed).\n\n- U to (4,5): (4,5) is body segment? Snake: (4,5) is fifth segment, yes, occupied. Collision.\n\n- D to (4,3): (4,3) is not in snake? New snake: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (4,3) not there, free.\n\n- R to (5,4): (5,4) is body? Snake has (5,4) as seventh segment, occupied. Collision.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (4,3).\n\nMust move down to (4,3).\n\nThen new head (4,3), direction D.\n\nNew snake: head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). Tail (5,3) removed? Positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] so tail (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has food, but it's under tail now? Head is at (4,3), (6,3) is tail.\n\nBut food can be eaten only when head moves to it after it's free.\n\nNow, compare the two options.\n\nIn option 1 (move D to (3,3) at t47), at t48 I have choices: D, L, R from (3,3).\n\nIn option 2 (move R to (4,4) at t47), at t48 I must move D to (4,3), no choice.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,2) and (6,3).\n\n(6,2) is available until turn 52, and (6,3) until turn 55.\n\nAlso, there is a wall at (3,6), but (3,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, the snake is quite long, 11 cells, and the grid is small, 8x8 with walls, so space is limited. I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle (3,6).\n\nSo free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (3,6) is wall.\n\n(3,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions at t47:\n\nHead (3,4)\n\nBody: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo occupied: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) but (1,6) has food disappearing, (1,3), (1,2), etc., but we have to consider boundaries.\n\nAlso (3,3), (4,4), (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is occupied.\n\nNow, back to decision at t47.\n\nIf I move D to (3,3), new head (3,3), then at t48, I can move to (3,2), (2,3), or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is free now, but in new snake after move, (4,3) is not occupied, as we saw.\n\nIn option 1 after move D at t47, snake at (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo free around (3,3): (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right.\n\n(4,3) is free, yes.\n\nNow, food at (6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (6,2) in a few moves.\n\nFor example, go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then right to (5,2), then right to (6,2), but (5,2) and (6,2) need to be free.\n\n(5,2): is it occupied? Snake has (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), not (5,2), so free.\n\n(6,2) free.\n\nBut there might be shorter paths or other ways.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is occupied, but if I move the snake, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,2) at t48, then I can go to (6,2) directly or via other paths.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, if tail has food and head is next to tail, eating that food would cause collision after growth.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,3) in option 1 after t47 move.\n\nFood at (6,3), which is a body segment, not tail.\n\nBut if later, when the tail moves, if food is there, it could be an issue.\n\nFor now, not immediate.\n\nBut let's consider which move is better for long-term.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is coiled, and moving to (3,3) or (4,4) might open up space.\n\nIn option 2, if I move R to (4,4) at t47, then at t48 I must move D to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nFrom there, at t49, head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: since direction D, cannot go U, so can go D, L, R.\n\n- D to (4,2): free? (4,2) not occupied, no wall.\n\n- L to (3,3): free? In current snake: after t48 move, snake is [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] so (3,3) not there, free.\n\n- R to (5,3): (5,3) is in snake? Snake has (5,3) as last? Positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), ..., up to (6,3). (5,3) is not listed separately; in the list, (5,3) is the last segment? Let's see: after t48, snake: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] so the segments are (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). So (5,3) is not there; it was removed earlier. (5,3) is free.\n\n(5,3) is free now.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can go D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nR to (5,3) is possible.\n\nThen I can go to (6,2) from there.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has food and is currently occupied by the snake tail in some positions.\n\nIn option 1 after t47 move D to (3,3), the tail is at (5,3), and (6,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I can move the snake so that (6,3) is vacated, then head can eat the food there.\n\nFor example, if I move from (3,3) to (4,3) at t48, then head at (4,3), and the snake body moves, so (6,3) might be vacated if the tail moves.\n\nIn option 1, after t47 move to (3,3), snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] so (6,3) is occupied, and tail at (5,3).\n\nAt t48, if I move to (4,3), for example.\n\nMove R to (4,3).\n\nNew head (4,3), direction R.\n\nNew snake: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). Tail (5,3) removed.\n\nSo now (6,3) is still occupied, but it's not tail; it's the second last segment.\n\nThe cell (6,3) is occupied, and food is there, but not accessible.\n\nAfter this move, the tail is at (6,3)? Positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,3) is the last, so tail at (6,3).\n\nAnd (6,3) has food, but it's under the tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need the tail to move away so the cell is free, then head moves to it.\n\nBut if tail moves away, the food might still be there, and I can eat it.\n\nLife span is 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2).\n\nNow, let's consider the path to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2, value +1.\n\nFrom current head (3,4), if I go to (3,3) or (4,4), both are closer in a way.\n\nDistance to (6,2): from (3,4) to (6,2) is delta x=3, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 5.\n\nFrom (3,3) it's delta x=3, delta y=1, distance 4.\n\nFrom (4,4) it's delta x=2, delta y=2, distance 4.\n\nBut with body, I need to find a safe path.\n\nIn option 2, if I go to (4,4) at t47, then to (4,3) at t48, then at t49 I can go to (5,3), then to (6,3) or (6,2), but (6,3) has food and is occupied.\n\nAt t49, from (4,3) direction D, I can go to (5,3) for example.\n\nGo R to (5,3) at t49.\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nNew snake: from previous, after t48: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), etc. up to (6,3)\n\nAfter move R to (5,3): head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4). Tail (6,3) removed? Positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] so tail at (6,4).\n\n(6,3) is now free, and food is there, so I can move to (6,3) to eat it.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go to (6,3) or to (5,2), etc.\n\nIf I go to (6,3) at t50, I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if (6,3) is free.\n\nAt t49, after moving to (5,3), (6,3) is free because the tail moved from (6,3) to, in the new snake, (6,3) is not occupied; it was removed when tail moved.\n\nIn the move to (5,3), the cell (6,3) is vacated.\n\nThen at t50, from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n\n(6,3) has value +1, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (6,2) instead.\n\nBut eating (6,3) is good.\n\nIn this path, by moving R at t47, then D at t48, then R to (5,3) at t49, then to (6,3) at t50 to eat.\n\nAt t49, from (4,3) direction D, I can also go to (4,2) or (3,3), but going to (5,3) is direct to the food area.\n\nNow, in option 1, if I move D to (3,3) at t47, then at t48 I can go to (4,3), for example.\n\nThen from (4,3), similar to above.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 47: action\n\nThen turn 48, 49, etc.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to think ahead and choose the best first move.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I think I need to provide a sequence for a few turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nThe instruction: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"prioritize long-term survival\".\n\nBut I don't need to output all future turns, just the actions for the current and perhaps a few, but it's open.\n\nTo demonstrate thinking ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut let's first decide on t47.\n\nIn option 2, by moving R at t47, I can reach the food at (6,3) by t50, as above.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I can go later.\n\nIn option 1, moving D to (3,3), then I need to go to (4,3) or other, which might take more turns to reach (6,3).\n\nFor example, from (3,3) at t47, if I go to (4,3) at t48, then same as above, I can go to (5,3) at t49, then (6,3) at t50.\n\nSame as option 2 path.\n\nIn option 2, at t47 move R to (4,4), then t48 move D to (4,3), t49 move R to (5,3), t50 move to (6,3) or (6,2).\n\nIn option 1, t47 move D to (3,3), t48 move R to (4,3), t49 move R to (5,3), t50 move to (6,3).\n\nSame from t48 onwards.\n\nBut at t47, if I move D to (3,3), at t48 I have other choices, but I can choose to go R to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, in both cases, I can reach (5,3) by t49.\n\nNow, the difference is at t47 position.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) at t47, I had to move down at t48, no choice.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) at t47, at t48 I can choose to go left, down, or right.\n\nBut going left or down might not be towards food.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,2) at t48, then I am farther from (6,2) or (6,3).\n\n(6,2) is at y=2, so (3,2) is closer in y but same x.\n\nFrom (3,2) I can go to (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) to eat (6,2).\n\nBut (6,3) is also there.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\n(6,2) life span 6, available until turn 52 (t47 to t52, disappear t53).\n\nt47: available, t48,49,50,51,52.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) available until t55.\n\nt47 to t55, disappear t56.\n\nNow current turn 47.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) at t47, and then to (3,2) at t48, then to (4,2) at t49, to (5,2) at t50, to (6,2) at t51 to eat (6,2).\n\nt51 is within life span, since t52 available.\n\nIf I go directly, from (3,4) to (6,2) in fewer moves, but with body, it might not be direct.\n\nBut in the path above, it takes 4 moves: t47 to (3,3), t48 to (3,2)? From (3,3) to (3,2) is down, then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2).\n\nt47: move D to (3,3) — not eating, just moving.\n\nt48: move D to (3,2)\n\nt49: move R to (4,2)\n\nt50: move R to (5,2)\n\nt51: move R to (6,2) and eat.\n\nAt t51, which is turn 51, and (6,2) available until t52, so yes.\n\nBut I can eat (6,3) earlier if I go that way.\n\nIn the other path, I can eat (6,3) at t50.\n\nt50 is earlier.\n\nMoreover, eating (6,3) gives +1 and length increases, which might be good for survival.\n\nBut there is a risk with tail reward, but not immediate.\n\nNow, back to the choice at t47.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) at t47, then I must move D to (4,3) at t48, then at t49 I can move to (5,3), then to (6,3) at t50 to eat.\n\nIf I move D to (3,3) at t47, at t48 I can move to (4,3) directly, then same as above: to (5,3) at t49, to (6,3) at t50.\n\nSo both can achieve eating (6,3) at t50.\n\nBut in the first case, when I move R to (4,4) at t47, I move to a cell that might be closer to the center, but (4,4) is free, no issue.\n\nHowever, in that move, when I go to (4,4), the snake was at (3,4) and (4,4) was free, but after moving, the body is still there.\n\nBut in terms of space, moving to (3,3) might open up more space on the left or down.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,3), I can access the bottom-left area.\n\nBut with the wall at (3,6), the top is blocked.\n\ny=6 has (3,6) wall, so row y=6 is partially blocked.\n\nBut (1,6) food is gone.\n\nNow, another point: the tail is at (4,3) initially, and after moves, it moves.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor instance, if I go to (3,3) at t47, then at t48 I could go to (2,3), then I am near (2,4) and (2,5), which might be risky if I turn incorrectly.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I go up to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, collision.\n\nOr go left to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut it might lead to trapping.\n\nWhereas moving towards the right, to (6,2) or (6,3), there is space.\n\nAlso, (6,2) is at corner, but since walls, it might be risky, but I can go there and eat.\n\nNow, since both paths can lead to eating (6,3) at t50, but in the move to (4,4) at t47, I had no choice at t48, must go down, whereas in move to (3,3), I have flexibility at t48.\n\nBut for reaching food, it's similar.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (6,2) as well.\n\n(6,2) and (6,3) are adjacent.\n\nAfter eating (6,3) at t50, I can go to (6,2) at t51 to eat it, if I want.\n\nBut (6,2) life span until t52, so possible.\n\nNow, is there a reason to prefer one over the other?\n\nIn the initial state, when I move to (4,4) at t47, I moved right, which is consistent with direction, but I have to move down next.\n\nIn moving to (3,3), I moved down, changing direction.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nPerhaps moving to (3,3) allows me to avoid a potential trap.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), after eating at (6,3), head at (6,3), and I grow, so tail doesn't move.\n\nThen snake longer, and I need to move from (6,3).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is body? After eating, the body is: before move to (6,3), let's say at t49 head at (5,3), snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nThen move to (6,3) at t50, eat food, so new head at (6,3), and the tail does not move, so body includes previous head (5,3) and all, with tail at (6,4) still? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nAfter move to (6,3) and eat, new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), ..., up to (6,4), and tail remains (6,4), but since grow, the tail stays, so positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (6,4). So now 12 segments.\n\nThen from (6,3), direction, say if I moved right to (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is tail, and if I move there, head to tail, but tail will move? When I move, if I go to (6,4), it is occupied by tail, but since the tail will move after, if no food, it might be ok.\n\nCollision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is allowed, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (6,4) is tail, so I can move U to (6,4), and then tail moves to the next, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,2), which is food, or L to (5,3), but (5,3) is body segment, not tail, so if I move to (5,3), it is body, collision.\n\nFrom (6,3), with direction R (since I moved right to it).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4): (6,4) is tail, so allowed, tail will move.\n\nD to (6,2): free, and has food.\n\nR: x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is body, second segment, so collision, invalid.\n\nSo I can go U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nIf I go D to (6,2), I eat the food there, grow again.\n\nThen snake longer.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then tail moves, etc.\n\nBut (6,2) is available, so better to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I came from the other path.\n\nBut back to t47 choice.\n\nIn both cases, I can reach and eat the foods.\n\nBut let's consider the risk.\n\nIn the state after moving to (4,4) at t47, the head is at (4,4), and I must move down to (4,3), which is fine.\n\nBut at (4,4), if I could have choices, but I don't, only down.\n\nWhereas at (3,3), I have choices.\n\nBut for survival, moving to (3,3) might be better because it opens up the bottom area.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go to (3,2), (2,3), etc., which might be safer if the right side is crowded.\n\nBut the right side has food, so I need to go there.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,3) is under body, and in the path where I move to (5,3) first, I can free it and eat.\n\nIf I don't go that way, it might be eaten later or not.\n\nBut I think going for (6,3) is good.\n\nNow, to decide: let's see if one move has a problem.\n\nFor instance, if I move R to (4,4) at t47, (4,4) was free, no issue.\n\nThen move D to (4,3) at t48, (4,3) free.\n\nThen at t49, from (4,3), I can move to (5,3), which is free, as we said.\n\n(5,3) is free at that time.\n\nThen to (6,3) at t50.\n\nIf I move D to (3,3) at t47, then to (4,3) at t48, same as above.\n\nThe only difference is at t47 position.\n\nMoving to (3,3) might be slightly better because it vacates (3,4) or something, but not significant.\n\nIn terms of the food (1,6), it's gone, so no issue.\n\nI think both are viable, but let's choose one.\n\nPerhaps moving down to (3,3) is safer because it avoids the area near (4,5) and (5,5), but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (3,6), but y=6 is high, and snake is at y=4,5, so not immediate.\n\nI think I should go for the food directly.\n\nSince the snake is long, eating food increases length, but also might make it harder to maneuver, but in this case, I need to eat to score, but survival first.\n\nBut avoiding risks.\n\nThe bottom-left area has more space? Let's see free cells.\n\nFor example, cells like (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nWhereas right side, (6,2), (6,3), but (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut with the body, it's a bit crowded on the right, but I can move.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps moving down to (3,3) at t47 is better for long-term survival because it heads towards the open area.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2) or (2,3), then to the left, and later come back for food if possible.\n\nBut the food at (6,2) and (6,3) will disappear if not eaten soon.\n\n(6,2) by t52, (6,3) by t55, so I have time.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) at t48, then to (1,3) at t49, etc., but that might be away from food.\n\nThen I need to come back, which might take more turns.\n\nWhereas if I go towards food now, I can eat it in 3 turns.\n\nTurn t47 to t50 is 3 moves to eat.\n\nt47 move, t48 move, t49 move, t50 eat, so 3 moves after t47 action.\n\nt47 action is move, then t48 move, t49 move, t50 move and eat.\n\n4 actions to eat.\n\nt47: move to position\n\nt48: move\n\nt49: move\n\nt50: move to food and eat.\n\nSo after 3 moves from now.\n\nBut I can eat at t50.\n\nIf I go away, it might take longer.\n\nSo for scoring, better to eat soon.\n\nAlso, survival: if I go to the left, there might be dead ends, but with walls, the grid is small.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), I can go to (1,2), (1,4), but (1,4) is body? Not necessarily.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nWhereas the food area is accessible.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I can explore other areas.\n\nI think moving towards the food is better.\n\nNow, between moving to (3,3) or (4,4) at t47, both can lead to food, but moving to (4,4) forces me to move down next, while moving to (3,3) gives flexibility.\n\nBut in practice, for this path, I will use the flexibility to go to (4,3) next.\n\nSo let's plan a sequence.\n\nI think I'll go with moving down to (3,3) at t47 for more options.\n\nThen at t48, move right to (4,3)\n\nThen at t49, move right to (5,3)\n\nThen at t50, move to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n\nAt t50, move to (6,3), which is eating.\n\nThen from there, as before, I can go to (6,2) to eat that food at t51.\n\nThen I have eaten both, score +2.\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive.\n\nBut let's confirm if this is possible.\n\nFirst, turn 47: move D to (3,3)\n\nSnake: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] tail at (5,3)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 48: move R to (4,3)\n\nNew head (4,3), direction R\n\nNew snake: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,3) has food, but not eaten yet, since head not on it.\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free? Not occupied in current snake.\n\nNew head (5,3), direction R\n\nNew snake: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail at (6,4)? Positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] so tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,3) is now free, and food is there.\n\nTurn 50: move to (6,3) to eat food.\n\nSince (6,3) is adjacent and free, move R to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), direction R\n\nSince eat food, snake grows: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) and tail remains (6,4), so positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] 12 segments.\n\nDirection right.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (6,4): (6,4) is tail, so allowed, tail will move.\n\nD to (6,2): free and has food.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is body, second segment, collision, invalid.\n\nR: x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo can go U or D.\n\n(6,2) has food, so go D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 51: move D to (6,2)\n\nEat food, grow.\n\nNew head (6,2), direction D (since moved down)\n\nNew snake: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nNow, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3): (6,3) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nD to (6,1): y=1, not wall? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is free, but need to check if occupied. Not in snake, so free.\n\nL to (5,2): free? Not occupied.\n\nR: x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo can go D or L.\n\nDirection down, so cannot go U? Current direction D, so cannot go U (up), instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can go D, L, R but R invalid, so D or L.\n\n- D to (6,1)\n\n- L to (5,2)\n\nBoth free.\n\nI can go to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I have eaten both foods, score increased.\n\nNow, back to turn 47, I moved D to (3,3).\n\nBut if I moved R to (4,4) at t47, I can have a similar sequence but with one step different.\n\nFor example, t47: R to (4,4)\n\nt48: D to (4,3) (only choice)\n\nt49: R to (5,3)\n\nt50: R to (6,3) eat\n\nt51: D to (6,2) eat\n\nSame as above, but at t47 I moved to (4,4) instead of (3,3).\n\nIn terms of position, after t47, in first case head at (3,3), in second at (4,4).\n\nBut both lead to eating at t50 and t51.\n\nNow, in the first sequence, at t48 I moved to (4,3) from (3,3), which is right.\n\nIn the second, from (4,4) to (4,3), down.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nI think moving down to (3,3) at t47 is fine.\n\nTo be consistent, let's output a sequence.\n\nSince the problem asks to think ahead, I'll provide actions for a few turns.\n\nSo for turn 47: move D (down)\n\nThen turn 48: move R (right) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 49: move R (right) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 50: move R (right) to (6,3) and eat\n\nTurn 51: move D (down) to (6,2) and eat\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,2) or (6,1), but I don't need to specify further, but for the answer, I can list up to turn 51 or so.\n\nThe answer format should start from t1, which is 47.\n\nAnd I need to maximize score, so eating both is good.\n\nIs there a way to eat (1,6)? No, impossible.\n\nSo this sequence scores +2.\n\nIf I don't eat, no score, worse.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that allows the snake to eat the positive food at (6,3) and (6,2) within their life spans, while avoiding collisions and considering the grid constraints. The food at (1,6) has a life span of 1 and cannot be reached safely by turn 47, so it is ignored.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 47)**:\n  - Snake head at (3,4), direction right.\n  - Possible moves: Down (to (3,3)) or Right (to (4,4)); Up and Left are invalid due to body collision and no instant reverse.\n  - Moving Down to (3,3) is chosen as it provides more flexibility for future moves and avoids immediate risks.\n- **Food Targets**:\n  - (6,3): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 55). Currently under the snake's body at (6,3), so it can only be eaten after the snake moves away and the head returns.\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 52). Accessible and should be eaten after (6,3).\n- **Path to Food**:\n  - From (3,4), move Down to (3,3) on turn 47.\n  - Then move Right to (4,3) on turn 48, Right to (5,3) on turn 49, and Right to (6,3) on turn 50 to eat the food (life span allows this).\n  - After eating (6,3), move Down to (6,2) on turn 51 to eat that food (life span allows this).\n- **Survival and Risks**:\n  - This path avoids body collisions and walls.\n  - After eating both foods, the snake grows to length 13, and future moves can focus on open areas (e.g., moving to (5,2) or (6,1)) to avoid dead ends.\n  - The sequence is planned for 5 turns (turns 47–51) to ensure the food is eaten safely within life spans.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 47**: Move Down (D) to (3,3). This avoids the body at (3,5) and positions the snake toward open space.\n- **Turn 48**: Move Right (R) to (4,3). This moves toward the food area and vacates (6,3) for future eating.\n- **Turn 49**: Move Right (R) to (5,3). This sets up for eating (6,3) and keeps the path clear.\n- **Turn 50**: Move Right (R) to (6,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 12).\n- **Turn 51**: Move Down (D) to (6,2) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 13).\n\nThis sequence scores +2 by turn 51 and ensures the snake survives by avoiding collisions and utilizing the available life spans. Beyond turn 51, the snake should navigate to open cells (e.g., (5,2) or (6,1)) to continue surviving.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 47: D (down)\nTurn 48: R (right)\nTurn 49: R (right)\nTurn 50: R (right)\nTurn 51: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 48, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, I can't move into walls or obstacles.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). The head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (3,4) to (3,3), I think? Positions are listed head first, so head is (3,3), then (3,4) is the next segment. Since head direction is D, and it's at (3,3), which is below (3,4), that makes sense; it moved down to (3,3).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\n(6,3) is listed, but (6,3) is also part of the snake body; it's the second last segment. Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So (6,3) is occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nHere, (6,3) has food with life span 8 and value 1. But since the snake is on it, I can only eat it if the snake moves off and then head moves back when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has food with life span 6, value 1.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 48, for (6,2) life span 6, it will disappear after 6 turns, so at turn 54? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one? Let me clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nFor example, if at turn t, life span is 1, it should disappear after this turn, so it can be eaten only on turn t. If life span is 1, countdown decreases to 0 and disappears after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, if life span is N at turn t, it will be available until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n\nIn the input, life span is given, and it decreases each turn.\n\nFor (6,2): life span 6 at turn 48, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning it lasts for turns 48 to 53, and disappears at turn 54? Turn 48: life span 6, after turn 48, life span becomes 5, so it decreases after the turn. Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nIt says \"including current\", so at the start of turn t, life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1. If L=1, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (6,2): at turn 48, life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 48 to turn 53 (since after turn 53, life span would be 0? Let's define:\n\n- Start of turn t: food has life span L\n\n- During turn t, it can be eaten\n\n- After turn t, life span decreases to L-1\n\n- If after decrease, L-1 = 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for L=6 at turn 48:\n\n- Turn 48: life span 6, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 48, life span 5\n\n- Turn 49: life span 5, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 53: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 53, life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 54.\n\nSimilarly for (6,3): life span 8 at turn 48, so available from turn 48 to turn 55, disappears at turn 56.\n\nNow, (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake body, so I can't eat it now. I need the snake to move off that cell so that later, head can move to it when it's free.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nFirst, I need to know where the tail is. Snake positions: list is head to tail, so tail is last segment: (5,3).\n\nHead is at (3,3), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (3,3) and (5,3) are two units apart in x, same y, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\nPossible adjacent cells to head: (3,3) can go to (3,2) down? Head direction is D, down, so moving down decreases y? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might be north, so y=0 could be south. But in walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y increases upwards or downwards? U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake head at (3,3), direction D (down), so it just moved to (3,3) from (3,4), since positions: (3,3) head, then (3,4) next, so it moved down from (3,4) to (3,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3): since head direction is D, I can move L (left to (2,3)?), R (right to (4,3)?), or D (down to (3,2)?), but not U, because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction D, so I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite.\n\nAllowed moves: not opposite to current direction. So from D, I can go L, R, or D, not U.\n\nNow, adjacent cells to head (3,3):\n\n- Up (U): (3,4) but that's occupied by the body, specifically the second segment.\n\n- Down (D): (3,2) - what is this? Is it wall or free?\n\n- Left (L): (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): (4,3)\n\nFirst, check walls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7. So (3,2): y=2, which is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not here. So (3,2) should be free, but is it occupied by body?\n\nSnake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So cells occupied: all these. (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): not in list, should be free.\n\n(4,3): not in list, free.\n\n(3,4) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nNow, (6,3) has food but is occupied, so cannot eat now.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,3), both positive.\n\n(6,3) is occupied, (6,2) is free but has food.\n\n(6,2) is a cell, not occupied by snake, and has food with life span 6.\n\nI need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (3,3), direction D.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- D: down to (3,2)\n\n- L: left to (2,3)\n\n- R: right to (4,3)\n\nCannot go U to (3,4) because occupied.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, tail is at (5,3), and head is at (3,3), not adjacent, so no immediate tail danger.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) might be tempting, but I have to navigate to it.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So 11 segments.\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nFood: (6,2) with life 6, value 1; (6,3) with life 8, value 1, but occupied.\n\n(6,3) is occupied, so I need to free it first.\n\nLife span of (6,2) is 6, so it will disappear after turn 53, as we said.\n\n(6,3) life span 8, disappear after turn 55.\n\nNow, since (6,3) is occupied, and it's part of the body, when the snake moves, the tail will move, so if I move in a way that the tail leaves (6,3), then (6,3) becomes free, and if head moves there later, I can eat the food.\n\nBut the food is on (6,3), so when the tail moves off, the food is still there unless it times out.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nNow, to eat (6,2), I need to move head to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is below (6,3), which is currently occupied.\n\nCurrent head at (3,3).\n\nI need to get to (6,2).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, from (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), L to (2,3), or R to (4,3).\n\nIf I go D to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) might be safe, but let's see the body.\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves, so segments shift.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n\nBut for movement, when I take an action, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail segment is removed, so the body follows.\n\nSo, after move, the new positions depend on whether I eat food or not.\n\nFirst, let's plan the sequence.\n\nI should consider the state after each move.\n\nTurn 48: current state, I need to choose action for turn 48.\n\nThen turn 49, etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but I don't know how many; the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to plan a sequence, perhaps until I eat food or something, but since it's about thinking ahead, I should plan 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so for the answer, I should output actions for turns 48 to 52 or 53, say 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nAlso, maximize score, so I should try to eat the food if possible.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach (6,2) within the life span.\n\n(6,2) life span 6, from turn 48, available until turn 53.\n\nDistance from (3,3) to (6,2): |dx| = 3, |dy| =1, so Manhattan distance 4, so I can reach it in 4 moves if no obstacles.\n\nFor example, right to (4,3), then (5,3), but (5,3) is tail, which might be ok, but let's see.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so when I move to it, since tail will move, it should be safe, as long as I don't collide with other body parts.\n\nGeneral rule: moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so the head occupies the cell that was tail, but since tail moves, no collision, except if I eat food there, it might cause issue with tail reward danger, but only if head is adjacent and tail has food, but here it's different.\n\nThe tail reward danger is specific: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, and I eat it, then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail which is at the same position.\n\nBut if I move directly to the tail cell, it's not adjacent; I'm moving to it, so if tail has food, and I move to it, I eat the food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the food cell, which was tail, so now the new tail is there, but since head moved to it, after eating, the head is there and tail is there? Let's think.\n\nWhen I eat food, the snake grows, so the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; it stays, so the new tail is the old tail, but since head moved to a cell that might have been tail, it could cause collision.\n\nStandard snake rules: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nIf you move to a cell that was the tail, and you eat food there, then after moving, head is on that cell, and tail is still there? No.\n\nPositions: suppose tail is at P, and head moves to P to eat food. After eating, the head is at P, and since you ate food, the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, so now head and tail are both at P, which is collision.\n\nYes, that's the tail reward danger mentioned: if head moves to tail cell and eats food, it dies because collision.\n\nIn this case, if the cell has food and is tail, moving there to eat causes death.\n\nOtherwise, if no food, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, if cell has food but not tail, eating is fine.\n\nIn this state, (6,3) has food and is a body segment, but not tail; tail is (5,3).\n\n(6,3) is the second last segment.\n\nIf I move to (6,3), it has food, so I would eat it, but since it's not tail, no problem, but it's occupied now, so I can't move there yet.\n\nBack to reaching (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is free, has food.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is not occupied, as per positions.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go R to (5,3), which is tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail, and does it have food? The food is at (6,3) and (6,2), not at (5,3). So (5,3) has no food, so moving to it should be safe, since tail will move away.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go D to (5,2), or R to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied now, or U to (5,4), etc.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, action.\n\nI need to choose: D, L, or R.\n\nIf I go R to (4,3), that seems towards (6,2).\n\nIf I go D to (3,2), that might lead me down.\n\nIf I go L to (2,3), left.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (6,3). It has longer life span, 8 turns, so I have time.\n\n(6,2) has shorter life, only 6 turns, so I should prioritize eating it if possible, but only if safe.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nNow, let's list the snake positions to see the body layout.\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nSegment 2: (3,4)\n\nSegment 3: (2,4)\n\nSegment 4: (2,5)\n\nSegment 5: (3,5)\n\nSegment 6: (4,5)\n\nSegment 7: (5,5)\n\nSegment 8: (5,4)\n\nSegment 9: (6,4)\n\nSegment 10: (6,3)\n\nSegment 11 (tail): (5,3)\n\nThe snake is coiled; let's plot:\n\ny=5: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\ny=4: (3,4), (2,4)? (2,4) is at y=4, x=2; (3,4) at x=3,y=4; (5,4) at x=5,y=4; (6,4) at x=6,y=4\n\ny=3: head (3,3), and (6,3), and tail (5,3)\n\nAlso (5,3) and (6,3) are at y=3.\n\nThe body forms a sort of loop or something.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4) up, then to (2,4) left, then to (2,5) up, then to (3,5) right, to (4,5) right, to (5,5) right, to (5,4) down, to (6,4) right, to (6,3) down, to (5,3) left.\n\nSo the tail is at (5,3), which is left of (6,3).\n\nNow, to reach (6,2), which is below (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied, so I need to free it or go around.\n\n(6,2) is free, so I can go directly if I can reach it.\n\nFrom head (3,3), one way is to go R to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3) or (5,2) or (6,2) directly from (5,3).\n\n(5,3) to (6,2) is not adjacent; (6,2) is down-left or something? (5,3) to (6,2) is right and down, not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,2) down, (5,4) up, (4,3) left, (6,3) right.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) right, or (5,2) down, or (5,4) up, or (4,3) left.\n\n(6,2) is not directly accessible from (5,3); I need to go to (6,3) first or to (5,2) then to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied now.\n\nSince (6,3) has food, and it's occupied, I can plan to eat it later when free.\n\nSimilarly for (6,2).\n\nLet's consider moving towards (6,2).\n\nOption 1: go R to (4,3) on turn 48.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction R (since I moved right).\n\nThen from there, I can go R to (5,3), which is tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail, no food, so moving to it is safe; after move, tail moves away.\n\nSo turn 49: move R to (5,3).\n\nThen head at (5,3), but (5,3) was tail, so when I move to it, since no food, the tail moves, so the new tail is the previous segment, which was (6,3) I think.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3) on turn 49:\n\n- Head moves to (5,3)\n\n- Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new positions: head (4,3) from previous? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 48 start: snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nAfter action R to (4,3):\n\n- Head moves to (4,3)\n\n- Since no food at (4,3), not eaten, so snake does not grow, tail is removed. Tail was (5,3), removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then the body segments shift: the old head (3,3) becomes segment 2, but positions: the list shifts, so new list: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] and tail is (6,3)? Original had 11 segments, after move, head moved to (4,3), tail (5,3) removed, so now 10 segments: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]? Let's list:\n\nOld positions: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter move R to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nThen body: the previous positions from index 0 to 9 become the new body, but shifted: new segment 1: old head (3,3), segment 2: old segment 1 (3,4), segment 3: old segment 2 (2,4), ..., up to old segment 9 (6,3), and old tail (5,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,3) is now the last segment, tail.\n\nOld segment 9 is (6,3), which was not tail, now becomes tail.\n\nYes: new tail is (6,3).\n\nAnd (6,3) has food, but it's occupied by the snake now.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,3), can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is now occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\n(4,4) : is it free? Not in positions, should be free.\n\n(4,2) free, (5,3) free? (5,3) was removed, so free now.\n\nIn new positions, cells occupied: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,3).\n\nSo (5,3) is free, (4,4) free, etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go R to (5,3), which is free.\n\nOr U to (4,4), or D to (4,2), or L to (3,3) but occupied, so not possible.\n\nSo actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, if I want to go to (6,2), from here, going R to (5,3) might be good.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (5,3).\n\nThen head to (5,3), which is free, no food there, so no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,3) removed? Old tail was (6,3), removed.\n\nNew segments: head (5,3), then previous: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,3) is gone, so tail is (6,4)? List: new head (5,3), segment 1: (4,3), segment 2: (3,3), segment 3: (3,4), segment 4: (2,4), segment 5: (2,5), segment 6: (3,5), segment 7: (4,5), segment 8: (5,5), segment 9: (5,4), segment 10: (6,4) tail.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\n(6,3) is now free, and it has food, so I can eat it if I move there.\n\nBut head is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (6,3) right.\n\nAlso, (6,2) is below (6,3), but I need to go to (6,3) first.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go R to (6,3), which has food.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe? Tail is at (6,4), which is above (6,3), so not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (5,3), tail at (6,4), distance |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (6,3), I eat the food, so snake grows, tail does not move.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,3), and since I ate, the tail stays, so positions: head (6,3), body includes the old tail (6,4), and so on.\n\nNew length 11 segments.\n\nBut (6,3) was the food cell, now head is there.\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,2) to eat that food, but (6,2) has different food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, if I go R to (4,3), then turn 49 go R to (5,3), then turn 50 go R to (6,3) to eat the food.\n\nBut on turn 50, when I go to (6,3), it has food, I eat it, grow.\n\nLife span of (6,3) food is 8 at turn 48, so on turn 50, it should be life span 6 or something? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 48: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 48, life span 7\n\nTurn 49: life span 7, after turn 49, life span 6\n\nTurn 50: life span 6, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) turn 48 life span 6, after turn 48 life 5, turn 49 life 5, after turn 49 life 4, turn 50 life 4.\n\nBack to action.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 50, if I go to (6,3), I eat food, grow.\n\nThen head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen I can go D to (6,2) to eat the other food.\n\n(6,2) has food, so if I go there, eat another, grow more.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating (6,3) on turn 50, positions: head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and since I ate, tail didn't move, so (6,4) is still there? When I ate at (6,3), the tail (6,4) remains, so positions: head (6,3), segment 1: (5,3), segment 2: (4,3), ..., segment 10: (5,4), segment 11: (6,4) tail.\n\nOld positions before move: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nMove to (6,3): eat food, so head to (6,3), and tail does not move, so the body is: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — all kept, and new head, so 12 segments now.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, from (6,3), I can go D to (6,2), which has food, so eat it, grow again.\n\n(6,2) life span: turn 50, life span 4, can be eaten.\n\nMove D to (6,2): eat food, head to (6,2), tail doesn't move.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (6,4) tail? Body includes (6,3) which is previous head, and (5,3), etc., and (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter this, tail at (6,4).\n\nBut (6,2) is below, and walls at y=0, so (6,2) to (6,1) down, but y=0 is wall, so I might be trapped or something.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, if I go R, I can potentially eat both foods by turn 51.\n\nTurn 48: R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 49: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 50: R to (6,3) eat first food\n\nTurn 51: D to (6,2) eat second food\n\nThen snake is longer, head at (6,2), with body above.\n\nBut (6,2) is at y=2, I can go left to (5,2), or down to (6,1), but y=0 is wall, so (6,1) is ok, or up to (6,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nIs this path safe? From current, when I go to (5,3) on turn 49, (5,3) was free, no issue.\n\nThen to (6,3) on turn 50, it was free since tail moved, and I eat.\n\nThen to (6,2) on turn 51, eat.\n\nBut (6,2) was free, no problem.\n\nAfter that, I have a long snake, and I'm near the wall.\n\nBut I can move left or down.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,6), but not relevant here.\n\nBut in this path, I eat two foods, good for score.\n\nBut I need to consider other moves.\n\nWhat if I go down from start?\n\nTurn 48: D to (3,2)\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) is free, no food.\n\nThen I need to go towards food, but (6,2) is at (6,2), so from (3,2), I can go right, but I have to avoid body.\n\nFor example, go R to (4,2), then (5,2), then (6,2).\n\nBut (5,2) and (6,2) may be free.\n\nBut (6,2) has food, life span short.\n\nLet's see the body after move.\n\nIf turn 48 D to (3,2):\n\nHead to (3,2), no eat, tail removed (5,3), so new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nTail at (6,3), which has food.\n\nNow head at (3,2), far from food.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go right and up or something.\n\nFrom (3,2), go R to (4,2), free.\n\nThen to (5,2), free? (5,2) not occupied.\n\nThen to (6,2), eat.\n\nBut (6,2) life span: at turn 48, life 6, if I go turn 48 D, turn 49 R to (4,2), turn 50 R to (5,2), turn 51 R to (6,2), but (6,2) to (5,2) is left, not right; from (5,2), to (6,2) is right.\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) go R to (6,2) eat.\n\nLife span: turn 48, (6,2) life 6\n\nAfter turn 48, life 5\n\nTurn 49, life 5, after turn 49 life 4\n\nTurn 50, life 4, after turn 50 life 3\n\nTurn 51, life 3, can be eaten, yes.\n\nBut I don't eat the (6,3) food, which has longer life.\n\nIn the first path, I eat both.\n\nNow, another option: go left to (2,3) on turn 48.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen I can go L to (1,3), or U to (2,4) but occupied, or D to (2,2), or R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo possible L to (1,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,4) is body, so cannot go up.\n\nGoing left might lead to dead end or away from food.\n\nNot efficient for eating food.\n\nSo better to go right or down.\n\nNow, back to the first plan: go R on turn 48 to (4,3), then R to (5,3) on turn 49, then R to (6,3) on turn 50 to eat first food.\n\nBut on turn 50, when I go to (6,3), it has food, but is there any danger?\n\nTail is at (6,4), which is above, so when I eat at (6,3), head is at (6,3), tail at (6,4), adjacent vertically? (6,3) and (6,4) are adjacent up-down.\n\nBut tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here, when I move to (6,3), the tail is at (6,4), not at (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has food, but tail is at (6,4), so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, head and tail are adjacent: head (6,3), tail (6,4), but that's fine as long as I don't eat food at tail cell.\n\nNow, on turn 51, I can go D to (6,2) to eat the other food.\n\n(6,2) has food, eat it.\n\nThen head at (6,2), and snake longer.\n\nBut now, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) but occupied by body, D to (6,1), L to (5,2), or R but x=7 wall, so R not possible.\n\nx=7 is wall, so from (6,2), can go U, D, L.\n\nBut U to (6,3) occupied, so only D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf I go D to (6,1), then to (6,0) but y=0 wall, so (6,0) not allowed, so I can go down only to (6,1), then I have to go left or right, but right x=7 wall, so only left to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut I might get trapped.\n\nSince I ate two foods, snake is longer, 13 segments or something.\n\nAfter turn 50, after eating (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail. 12 segments? Head + 11 body, 12 total.\n\nThen turn 51: D to (6,2) eat, so head to (6,2), tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail. 13 segments.\n\nNow, from (6,2), I can go L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I go L to (5,2), that might be better to avoid the corner.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut the point is, in this sequence, I eat both foods quickly.\n\nNow, what about the life span: (6,2) is eaten on turn 51, which is within life span since available until turn 53.\n\n(6,3) eaten on turn 50, within life span.\n\nNow, but I need to think about survival after that.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nBut is there a risk in moving to (5,3) on turn 49?\n\n(5,3) was tail, but no food, so safe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,3) on turn 50, it was free because the tail moved away? On turn 49, after moving to (5,3), tail is at (6,4), and (6,3) is free, so yes.\n\nIn the positions after turn 49: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,3) is free, and has food.\n\nSo moving to (6,3) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) free.\n\nNow, for turn 48, I could go down to (3,2), but that delays reaching the food.\n\nFor example, turn 48 D to (3,2), then turn 49 R to (4,2), turn 50 R to (5,2), turn 51 R to (6,2) eat (6,2).\n\nBut I don't eat (6,3), and (6,3) might be eaten later, but with longer life, I can.\n\nBut eating both now is better for score.\n\nMoreover, by going right first, I free up (6,3) and eat it immediately.\n\nNow, about the direction: when I go R on turn 48, head direction becomes R.\n\nThen turn 49 go R, direction R.\n\nTurn 50 go R to (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 51 go D to (6,2), direction D.\n\nAll fine, no reverse issues.\n\nNow, after eating both, I need to plan to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for turns 48 to 52 or so.\n\nIn this sequence, turn 48: R, turn 49: R, turn 50: R (eat), turn 51: D (eat), then turn 52: I need to choose, say L to (5,2) or D to (6,1).\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should output 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn 48, so turns 48 to 52.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 48: R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 49: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 50: R to (6,3) eat\n\nTurn 51: D to (6,2) eat\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2), I need to move, say L to (5,2) to avoid corner.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nThen I can go to (5,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut for now, that seems fine.\n\nI could consider not eating (6,2) if it's risky, but here it seems ok.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nWhat about moving down first?\n\nTurn 48: D to (3,2)\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 49: I can go R to (4,2) or L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nSay go R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,2) go R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2) go R to (6,2) eat (6,2)\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2) go U to (6,3) but (6,3) may have food, but at that point, if I didn't eat it, life span decreases.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 51, when I eat (6,2), but (6,3) is still occupied? No, after moves.\n\nAfter turn 48 D to (3,2): positions head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\n(6,3) has food and is tail.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), far.\n\nTurn 49 go R to (4,2): head to (4,2), no eat, tail removed (6,3), so (6,3) becomes free, but food is there.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,3) free with food.\n\nBut I'm at (4,2), not close.\n\nThen turn 50 go R to (5,2): head to (5,2), no eat, tail removed (6,4), so new tail is (5,4)? Positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\n(6,4) removed, tail at (5,4).\n\n(6,3) still free with food.\n\nThen turn 51 go R to (6,2): eat food at (6,2), head to (6,2), grow, tail stays.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nNow, (6,3) is free with food, adjacent to head (6,2).\n\nI can go U to (6,3) to eat it on turn 52.\n\nBut head at (6,2), tail at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nGo U to (6,3) eat, then grow.\n\nBut after that, I might be stuck.\n\nCompared to the first plan, I eat (6,2) on turn 51, and (6,3) on turn 52, but in first plan I ate both earlier.\n\nIn terms of score, same two foods, but in first plan I ate on turn 50 and 51, here on 51 and 52.\n\nBut (6,2) life span: if I eat on turn 51, it's within, since turn 53 last chance.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the first plan, I have the option to not go to (6,2) if I don't want, but I can.\n\nI think the first path is more direct.\n\nMoreover, in the first path, when I go to (6,3) on turn 50, I free the area and eat immediately.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should output the actions.\n\nBut I need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, after turn 51, I have turn 52.\n\nIn first plan: after turn 51, head at (6,2), I can go L to (5,2) on turn 52.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, let's list:\n\nTurn 48: R (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 49: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 50: R (to (6,3), eat)\n\nTurn 51: D (to (6,2), eat)\n\nTurn 52: L (to (5,2))\n\nAll these moves are possible and safe.\n\nAfter turn 52, head at (5,2), and so on.\n\nI could consider if going down first avoids something, but I don't see immediate risk.\n\nAnother point: the food at (6,3) was under body, and I freed it by moving the snake.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the grid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), which is not in the way.\n\nWalls borders.\n\nSo I think this plan is good.\n\nBut in turn 52, I go L to (5,2), but I need to think about survival beyond, but for the answer, up to turn 52 is fine.\n\nSince turn 48 to 52 is 5 turns.\n\nt1=48, t1 to t1+4? t1=48, turn 48,49,50,51,52: that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the action, for turn 50 and 51, I eat food, which is good.\n\nIf I go down first, I might eat only one, or later.\n\nBut here I eat both.\n\nIs there negative food? No, only positive in this state.\n\nSo I think maximize by eating both.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating both if it traps me, but here, after eating, I can go left to open space.\n\nFor example, after (5,2), I can go down or left, etc.\n\nSo no immediate trap.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with this sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: R\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: D\n\nTurn 52: L\n\nBut for turn 52, I need to specify based on state, but since I plan, and it should be consistent.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 48 to 52, thinking 5 turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (6,2) before it disappears (life span 6, so it must be eaten by turn 53).\n- Eat the positive food at (6,3) after freeing it from under the snake's body (life span 8, so more time is available, but eating it soon is efficient for score).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body.\n- Ensure the snake does not get trapped in a corner after eating.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 48)\n- **Snake head**: At (3,3), moving down (D).\n- **Snake body**: Occupies cells including (6,3), which has food. The food at (6,3) can only be eaten once the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 53).\n  - (6,3): Value +1, life span 8 (available until turn 55), but currently under the snake's body (segment at (6,3)).\n- **Immediate moves from (3,3)**: \n  - Down (D) to (3,2): Free, but moves away from food and may delay reaching (6,2).\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Free, but moves away from food and into a less open area.\n  - Right (R) to (4,3): Free and directly towards the food. Best for efficiency.\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving to (6,3) when it is the tail cell could cause tail reward danger, but at turn 48, (6,3) is not the tail (tail is at (5,3)).\n  - After eating both foods, the snake will be longer (13 segments), so movement near walls (e.g., x=7, y=0) must be cautious.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5 Turns Ahead)\nThe optimal sequence moves right immediately to position for eating both foods quickly:\n- **Turn 48: R (right to (4,3))** - Moves toward the food cluster. Head now at (4,3), direction right. No food eaten. Tail removed, so (6,3) is freed (now has food and is unoccupied).\n- **Turn 49: R (right to (5,3))** - Moves to the former tail cell (5,3). Since (5,3) has no food, it is safe (tail moves away). Head now at (5,3), direction right. (6,3) is still free and has food.\n- **Turn 50: R (right to (6,3))** - Eats the food at (6,3) (value +1, snake grows to 12 segments). Head now at (6,3), direction right. This is safe: (6,3) was free, and tail was at (6,4), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n- **Turn 51: D (down to (6,2))** - Eats the food at (6,2) (value +1, snake grows to 13 segments). Head now at (6,2), direction down. This is safe and within the life span (eaten on turn 51, before turn 53 expiry).\n- **Turn 52: L (left to (5,2))** - Avoids the corner at (6,2) by moving left to open space. Head now at (5,2), direction left. This sets up for future movement (e.g., down to (5,1) or left to (4,2)) to explore the bottom-left area and avoid dead ends.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Score maximized**: Eats both +1 foods by turn 51, adding 2 to the score and increasing length by 2.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - No wall or body collisions (all target cells are free when moved to).\n  - No tail reward danger: When eating at (6,3) on turn 50, head was not adjacent to tail (tail at (6,4)).\n  - Turn 52 move to (5,2) ensures the snake does not get trapped near the wall at y=0 or x=7.\n- **Efficiency**: Reaches (6,2) in minimal turns (Manhattan distance 4, eaten on turn 51), and frees/eats (6,3) opportunistically.\n- **Long-term survival focus**: After turn 52, the snake can move to open cells (e.g., (5,1) or (4,2)) to avoid risks. The internal obstacle at (3,6) is irrelevant here.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 49: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 50: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 51: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 52: L (left)\n}",

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to be careful with the coordinates. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\nCurrent turn is 49.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), and the body segments are: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). The last position is (6,3), which is the tail.\n\nSnake head direction is R, meaning it's moving right.

But from the positions, the head is at (4,3), and the previous position is (3,3), so it came from left to (4,3), so direction should be R, yes.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, (6,3) has food, but (6,3) is also the tail position of the snake. Let's see: snake positions include (6,3), which is the tail. And food is at (6,3) with life span 7.\n\nBut according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: let's list positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nBody: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nSo tail is at (6,3)\n\nFood at:\n\n- (6,2) life 5\n\n- (6,3) life 7  // under tail\n\n- (5,3) life 10\n\nAll value 1.\n\nCurrent turn t=49.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current head position (4,3) with direction R.\n\nSince head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be opposite direction. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L (left). Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nFirst, move R: to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is a food position? Food is at (5,3), yes. So moving to (5,3) would eat the food there, since it's not under the snake body currently? The snake is not on (5,3) now. Snake positions: (4,3), (3,3), etc., (5,3) is not listed, so it's free, I think.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). So (5,3) is not occupied by snake, and it has food, so moving to (5,3) would eat the food, increasing length by 1.\n\nValue is +1, so score up, length up.\n\nBut is (5,3) safe? Let's check collisions.\n\n(5,3): is it a wall? x=5, y=3, walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so no. Obstacle at (3,6), not here. So no wall collision.\n\nBody collision: snake body is at (3,3), (5,5), etc., (5,3) is not in the body positions, so moving to (5,3) is safe and eats food.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move this turn, and new segment added.\n\nNow, move U: to (4,4)\n\n(4,4): is it occupied? Snake has (4,3) head, (4,5) is body, but (4,4) not listed. Food? Not mentioned, so probably empty and safe.\n\ny=4, x=4.\n\nWalls: no. Body: positions don't include (4,4), so safe.\n\nMove D: to (4,2)\n\n(4,2): not in snake positions, no food mentioned, walls no, so should be safe.\n\nBut y=2, within 1-6.\n\nNow, also, there is food at (6,2) and (6,3), but (6,3) is under tail.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (5,3). It has life span 10, so it will disappear at turn 49 + 10 = 59, but since we're at turn 49, and life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span decreases by one each turn.\n\nLife span: when food spawns, it has N turns. Each turn, life decreases. So at turn 49, for (5,3), life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning on turn 60 it will be gone? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn 49, food has its life span. After the snake moves, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nTypically, in such games, at the beginning of the turn, the state is given, then snake moves, and if it eats food, it consumes it; if not, the food remains with decreased life.\n\nBut for life span, it decreases every turn, including the current turn when it is present.\n\nSo for food at (5,3), life span 10 at turn 49. If not eaten on turn 49, at turn 50, life span becomes 9, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(6,2) life 5: at turn 49, life 5. If not eaten, turn 50 life 4, etc.\n\n(6,3) life 7: at turn 49, life 7.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nCurrent possible actions: U, D, R (since cannot L)\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I eat the food there. Snake grows, so new head at (5,3), and tail stays where it is, so tail is still at (6,3), and new segment added after head.\n\nAfter eating, the snake length increases by one, so the tail doesn't move for this turn.\n\nThen for next turn, the tail will move as usual.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (6,2) and (6,3), but (6,3) is currently occupied by tail.\n\nTail is at (6,3) with food under it.\n\nTo eat that, the tail must move away, then head moves in.\n\nBut there's Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision because when you eat, the tail grows but head is on the same cell, so collision.\n\nSpecifically: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head is at (4,3), tail at (6,3). Are they adjacent? (4,3) to (6,3) is two cells apart in x, same y, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (4,3) and (6,3) are not adjacent; (5,3) is between them.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, if I move to (5,3), that's adjacent to tail (6,3).\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), head is at (5,3), tail at (6,3), and I ate food, so snake grows.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), the new head is at (5,3), and since I ate, the tail does not move, so tail remains at (6,3). The new segment is added, so the body extends, but the tail position stays.\n\nThen, on the next turn, when I move, the tail will move forward.\n\nBut for now, after turn 49 move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, so snake: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) — and tail at (6,3) still, since no move for tail after eating.\n\nWhen snake eats, the tail stays, so length increases by one, positions: new head at food cell, and the previous positions remain, with tail fixed.\n\nThen next turn, when snake moves, tail moves as well.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3) and eating, snake positions: head (5,3), then the rest: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) — so tail is (6,3).\n\nNow, head at (5,3), tail at (6,3), which are adjacent horizontally.\n\nFood is still at (6,3) under tail.\n\nIf I were to move to (6,3) now, head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, so if I eat it, it would cause collision because after eating, the tail grows to where the head was, but head is on the food, which was tail position, so the new tail is added, but since head moved to tail position, and tail was there, it might cause collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSpecifically, when you eat the food at tail, the head moves to that cell, and since you ate, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added at the tail position, I think? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving head to food, the body follows, but tail doesn't advance, so the position where tail was remains, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nLet's clarify snake movement.\n\nNormally, when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from its position.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, but the tail does not move, so the tail position stays, and the new segment is effectively added at the tail, so the snake occupies one more cell.\n\nFor example, if tail is at S, and head moves to food F, then positions: head F, then body as before, tail still at S, so now S is part of the body, and the new tail is S, but since tail didn't move, it's like the snake extended.\n\nIn terms of positions, the tail cell remains occupied.\n\nNow, for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, and head moves to tail cell to eat it.\n\nAfter moving head to tail cell (which has food), now head is at that cell, and since you ate, the snake grows, so the tail position does not change; it stays where it was. But that cell is now occupied by head, so the tail segment is still there? Conflict.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the growth happens: the tail does not move this turn, so the new segment is added, meaning that the position where the tail was remains occupied, and head is at new position.\n\nBut if head moves to the tail position, which has food, then after moving, head is at the former tail position, and since you ate, the tail does not move, so that cell is now head, and the tail is still there? But it can't be two segments on same cell.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nIn snake games, typically, the head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied or something, but here, moving to tail is allowed because tail moves away, but only if not eating.\n\nBut when eating at tail, it's a problem.\n\nThe rule states: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows by keeping the tail in place for that turn. So, if head moves to a cell that was tail, but tail is moving away if not eating, but when eating, tail stays.\n\nSo, if head moves to tail cell to eat food, after move, head is at the tail cell, and tail is also at that cell for this turn because it didn't move, so collision occurs immediately, or the new segment is added at the tail position but head is there, so conflict.\n\nThus, it's deadly.\n\nHence the danger.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,3), head at (5,3), tail at (6,3), adjacent.\n\nIf I then move to (6,3), which has food under it, but since head is adjacent to tail, and I move to tail cell, it would cause death.\n\nBut only if I actually eat it, meaning head moves to it.\n\nBut at (6,3), there is food, and if I move there, I would eat it only if it's accessible.\n\nBut with Tail Reward Danger, it's fatal.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFirst, option to move R to (5,3) at turn 49.\n\nThat seems good, eat food, grow, and (5,3) is safe.\n\nThen, from there, I need to think next moves.\n\nOther options: move U to (4,4) or D to (4,2).\n\nNow, food at (6,2) and (6,3) are closer to the tail area.\n\nAlso, (6,3) food is under tail, so to eat it, tail must move away first.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (6,3), and it will move when the snake moves without eating, or when it moves.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0,7 y=0,7, obstacle at (3,6).\n\nSnake: head (4,3)\n\nBody: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail\n\nFood: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(6,3) is tail, so food under it.\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nLife spans: (6,2) life 5, so if not eaten by turn 53 (since 49+4=53, life 5 at 49, after 49 move if not eaten, life 4 at 50, ..., so disappears when life=0, after turn 53? At turn 49, life=5, after turn 49, if not eaten, life=4 at start of turn 50. Turn 50 start life=4, after move if not eaten life=3, ..., at turn 53 start life=1, after move if not eaten life=0 and disappears, so last chance to eat is on turn 53.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life=7, disappears after turn 55 (turn 49 life=7, turn 50 life=6, ..., turn 55 life=1, turn 56 life=0 disappear).\n\n(5,3) life=10, disappears after turn 58.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score, so eat all possible, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 11 segments, so space is limited.\n\nPlayable grid: 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle (3,6), so 35 cells. Snake occupies 11, so 24 free, but with food.\n\nBut snake can move.\n\nNow, let's consider the moves.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,3) at turn 49.\n\nEat food at (5,3), snake grows to 12 segments.\n\nPositions after turn 49: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nFood at (5,3) eaten, so removed.\n\nFood still: (6,2) life now? After turn 49, if not eaten, life decreases. But (6,2) not eaten, so at turn 50, life=4 for (6,2), similarly (6,3) life=6 (since at 49 it was 7, after decrease).\n\nAt start of turn 49, life: (6,2)=5, (6,3)=7, (5,3)=10.\n\nAfter snake move on turn 49:\n\nIf snake moves to (5,3), eats it, so (5,3) food consumed.\n\n(6,2) and (6,3) not eaten, so their life decrease by 1 at end of turn or after move.\n\nTypically, after the snake moves, uneaten food has life decreased.\n\nSo after turn 49, (6,2) life=4, (6,3) life=6.\n\nThen turn 50 start with that.\n\nNow, from head at (5,3), direction: since I moved R to (5,3), current direction is R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, opposite).\n\nMove U to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by body? Positions: after turn 49, (5,4) is body, yes, from above, (5,4) is part of snake, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (5,2): is (5,2) free? No snake there, no wall, so possible.\n\nMove R to (6,3): (6,3) is tail, and has food. But head at (5,3) is adjacent to tail at (6,3), so if I move to (6,3), I would eat the food, but Tail Reward Danger: since head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes death. So cannot move to (6,3).\n\nThus, from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4) but occupied, D to (5,2), or R to (6,3) but deadly, so only possible is D to (5,2)? U is occupied, R is deadly, so only D to (5,2) is safe? What about other directions?\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I can move U, D, R. L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nU to (5,4): occupied, body at (5,4).\n\nR to (6,3): deadly.\n\nD to (5,2): let's see, (5,2) is within bounds, y=2, x=5. Walls: x=5 not wall, y=2 not wall. Obstacle no. Snake positions: not occupied, so free. No food mentioned, so empty.\n\nSo only safe move is D to (5,2).\n\nThen, after moving to (5,2), no eat, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 49, if I move R to (5,3), then at turn 50, I have to move to (5,2) or something else? Only D seems possible.\n\nBut (5,4) is occupied, so cannot go up.\n\nWhat about left? Cannot, because direction R, cannot reverse to L.\n\nSo from (5,3) with direction R, only possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nU: (5,4) occupied, collision.\n\nR: (6,3) deadly if eat.\n\nD: (5,2) safe.\n\nSo must move D to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 50: move D to (5,2)\n\nNow, head to (5,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nPrevious tail was (6,3), and since no eat, tail moves away.\n\nSnake positions after turn 50: head (5,2), then body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — and tail moves from (6,3) to where? The segment before tail is (6,4), so tail moves to (6,4)? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: before move, at turn 49 end: positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nHead is (5,3), tail is (6,3)\n\nNow, move head to (5,2), no eat.\n\nSo new head: (5,2)\n\nThen body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (5,3), then next to previous first body (4,3), and so on, up to the segment before tail moves to previous position of the one ahead.\n\nThe segment that was at (6,4) moves to previous position of (6,3)? Let's list the segments in order.\n\nSegments: index 0: head (5,3)\n\nIndex 1: (4,3)\n\nIndex 2: (3,3)\n\nIndex 3: (3,4)\n\nIndex 4: (2,4)\n\nIndex 5: (2,5)\n\nIndex 6: (3,5)\n\nIndex 7: (4,5)\n\nIndex 8: (5,5)\n\nIndex 9: (5,4)\n\nIndex 10: (6,4)\n\nIndex 11: tail (6,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head: (5,2)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to old head (5,3)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old seg1 (4,3)\n\nSegment 3 moves to old seg2 (3,3)\n\nSegment 4 moves to old seg3 (3,4)\n\nSegment 5 moves to old seg4 (2,4)\n\nSegment 6 moves to old seg5 (2,5)\n\nSegment 7 moves to old seg6 (3,5)\n\nSegment 8 moves to old seg7 (4,5)\n\nSegment 9 moves to old seg8 (5,5)\n\nSegment 10 moves to old seg9 (5,4)\n\nSegment 11 (tail) moves to old seg10 (6,4)\n\nSo new tail is at (6,4)\n\nAnd the cell (6,3) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nFood at (6,3) is now exposed, since body moved away.\n\nLife span of (6,3) was 6 at turn 50 start, after not eaten on turn 50, life decreases to 5? At turn 50 start, after turn 49, (6,3) life=6.\n\nAfter snake move on turn 50 to (5,2), not eating (6,3), so (6,3) food life decreases to 5.\n\nNow head at (5,2), direction: moved D, so now direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,2), can move U, D, L, R? But direction D, so cannot move U (opposite), so can move L, R, D.\n\nMove D to (5,1): but y=1, walls at y=0, so y=1 is ok, but is it wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is within, no wall.\n\n(5,1) not occupied, probably free.\n\nMove L to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) not occupied, free.\n\nMove R to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) has food, life span now? At turn 50 start, (6,2) life=4, after not eaten on turn 50, life=3? Let's keep track.\n\nBut I can go to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nFirst, back to turn 49.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I eat one food, but then I am forced to move D to (5,2) on turn 50, and then from there I can go to (6,2) to eat another food, or elsewhere.\n\nBut I have to think long-term survival.\n\nAnother option at turn 49: move D to (4,2)\n\nFrom (4,3) move D to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is free, no food, no collision.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nSimilarly, move U to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is free? Snake positions have (4,3) and (4,5), but not (4,4), so free, no food.\n\nMove to (4,4), no eat.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut I need to consider the food.\n\nFood at (6,2) has short life, only 5 turns, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) under tail, but tail will move if I don't eat and snake moves.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 49, tail will move on turn 50 if I move without eating.\n\nLet's consider not eating at turn 49.\n\nOption: move D to (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nFrom (4,3) move D to (4,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nPrevious tail at (6,3) moves to where? Current positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nMove head to (4,2), no eat.\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen body: segment 1 to (4,3) old head\n\nSegment 2 to (3,3) old seg1\n\n...\nUp to segment 10 to old seg9 (6,4)?

Old seg10 is (6,3), so tail moves to where? The last segment moves to the previous position of the second last? In the list, old seg9 is (6,4), old seg10 is (6,3).\n\nAfter move, new segment 1 is old head (4,3)\n\nNew segment 2 is old seg1 (3,3)\n\n...\n\nNew segment 9 is old seg8 (5,4)\n\nNew segment 10 is old seg9 (6,4)\n\nAnd tail was old seg10 (6,3), but since no new segment, tail is removed, so new tail is at (6,4), and (6,3) is free.\n\nSince no eat, the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo (6,3) is now free, and food is there, exposed.\n\nLife span of (6,3): at turn 49 start life=7, after not eaten on turn 49, life=6 at turn 50 start.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life=4 at turn 50 start.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D.\n\nFrom here, I can move to eat food.\n\nFor example, move to (5,2) or (4,3) but (4,3) is now body, occupied.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2) with direction D: cannot move U (opposite), so L, R, D.\n\nMove L to (3,2): free?\n\n(3,2) not occupied, no wall.\n\nMove R to (5,2): free, no food.\n\nMove D to (4,1): y=1, ok.\n\nThen from (5,2) or (3,2), I can go towards the food.\n\nBut (6,2) has short life, so I should head there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is now exposed.\n\nBut let's compare options.\n\nAnother option at turn 49: move U to (4,4)\n\nFrom (4,3) move U to (4,4), no food, no eat, tail moves.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen positions after move: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), etc., tail moves from (6,3) to (6,4), so (6,3) free, food exposed.\n\nBut (4,4) is away from the food, and (6,2) has short life, so I might miss it.\n\nLife span 5, must eat by turn 53.\n\nFrom (4,4), it might take more turns to reach (6,2).\n\nFor example, from (4,4) to (6,2) is at least 2 moves right and 2 down, but with body, it might be longer.\n\nBut not efficient.\n\nSo better to go down or right to target the food.\n\nNow, back to the first option: if I move R to (5,3) at turn 49, I eat one food, but then I am at (5,3) and forced to move down to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move to (6,2) to eat the food there on turn 50 or 51.\n\nLet's simulate that.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (5,3), eat food at (5,3), snake grows to 12 segments.\n\nPositions after turn 49: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail. 12 positions.\n\nFood: (5,3) eaten, removed. (6,2) life=4 at turn 50 start, (6,3) life=6 at turn 50 start.\n\nTurn 50: from (5,3), as we said, only possible move is D to (5,2), since U and R are blocked or deadly.\n\nMove D to (5,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nThen body: segment 1 to (5,3) old head\n\nSegment 2 to (4,3) old seg1\n\nSegment 3 to (3,3) old seg2\n\nSegment 4 to (3,4) old seg3\n\nSegment 5 to (2,4) old seg4\n\nSegment 6 to (2,5) old seg5\n\nSegment 7 to (3,5) old seg6\n\nSegment 8 to (4,5) old seg7\n\nSegment 9 to (5,5) old seg8\n\nSegment 10 to (5,4) old seg9\n\nSegment 11 to (6,4) old seg10\n\nTail was (6,3), but since no eat, it moves to old seg11 position? Old seg11 is (6,3), so new segment 11 is old seg10 (6,4)\n\nAnd new tail is at (6,4)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: head (5,2)\n\n1: (5,3)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)\n\n4: (3,4)\n\n5: (2,4)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (5,4)\n\n11: (6,4)  // this was old seg10\n\nOld tail (6,3) is gone, so positions: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — 12 segments, tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,3) is now free, food there with life=6 at turn 50 start, after not eaten, life=5 at turn 51 start? After turn 50 move, not eaten, life decreases to 5 for (6,3).\n\n(6,2) life=4 at turn 50 start, after not eaten, life=3 at turn 51 start.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,2), direction D, so cannot move U (opposite), so can move L, R, D.\n\nMove D to (5,1): y=1, free, no food.\n\nMove L to (4,2): free, no food.\n\nMove R to (6,2): (6,2) has food, and it's free, no snake, so can move to eat.\n\n(6,2) is adjacent, and no body, so safe to eat.\n\nMove R to (6,2) on turn 51? Turn 50 just happened, we are at turn 51 now.\n\nTurn 50: we moved to (5,2), so for turn 51, head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nMove R to (6,2): that would eat the food at (6,2).\n\nIs it safe? (6,2) is free, no collision.\n\nSo on turn 51, move R to (6,2), eat food, grow to 13 segments.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail stays at (6,4) since eat.\n\nAfter eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nSo positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nFood at (6,2) eaten.\n\n(6,3) food still there, life=5 at turn 51 start, after not eaten, life=4 at turn 52 start.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction: moved R, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (cannot L).\n\nMove U to (6,3): (6,3) has food, and head at (6,2) is adjacent to (6,3), but (6,3) is not tail, tail is at (6,4).\n\nTail is at (6,4), head at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\n(6,3) is free cell with food, so moving to (6,3) would eat the food.\n\nNo Tail Reward Danger because tail is not at (6,3), it's at (6,4).\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nMove to (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nEat food, grow to 14 segments.\n\nThen head at (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail at (6,4).\n\nThen from there, I can move, for example, up or down.\n\nBut the grid is getting crowded.\n\nNow, back to turn 49, if I don't move to (5,3), but move down to (4,2).\n\nTurn 49: move D to (4,2), no eat, tail moves, (6,3) freed.\n\nPositions after turn 49: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail at (6,4)? After move, new tail at (6,4), (6,3) free.\n\nFood at (6,3) exposed, life=6 at turn 50 start.\n\n(6,2) life=4 at turn 50 start.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2), move towards food, say move R to (5,2), no food, or directly to (6,2) but not adjacent, so need to go to (5,2) first.\n\nMove R to (5,2), no food there.\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), etc., tail moves to (6,4) or something.\n\nAfter move to (5,2), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), ..., (6,4) tail.\n\nMove to (5,2), new head (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (6,4) but tail moves.\n\nNew segment 1: (4,2) old head\n\nSegment 2: (4,3) old seg1\n\n...\n\nSegment 10: (5,4) old seg9? Old positions: seg1 was (4,3), seg2 (3,3), ..., let's not list all.\n\nAfter move, tail is at (5,4) or something.\n\n(6,3) food still there, life decreases.\n\nThen turn 51, from (5,2) move R to (6,2), eat food at (6,2), grow.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't eat the (5,3) food, so I missed one.\n\nIn the first option, by moving R at turn 49, I ate (5,3), then D to (5,2), then R to (6,2) eat, then U to (6,3) eat, so I eat all three foods quickly.\n\nIn the second option, if I move D at turn 49, I go to (4,2), then to (5,2), then to (6,2) eat, then to (6,3) eat, but I missed (5,3), which has longer life, but I could go back, but it might be gone or risky.\n\n(5,3) life 10, so I have time, but with snake long, it might be harder to maneuver.\n\nIn first option, I eat all three in four turns: turn 49 eat (5,3), turn 50 move D to (5,2), turn 51 eat (6,2), turn 52 eat (6,3).\n\nThen I have a longer snake.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nNow, after eating all, snake is at (6,3) head, (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail. 14 segments.\n\nGrid 6x6=36 cells minus obstacle (3,6), so 35 cells, snake 14, 21 free.\n\nBut I need to find space to move.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), I can move U to (6,4) but (6,4) is tail, and has no food? (6,4) is body, occupied.\n\nMove U to (6,4): occupied, collision.\n\nMove D to (6,2): but (6,2) is body, occupied.\n\nMove R: x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nMove L to (5,3): (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied except possibly down or left, but (6,2) down occupied, (5,3) left occupied, (6,4) up occupied, right wall.\n\nHead at (6,3), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,4) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (6,2) - occupied by body\n\n- Left: (5,3) - occupied by body\n\n- Right: (7,3) - wall, cannot move\n\nAll directions blocked? That's a problem.\n\nAfter eating (6,3) on turn 52, positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nNow, adjacent to head (6,3):\n\n- North (U): (6,4) - occupied by the segment that was tail, now body\n\n- South (D): (6,2) - occupied by the second segment\n\n- West (L): (5,3) - occupied by the fourth segment? Positions: index 0 head (6,3), index 1 (6,2), index 2 (5,2), index 3 (5,3), index 4 (4,3), etc.\n\nSo (6,4) is index 13, (5,3) is index 3, all occupied.\n\nAnd east is wall.\n\nSo indeed, no possible move, snake dies immediately on next turn.\n\nOh no! So if I follow that path, after eating the last food, I am trapped and die.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,3) at turn 49 leads to death later.\n\nBad idea.\n\nI need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps at some point, I should not eat a food to avoid growing and trapping myself.\n\nFor example, at turn 51, when at (5,2), instead of moving to (6,2) to eat, I could move elsewhere to avoid the trap.\n\nBut (6,2) has short life, if I don't eat it, it disappears soon.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 49, so at turn 50 life=4, turn 51 life=3, turn 52 life=2, turn 53 life=1, after turn 53 if not eaten, disappears.\n\nSo I need to eat by turn 53.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) by turn 55.\n\n(5,3) by turn 58.\n\nBut with the trap issue.\n\nAnother option at turn 49: move U to (4,4)\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTail moves, (6,3) freed.\n\nThen I can go towards (6,2) or other.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the (5,3) food at all, since it has long life, and focus on the others first with shorter life.\n\nBut I need to plan a path to eat without trapping.\n\nThe problem is that after eating all, the snake is in a corner.\n\nFrom the initial position, the snake is coiled, and eating the foods brings it to (6,3) with body around.\n\nI need to eat in a different order or leave some food.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nThen turn 50, from (4,2) move R to (5,2)\n\nNo eat.\n\nThen turn 51, from (5,2) move R to (6,2), eat food at (6,2), grow.\n\nPositions after turn 51: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail at (6,4) since ate, so tail stays, positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail. 13 segments? Initial was 11, ate one, so 12.\n\nInitial snake 11 segments.\n\nTurn 49 move D to (4,2), no eat, snake still 11, tail moved.\n\nTurn 50 move R to (5,2), no eat, tail moved.\n\nTurn 51 move R to (6,2), eat, so grow to 12 segments.\n\nPositions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,3) food is there, life at turn 51 start: after turn 49, (6,3) life=6, turn 50 not eaten life=5, turn 51 not eaten yet, after move life=4.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (cannot L).\n\nMove U to (6,3): (6,3) has food, and head at (6,2) is not adjacent to tail, tail at (6,4), so can move to (6,3) to eat.\n\nThen eat (6,3), grow to 13 segments.\n\nHead (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nNow, adjacent cells: U (6,4) occupied by tail, D (6,2) occupied by body, L (5,3) not occupied? (5,3) is free, no snake there, and it has food but we may not eat now.\n\n(5,3) is free, so I can move L to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) has food, life span at turn 52 start: after turn 51, if not eaten, life=9 or something, but we can eat it.\n\nBut first, from (6,3), move L to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is not occupied, so safe.\n\nMove to (5,3), eat food, grow to 14 segments.\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail at (6,4).\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,3), direction L, so cannot move R (opposite), can move U, D, L.\n\nMove U to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied? Positions: after eating, body includes (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\n(5,4) is occupied, so cannot move U.\n\nMove D to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by body.\n\nMove L to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by body.\n\nAll adjacent cells occupied except possibly down or left, but (5,2) down occupied, (4,3) left occupied, (5,4) up occupied.\n\nTrapped again.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo eating all foods leads to trap.\n\nI need to avoid eating one of them or find a way to eat without closing the loop.\n\nPerhaps at turn 49, I should move to (4,4) or something to create space.\n\nLet's list all possible moves at turn 49.\n\nMove U to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is free, no food.\n\nMove to (4,4), no eat, tail moves, (6,3) freed.\n\nPositions after turn 49: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), tail at (6,4)? New tail at (6,4), (6,3) free with food.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction U.\n\nNow, I can move towards the food.\n\nFor example, move R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nMove U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nMove L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nMove D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied? Let's see.\n\nHead at (4,4)\n\nAdjacent:\n- U (4,5): occupied by body (index 6 or something, (4,5) is in positions)\n- D (4,3): occupied by body\n- L (3,4): occupied by body\n- R (5,4): occupied by body\n\nAll blocked! Immediately trapped after turn 49 if I move U.\n\nBecause the snake is coiled around.\n\nInitial positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nWhen head moves to (4,4), which was free, but after moving, the body is around it.\n\nBefore move, (4,4) was free, but after moving head to (4,4), the body segments are at (4,3), (3,3), etc., which surround (4,4).\n\nSo yes, trapped.\n\nSo moving U is not possible; it leads to immediate death.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (4,2) might be ok, as we saw earlier.\n\nMoving R to (5,3) eats food but leads to trap later.\n\nMoving D to (4,2) seems better.\n\nAt turn 49, move D to (4,2)\n\nThen as before, I can go to (5,2) then to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut to avoid trapping, I should not eat the (6,3) food or eat it later when I have space.\n\n(6,3) has life 7, so I have until turn 55.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can move away.\n\nTurn 49: move D to (4,2), no eat, tail moves, (6,3) freed.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,3) free with food.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2), no food, no eat, tail moves to (6,4) or something.\n\nPrevious tail at (6,4), moves to where? After move to (5,2), new positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail at (6,4)? Old seg10 was (6,4), new segment 10 is old seg9 (5,4), new tail is at (5,4)? Let's not detail.\n\n(6,4) is vacated, but no food there.\n\n(6,3) food still there.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2), eat food at (6,2), grow to 12 segments.\n\nPositions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail at (5,4) since ate, so tail stays.\n\nFood at (6,2) eaten.\n\n(6,3) food with life, say at turn 51 start life=5, after not eaten, life=4.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, R (cannot L).\n\nMove U to (6,3): (6,3) has food, and head at (6,2) is not adjacent to tail (tail at (5,4)), so can move to (6,3) to eat.\n\nBut if I eat, I grow to 13, and might be trapped.\n\nMove D to (6,1): free, no food.\n\nMove R: wall, cannot.\n\nMove U to (6,3) to eat or not.\n\nTo avoid trap, I should not eat (6,3) now.\n\nMove D to (6,1) instead.\n\nThen no eat, tail moves.\n\nHead to (6,1), no food.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, move to (5,1) or something.\n\nBut (6,3) food will disappear soon, but I can come back.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 49, so at turn 51 life=5, after decrease, turn 52 life=4, etc., until turn 55.\n\nI have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) food is still there.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1), I can go left or down.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nThe obstacle at (3,6) blocks the top row.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the left side.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat the foods if possible without dying.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 49, move R to (5,3) but then at turn 50, instead of moving D, I have to, but only D is possible.\n\nUnless I can move differently.\n\nFrom (5,3) after turn 49, only D is safe.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (5,3) at turn 49.\n\nMove D to (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nThen turn 50 move to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51 move to (6,2) eat.\n\nThen at turn 51, from (6,2), instead of moving U to (6,3), move D to (6,1).\n\nThen positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail. 12 segments.\n\nTail at (5,4).\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 52: can move L to (5,1), or D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, cannot, or R wall, or U to (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1), no food.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) is body, etc.\n\nBut I can try to go to (5,3) to eat the food there.\n\n(5,3) is free, with food.\n\nLife span 10, at turn 52, life=8 or something.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied.\n\nMove L to (4,1) or R to (6,1) but (6,1) is previous, occupied.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L (since moved left from (6,1)? Turn 51 moved to (6,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 52 moved L to (5,1), so direction L.\n\nThen turn 53: from (5,1), direction L, so can move U, D, L (cannot R).\n\nMove U to (5,2): occupied, collision.\n\nMove D to (5,0): wall, cannot.\n\nMove L to (4,1): free, no food.\n\nSo move to (4,1).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nEventually, I can go to (3,1), (2,1), etc., but it might take time to reach (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), I can go up from (4,1) to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, etc.\n\nThe body is in the way.\n\nIt might be messy, and I might not reach the food in time or get trapped.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat the short-life foods first and leave (5,3) for later if possible.\n\nBut to avoid the trap, from the position after eating (6,2), I can move away and not eat (6,3) immediately.\n\nFor example, at turn 51, after eating (6,2), head at (6,2), move D to (6,1) instead of U to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,1), move L to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc., and later come back for (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) has long life, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) has shorter life, but I can eat it later if I create space.\n\nWhen I moved away from (6,3), the cell might be free.\n\nBut let's see the initial plan.\n\nI think for turn 49, moving D to (4,2) is safer.\n\nThen I can eat (6,2) and possibly (6,3) if I can do without trapping.\n\nBut since eating (6,3) might cause trap if I eat all, I should not eat it.\n\nOr eat it only when the tail has moved away.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 49, move to (4,2), then turn 50 move to (5,2), turn 51 move to (6,2) eat, then turn 52 move D to (6,1), turn 53 move L to (5,1), then turn 54 move L to (4,1), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then up to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut the food at (6,3) will disappear soon, life 7 at turn 49, so at turn 54 life=3, turn 55 life=2, etc., so I can eat it by turn 55.\n\nBut from (4,1) at turn 54, to (6,3) is far, and with snake long, it might be hard.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), move to (4,2) but occupied, or to (5,1), etc.\n\nIt might not be efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should eat the (6,3) food before it disappears.\n\nAt turn 51, after eating (6,2), head at (6,2), move U to (6,3) to eat it.\n\nThen I am at (6,3) with body around, but if I don't eat (5,3), I might have space.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), head at (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move L to (5,3) to eat the food there, but (5,3) is free, so move to (5,3) eat, then grow, but then I am at (5,3) with body around, and might be trapped.\n\nIf I move L to (5,3), eat, then positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nThen adjacent: U (5,4) occupied, D (5,2) occupied, L (4,3) occupied, R (6,3) occupied, all blocked, trapped.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo to survive, I must not eat all foods; I should skip one.\n\nSince (5,3) has the longest life, I can skip it and eat only the others.\n\nBut (5,3) is +1, so I lose a point, but survival is more important.\n\nI can eat (6,2) and (6,3) but not (5,3).\n\nOr only eat one.\n\nBut let's see the score.\n\nWith two foods, I get +2, length 13, and can survive longer.\n\nWith all three, I die immediately.\n\nSo better to eat two and survive.\n\nAt turn 49, move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 50 move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51 move R to (6,2) eat (6,2)\n\nThen at turn 51, head at (6,2), move D to (6,1) instead of U to (6,3)\n\nSo not eat (6,3)\n\nThen from (6,1), move L to (5,1)\n\nThen to (4,1), and so on.\n\nThen the snake can move around the bottom or left.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), move L to (4,1), then to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then U to (1,2), etc.\n\nAnd (5,3) food is there, I can eat it later if possible.\n\nLife span 10, so by turn 58.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go to (1,3), (2,3), etc., to (5,3).\n\nBut with body, it might be possible if I have space.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might be tight.\n\nBut I can try.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the short-life foods.\n\nFor turn 49, moving D to (4,2) seems best to avoid immediate trap.\n\nThen for the moves, I can plan to eat (6,2) and then move away.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=49.\n\nSo for turn 49: action\n\nTurn 50: action\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to decide based on the state, but for the output, I think I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current and future turns.\n\nBut in practice, for the answer, I provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for this, I can provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nLet's decide.\n\nI think for turn 49, move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 50, move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51, move R to (6,2) eat\n\nThen turn 52, move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 53, move L to (5,1)\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince there is food at (5,3), I can go to eat it after.\n\nBut for now, for 5 turns, this should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,3) is not eaten, but with life span 7, it will disappear by turn 56, so I might not eat it, but it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) I can eat later.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 53, I am at (5,1), I can move to (5,2) but it is body, or to (4,1), etc.\n\nThen turn 54, from (5,1) if I move L to (4,1), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut I can turn to go up later.\n\nFor the purpose, I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo eat the (6,3) food, at turn 51, after eating (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) to eat it, but then I should not eat (5,3), so from (6,3), move L to (5,3) but not eat? (5,3) has food, if I move to it, I eat it, which I should avoid.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) but occupied, or L to (5,3) to eat, which causes trap.\n\nSo better not to eat (6,3).\n\nSo I think the sequence is:\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R  (eat at (6,2))\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nFor turn 53, from (6,1), move L to (5,1)\n\nYes.\n\nThen for turn 54, from (5,1), move L to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 53 or 54?\n\nt1=49, so turns 49 to 53 or 49 to 54?\n\nLet's say 5 turns: 49,50,51,52,53.\n\nSo actions for those.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate one food, and avoided the trap.\n\nIf I move R at turn 49, I eat one but lead to death, so worse.\n\nSo D is better.\n\nAlso, moving U at turn 49 leads to immediate death, so not good.\n\nSo only D or R, but R risky, so D safer.\n\nTherefore, for turn 49, move D.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan moves at least 5 turns ahead, considering food life spans, collision risks, and the Tail Reward Danger. The current state (turn 49) has the snake at positions [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] with head direction R. Food is available at (6,2) with life span 5 (disappears after turn 53), (6,3) with life span 7 (disappears after turn 55), and (5,3) with life span 10 (disappears after turn 58). All food is positive (+1 value).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Risks**: \n  - Moving up (U) from (4,3) to (4,4) leads to immediate entrapment, as all adjacent cells are occupied by the body.\n  - Moving right (R) to (5,3) eats the food but forces a down (D) move to (5,2) on turn 50. This path risks entrapment after eating all foods, as the snake becomes surrounded at (6,3) with no escape.\n  - Moving down (D) to (4,2) avoids immediate risks and frees the tail cell (6,3), exposing the food there. This allows flexibility to target high-priority food (e.g., (6,2) with short life span) while avoiding the Tail Reward Danger and potential entrapment.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (6,2) must be eaten by turn 53 due to its short life span (life 5 at turn 49). It is prioritized to avoid missing the reward.\n  - (6,3) can be eaten later (up to turn 55) but skipping it may be necessary to prevent entrapment, as eating all foods often traps the snake in the bottom-right corner.\n  - (5,3) has a long life span (up to turn 58) and can be targeted later if space allows.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After eating (6,2), moving down to (6,1) instead of up to (6,3) avoids entrapment and keeps the snake mobile. This path allows the snake to navigate to open areas (e.g., left or bottom-left) for future food opportunities.\n  - The sequence below eats one food ((6,2)) to increase score but skips (6,3) and (5,3) for now, ensuring survival. This balances reward with risk, as eating all foods leads to certain death.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 49-53):\n- **Turn 49**: Move **D (down)** to (4,2).  \n  - Why: Avoids entrapment (unlike U), does not eat (5,3) (unlike R), and frees (6,3) for potential future eating. No food eaten, tail moves to (6,4), exposing food at (6,3). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 50**: Move **R (right)** to (5,2).  \n  - Why: Moves toward (6,2) for imminent eating. No food eaten, tail moves. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 51**: Move **R (right)** to (6,2).  \n  - Why: Eats food at (6,2) (life span 4 at turn 51 start, disappears after this turn if not eaten). Score +1, length increases to 12. Tail stays at (5,4). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 52**: Move **D (down)** to (6,1).  \n  - Why: Avoids eating (6,3) (which would risk entrapment) and moves to open space. No food eaten, tail moves to (5,4). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 53**: Move **L (left)** to (5,1).  \n  - Why: Continues to open bottom-left area, avoiding walls and body. No food eaten, tail moves. Direction becomes L.\n\n### Outcome After 5 Turns:\n- **Score**: +1 (from (6,2)), snake length 12.\n- **Survival**: Snake is at (5,1) with open paths (e.g., to (4,1), (5,0) invalid, so left or up later). Food at (6,3) (life span 2 at turn 53 start) and (5,3) (life span 7 at turn 53 start) can be targeted later if feasible, but skipping them maintains mobility.\n- **Why Not Eat More?**: Eating (6,3) or (5,3) now risks entrapment due to the snake's coiled position. This sequence prioritizes survival over the extra +1, allowing future opportunities.\n\n### Full Action Sequence (Turns 49-53):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 49: D (down)  \nTurn 50: R (right)  \nTurn 51: R (right)  \nTurn 52: D (down)  \nTurn 53: L (left)\n}",
