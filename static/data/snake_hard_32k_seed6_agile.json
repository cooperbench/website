Despite adjacent obstacles (e.g., (2,3), retreating to (3,4) next turn avoids entrapment. \n\n**Optimal choice**: Move **L** to (2,4) for immediate score, then retreat right to (3,4) on turn 2 to proceed safely toward other foods (e.g., (4,1)).

        "thinking": "### Analysis of the Current State\n\nLet's carefully analyze the current state to determine the possible moves and their consequences.\n\n1. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Head at (2, 1), direction is Right (R).\n   - Body segments: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)] (head first, then body, then tail).\n\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - Current direction is R, so the opposite move (L) is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Right (R).\n\n3. **Adjacent Cells**:\n   - Up (U): (2, 2) \n     - Check: (2, 2) is listed as an internal obstacle (wall). Cannot move here.\n   - Down (D): (2, 0)\n     - Check: y = 0 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n   - Right (R): (3, 1)\n     - Check: (3, 1) is listed as an internal obstacle (wall). Cannot move here.\n   - Left (L): (1, 1)\n     - Check: (1, 1) is a body segment (not the tail). Moving here would cause a collision with the body. Cannot move here.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Moves**:\n   - All possible moves (U, D, R) are blocked by walls or body segments.\n   - The snake cannot move left (L) because it is the opposite of the current direction (R).\n\n### Re-evaluating the State\n\nGiven that all adjacent moves are blocked, the snake has no valid moves that do not result in a collision or wall hit. This implies that the snake is trapped and cannot make a move without dying. \n\nHowever, this seems like an unusual game state where the snake is immediately trapped with no possible moves. It's possible that there might be an error in the interpretation of the walls or the snake's position. \n\n### Possible Misinterpretations\n\n1. **Internal Obstacles Not Being Walls**:\n   - The state lists \"Internal Obstacles\" under \"Cells occupied by walls\". This suggests that internal obstacles are indeed walls, and the snake cannot move onto them.\n   - If internal obstacles were not walls, then (3, 1) and (2, 2) would be free, allowing moves R or U. However, the state clearly indicates they are walls.\n\n2. **Tail Position**:\n   - The tail is at (1, 2), which is not adjacent to the head (2, 1). Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonally. So, the tail is not accessible in one move.\n\n3. **Food Under Body**:\n   - There is no food under the snake's body in this state, so this rule does not apply.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the strict interpretation of the rules and the current state, the snake has no valid moves that do not result in a collision or wall hit. Therefore, the snake cannot make a move without dying. \n\nHowever, since the problem requires an action, and all possible actions lead to death, the only logical choice is to select one of the possible moves (even though it will result in death). \n\n### Selected Action\n\nGiven that the snake is facing Right (R), and cannot move Left (L), the possible moves are U, D, or R, all of which are blocked. \n\n- Moving Up (U) to (2, 2): Wall (internal obstacle).\n- Moving Down (D) to (2, 0): Wall (border).\n- Moving Right (R) to (3, 1): Wall (internal obstacle).\n\nSince all moves are equally invalid, we can choose any. For the sake of the answer, we'll choose to move Right (R), as it aligns with the current direction.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",
